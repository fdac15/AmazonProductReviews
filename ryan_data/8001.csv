"I've wanted to use a camera slider for a while now, but the price tends to be quite high for these.A slider allows you to mount your camera onto a ""track"" and do nice panning shots while remaining steady. You've probably seen plenty of these shots on TV, Movies and Music Videos.This particular slider comes in at just under 3 1/2 feet. Due to the placement of the camera mount, there is about 3 feet of usable space on the slider.Included with the slider is the track (39.5""), 2 feet with adjustable sides to help level it, 1 ""slider"" with a 3/8"" or 1/4"" camera mount (to mount either your camera directly or another ballhead/mount) and a padded carrying bag.I was expecting some assembly, but the entire thing goes together in about 1 minute. The slider locks into place on the track and has an adjustable ""lock"" mechanism to tighten or loosen it (to get the right amount of movement). The slider itself also has a bubble level to help make sure it's flat.The feet attach with 1 thumbscrew each (no tools needed), and it can be taken apart in about 30 seconds which was great.The one I received is actually a light blue color, not the red shown in the photo. I think the shiny blue still looks nice, but might not fit for everyones style. The majority of the product is black, the slider track is marked with white numbers for distance.Product works nice -- I would recommend some sort of panning head to attach your camera to on top of the slider for more control.Directly under the center of the slider is a tripod mount, to attach it to a tripod instead of the feet for a higher shot. The left/right (where the feet connect) also have 1/4"" threading to attach to tripods or lightstands. I haven't tried the center threading (I imagine with a heavier camera, it may be side-heavy), attaching lightstands or tripods to the left/right will probably provide the most sturdy platform.Overall, great price for this item. They do make different lengths (for about the same price) so make sure you find the length you need more. The 39.5"" one is a nice size that isn't too big.Note: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN41YW13GN59E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A851R9U#wasThisHelpful","RN41YW13GN59E","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picked this up expecting a full-head mask (front + back), unfortunately despite the description it's only a half-mask (front only, with an elastic strap). Wish I had known as I might have gotten something else.Quality is otherwise good. The hair is much nicer in person than the photo (it's much more full). Looks much more like a  ""Planet of the apes"" mask in person (due to the hair) than the preview photo.. I was actually hoping it wouldn't look like a planet of the apes mask and more of a generic monkey mask.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5D2J3W4FTCV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009USGF8E#wasThisHelpful","R5D2J3W4FTCV9","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying HDMI cables are essentially all the same. It's a digital signal, so as long as the signal gets across, it won't degrade. On the other hand, there are different versions (1.1, 1.4, etc..) which each have additional features. TV control over HDMI, Ethernet, 3D or more. From what I can tell, these cables are the latest version of the standard.The difference in quality is really just the shielding, and the one on this one is pretty nice! It's a thick cable housing with a nice appearance (black/gray) whereas most I've seen like this have a bright color like Red or Blue.The downside of these thicker cables are that they're often very stiff and hard to move around when trying to plug into the back of a TV (the cheaper cables are actually nice as they're very flexible). Fortunately, a right-angle adapter is included, allowing you to get into hard to reach spots on the TV or Home Theater accessories.With all this said.. I'm a bit hesitant to continue using it due to the other reviews. Several reviews are reporting that the connector simply broke off, getting lodged into their TV. Not a good thing! I'll see how it holds up and update this if I have any issues. For now, it's fine.Note that this product was received at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36R5QBK159YYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6SLHE0#wasThisHelpful","R36R5QBK159YYV","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying that Tomb Raider being a temporary-exclusive for the XBox one is what sold me on the console. Loving the first game, I didn't want to wait a year to play the sequal on the PS4.To rate the game fairly, I did complete it prior to this review (not 100%, but story mode). Completed the game with 61%. Accoring to Xbox, I played 10 hours. 523 enemies killed, 22 achievements earned, 3,226,728 Distance Travelled (feet??)While almost all of the reviews here focused on the positives, I wanted to point out my complaints with the game and why I didn't find it to live up to the hype. I did still enjoy the game, but I know that because this is not rated 5-stars, I will be down-voted.Graphics.. great. Really nice throughout with only a random texture here and there that looks a bit low-res. The rest is nice and polished.Being a big fan of the first Tomb Raider game, I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me the same way the first did.My disappointment comes down to a mix of storyline (it was a bit too ""Fantasy"" for my style. Trying to mix modern day ""bad guys"" alongside Magical baddies). I will say I'm not a fan of the ""Fantasy"" style in movies/games, so it was a bit of a turnoff. I didn't notice this at all in the first game, and to be honest, the story in this one reminded too much of a Resident Evil game for some reason.Characters: Same problem.. just didn't care for them. Might just be me, but I found myself a bit bored with them (and the story), but again ""YMMV"" as I'm just not into the fantasy genre much.Moves: Lara has a bunch of neat moves, weapons and they're upgraded throughout the story. While I did not see a New Game + mode, I did like the fact you can free-roam to complete the other side-quests after you finish the story line (and going through the game, I didn't have some of the stuff I needed to access these side-quests at the time, so it's perfect).Micro-transactions: The game has a Season Pass (30 bucks) and I have no problem with that. It also has ""Card Packs"" you can purchase for real money which I believe unlock additional items (costumes, skills, upgrades) which I'm not a fan at all of. While not necessary to enjoy the game, I much would have preferred these be included in the game itself, the season pass, or separately without playing a game of chance with the cards.Variety: It felt like there were really 3 locations in the game to me. A snowy/icy area, a fantasy village/town and a modern day/dry area. While going through the locations, it kept feeling to me like I was just going from one of these cities to the next, then repeating. They are nice, don't get me wrong, but it didn't feel like the variety the first game had.Gameplay: And here's where I had a bit more of a problem. You learn ""moves"" (climbs, swinging, jumping, rope sliding) and then find yourself repeating these over and over. Every location has the same textures (white ""skidmarks"" indicating a spot you can run up.. white railing indicating an area you can climb, bumpy wall indicating you can climb it or wood indicating you can shoot arrows at it). This is true regardless of where you are -- modern city, icy area or fancy village all have the same looking textures, and you perform the same moves to complete it. In the end, you probably do this several hundred times and it feels a bit old like they're having you do it just to do it. While fun at first, I found it got old a bit quick. Same applies to fights. Fight 3-guys, 5-guys, then a whole group of them (with one who is heavily armored), repeat. Lastly, collecting items along the way became a constant thing. Everywhere I go, I'd scan the area for anything I can use, collect them all, and then head to the next area -- I found I was still constantly running out of weapons in battle, despite collecting every item I could find.Puzzles: I found the puzzles to be interesting. I did find some to be a bit challenging (or not as obvious as I would have expected) but I was able to get through them all.In the end, I'm happy I got it. I won't be playing the story again (while my first thought when finishing the last tomb raider was ""I need to play that again!"") but I will continue to complete the side-quests.I didn't find it to be the great exclusive I was expecting years after the first game.. but it was a fun 10'ish hours. I don't recommend it, I just would have preferred a bit more variety to it and maybe a story that didn't involve so much ""fantasy"". If you're into that though, you might appreciate it more than I did!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEM0Y8ABLSAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVRNIQU#wasThisHelpful","R3EEM0Y8ABLSAX","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having bought a TV for a second room, I needed a stand and wanted to go for a rolling one to get the most flexibility out of it (rolling it when needed to make more space).I liked the look of the Vivo and the price was one of the best I've seen. Most rolling TV stands cost more than the TV itself.Opening the box.. it's intimidating. Hundreds of screws, bolts, washers, metal beams, tools and more. Fortunately, I found out at the end that most of these are extra parts that will vary depending on the TV you're installing. In total, I would say there are about 30 bolts that need to be attached.Setup time took about an hour. Included are 4 tools to assemble.. the only other tool I needed (not included) was a phillips head screwdriver to attach the tray. One very big issue I encountered was that one of the holes on the legs (to attach to the base) was not aligned properly and wouldn't fit (triple checked to make sure I was doing it right). Fortunately, swapping legs, the matching hole on the opposite side was also slightly offset just enough to let me attach it. If this weren't the case, I wouldn't be able to assemble it (and drilling a bigger hole is tough considering the strengthened material).Design is nice. I particularly like the ""short"" legs in the back, which make it possibly to put into a corner of a room. The 2 beams are a neat idea also (most seem to use 1 beam).When setup, the wheels will help move it around the room and the TV can tilt forwards and backwards.Overall feel when assembled was very secure. Used it with a 40"" TV and had no worries about it falling over. Make sure you use all of the necessary bolts and tighten them.With that said.. some issues:Cable management.. is terrible. The expectation is that you'll run your cables from the ground, up the ~5 1/2 feet tube, out the top, pull it back down and attach it to the TV. To do this, you'll need about a 12 foot cord and most power cables included with TVs are maybe 3-4 feet. There is no ""exit hole"" on the front, only on the very top and very bottom of each pole.This also means that using the optional tray, the wires will can't enter the cable management tube. I found both of these issues better addressed by simply using velcro cable wraps an securing them to the outside of the tubes.Problem #2: The tray. There are about half a dozen positions heights you can put the tray at, and the highest is maybe 2.5-3 feet. The pegs are only on the bottom of the pole. This might be fine for a 65"" TV, but anything smaller, the tray seems a bit too low and out of place at even the highest setting.In the end, price was great, cable management and tray aren't a dealbreaker and this thing is tough. Recommended if you need one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDGP1PVKQGAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFXO4Q4#wasThisHelpful","R1HDGP1PVKQGAU","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never tried an LED bulb, I was curious how well they would work. Picked this one up and was immediately surprised by the size (about 2x the size of a CFL). Plugged it in and immediately saw a huge difference in brightness. Lit up the entire room! Very nice, will definitely look into purchasing more of these.Note that due to the size, if using in a standing lamp or light-socket, it may be too large to fit (or will stick out more than a typical bulb will). I was fine with this sacrifice for the increased brightness.Note: I received this bulb at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18MH7YDJOID3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QB4VNR8#wasThisHelpful","R18MH7YDJOID3A","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased these as I needed a few extra HDMI cables - compared to the big box stores, 2 of these come to half the price of 1 of their cheapest cable.Fortunately, being a digital cable, there isn't much difference between a low-end and a pricier one.. the cables to feel well worth the price (not too thin) and gave me no issues. Tried with 1080p and it worked great.

"I'll start off by saying I really wanted to like this. I was hoping for a compact replacement for my other bluetooth car receiver, but in the end it's become a ""backup"" instead.I own the Flexsmart x2 receiver, so some comparisons will be related to that.. and then I'll state why I found this one to be inferior.Design: I found the design to be both ""nice"" and a bit troublesome. It's very compact but has a very ""cheap"" plastic feel to it. There are a total of 3 buttons on it: CH+, CH- and the orange button. The orange button is used to answer calls and I believe also play/pause music. On the left are 2 red LED-lit charging ports (USB cable not included) and to the right a display stating the station you're ""broadcasting"" to.Design Problems: I didn't think of it at first, but when plugged in, it sits about 1-2 inches in front of your cigarette lighter. This means that to answer calls or play/pause, you typically need to lean down pretty low to reach it (depending where your cigarette lighter port is at). The bright orange button also turns to a solid black at night time, so it's not as noticeable as you would expect. Not a huge deal.Because the adapter sits so far back into the car (opposed to a ""gooseneck"" adapter like the Flexsmart) I found that anything in the cup-holders will block access to the adapter.Ports/Power/Usability: I found the power to come on quickly, it fortunately has 2 USB charging ports and they're lit to find easily in the dark.It's pretty easy to use -- turn it on, set a station, connect to it and tune to that station on your car.Problems with ports/power/usability:There are no ports -- my other adapter has a 3.5mm input to connect to a non-bluetooth device. No deduction in score, because this one doesn't advertise this.THE POWER IS ALWAYS ON - This is my biggest problem. Even with the car off, the device stays on and provides power. This may be car-specific, but doing this will cause your battery to drain overnight or when not in use. This is a problem as if you don't see the adapter (for instance, it's behind a cup), it will create problems. It's also a downside to not be able to leave it plugged in at all times. The flexsmart has a power on/off button to turn it on.. the power off on this only turns off the LCD screen but leaves the power coming through (and LEDs on)There is no volume button (not a negative, just point this out as the flexsmart does have one, it's sometimes useful but not needed).I found that sometimes my phone would not connect to it automatically and had to turn bluetooth off and then back onIn the end... it works. If you have a car that will cut power to the auxillary port when turned off, it's not so bad. For me, I just can't recommend it. Wanted to love it, I'll keep it still, but it's just not what I was hoping for. Check your car first to see if it will work better - if your aux port is in a better spot than mine, it might be a better buy.Note that this item was received at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUOPA0ROVQYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01764YKH6#wasThisHelpful","R2XUOPA0ROVQYH","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this as it seemed like a neat idea -- small, portable christmas lights powered by 3 AA batteries.Product includes battery box (clear) with attach string of lights and a screw.Battery box has an On/Off switch (solid only, no flickering or chasing). I found the on/off switch to not work too well. When On, it was loose and kept flickering because it was moving between on/off very easily (even when left alone).The light strand is thin and very flexible (not like normal xmas lights). The battery box takes 3 AA batteries, so it gets to be a bit bulky. There is no clip on it to attach to a belt, for instance, it must be held in place or put in a pocket if used on a person/costume.The battery box was difficult to open -- it has a screw that needs to be removed each time (if you choose to use it) and while the battery door was easy to take off, it was a bit tricky to put back on.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LX7HKN6KCWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176OAZT8#wasThisHelpful","R10LX7HKN6KCWR","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this mask for a Hotline Miami costume. A lot of the masks you see online don't actually appear the same way in person -- either quality has gone down significantly, the mask is extra floppy or has other issues. This mask was surprising in that it seemed very well made and painted, the eye holes were hidden well and it worked perfectly.The only issue is with the red part at the top of the head, it constantly fell over to one side -- this was fixed by adding a small piece of cardboard to keep it stiff.I didn't have any issues with the hair shedding and it looked nice when it arrived (didn't need to be brushed).Attached image is one we used this mask for -","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2US8JDPDMZEPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO8TSCU#wasThisHelpful","R2US8JDPDMZEPJ","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this 2-pack of bottles as it was available at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review, and I had a use for some pump-bottles.Included are 2 amber colored bottles, 2 black pump-tops and 2 pieces of twine and nametags.The nametags and twine didn't do much for me -- they definitely give it an 'artsy' sort of look and mix well with the product but I was more interested due to the tinted color.The 2 I received came white and rectangular nametags (apparently they use a variety of them in different shapes, so you may receive some mismatched ones).The bottles themselves are pretty solid. They're not a very soft-plastic, which is nice, and the pump has a wide tube so they work well. I found the bottles themselves to be a bit nicer than the multi-pack clear colored ones that tend to be sold in a pack for a lower cost.In the end, the bottles worked fine. I think the asking price is a bit much -- it's not so much that the product feels cheap, but rather that the price much be too much for this type of item in general. The only real thing I found that it has going for it which differentiates it from the others are the color and the included twine + nametag. If that's exactly what you're looking for though, you may find the item more useful.I didn't find anything particularly wrong with it, rather I just didn't find anything too special about it to justify the higher asking price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ZT9H9T22L4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170BF010#wasThisHelpful","R29ZT9H9T22L4C","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fifth Element was one of the earlier Blu-Rays (2006) and had its share of problems. In 2007 it was released as a Remastered disc which improved on many of those issues.In 2015, it was released under sony's new ""Remastered in 4K"" series in 2 different formats: A Blu-Ray only version and a ""Supreme Cinema"" series which includes a book. Both versions include the SAME disc.. the supreme cinema series only includes a book alongside it.Owning several versions of The Fifth Element on VHS, DVD, Superbit DVD, UMD, Digital download and all 3 Blu-Rays.. I definitely prefer the current Blu-Ray.Video-wise, I found it to be a slight upgrade over the earlier blu-rays (it's a bit more vibrant, but other than that it's not too noticeable)Audio-wise, it not includes a 7.1 Dolby Atmos soundtrack which was amazing (and sounded like an upgrade even on a non-atmos setup compared to the 2011 release)Extras-wise, it includes all of the features available from the DVD that never made it to blu-ray (on the downside, they're not in HD).In the end, is it worth it?I hear the Supreme Cinema book has its issues, but the standalone release comes in a nice slipcover and normal blu-ray case, looks better, sounds better, has a bunch of extras and is definitely affordable.You won't see the same upgrade as in other titles like Leon (regular blu ray vs. re-release) but for a fan, I'm not disappointed.

"Purchased these for use with alcohol-activated paints.Note that these are ""detail brushes"" and are very thin and narrow to get small, precise lines. If you're looking for more of a general brush, you'll want to look elsewhere.(Note that I'm holding these to a higher standard as they're considered to be AIT ART's ""Premium"" line -- they also sell standard brushes at about half the price (same price for double the brushes))Having used a variety of brushes ranging from the throwaway-type (dollar-store quality) to higher-end and special FX brushes, I'd say these are somewhere inbetween. You definitely notice a difference when using higher end brushes, but these are almost much nicer than the standard discount variety brushes.The brushes come packaged in a protective  (light cardboard) box that can be re-used for storage if needed. I wouldn't call it a ""nice"" box by any means, but this set is also not advertising it as a storage box (like some of their other products include), so this is just information-only.The brushes all came with individual plastic sleeves to protect them during shipment, and the included details note a 1-year satisfaction guarantee if you have any trouble with them.I used each of the brushes multiple times and compared with others (such as the bdellium brushes) and found the results to be generally good. Some of the brushes did seem to be a bit sparse on fibers and one in particular didn't work well at all with painting (the largest bristled brush). Purchasing these for details, I was more concerned with the smaller brushes and they seemed to work generally well.For cleaning, I used the strongest cleaner I had: Cinema Secrets Brush Cleaner which cleaned the brushes quickly and none of the fibers were released (some of the lesser-prices brushes will lose hairs or loosen up in this cleaner).Design-wise, I think they look nicer in the photos. I found them to look a little ""cheap"" in person compared to the photos which show a nice shiny chrome look, but it doesn't affect the quality and the brushes still look ""OK"" -- again, I'd say it's inbetween the cheap brushes and the nicer ones (a bit closer to the ""nice"" side than the ""cheap"" side).After purchasing, I received an email from AIT offering a discount on future brushes. To be honest, I don't feel like I'll be using this discount on another set (this was the only ""premium"" brush set I found from AIT, and I'm not sure if I'd like to see what their standard brushes are like).I purchased these brushes at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

"May have just received a ""bad batch"" but the stickers I received were all very difficult to remove. The cuts to separate them seemed to dig too deep into the backing, so trying to peel a sticker resulted in peeling the paper up.

"I'll start off by saying I have a big selection of ""good"" cameras (ranging from mirrorless to DSLRs) but there's something neat about an instant film camera. Being able to take pictures and have no clue if they'll turn out (and each one costing you money) is a bit scary to jump into, and there will definitely be shots you don't like.. but that randomness is one of the more enjoyable parts to it.I originally purchased the Mini 8 camera and the 210 ""Wide"" camera. I immediately loved the Mini8, but the 210 Wide seemed much less user friendly (huge, lots of settings that aren't very clear, different focus distances to set), but I bought it for the ""wide"" prints (as big as 2 Mini prints).Unfortunately, the 210 Wide camera just gave terrible results. Some parts overexposed, some underexposed, while the same shots with the Mini8 were beautiful. The 210 also required a bit more (twice the batteries, larger film, a ""closeup"" adapter (that arrived broken). In the end, I sent the 210 back and kept the Mini 8.The Mini 8 is actually a nice size. It's a bit bulky, but nothing too bad at all. It's very easy to use (open the lens, it will tell you which setting to pick (a LED will light up), select it and press the shutter button. There are ""settings"" for indoors, outdoors, High-Key, etc..  and with the light up LED it's very easy to tell which you need to use.The viewfinder is relatively close to the lens, giving a ""pretty accurate"" representation of what the shot will look like. The viewfinder on the 210 was a bit too far from the lens and always gave me odd framing.The Mini8 uses the Instax Mini prints -- they come in packs of 10 (usually in 2-packs -- 20 shots). The camera will hold 10 at a time, so one thing to keep in mind with the size is that unless you want only 10 shots per outing, you'll need to bring extra packs and that's where the cost (and extra bulk) come from.I like the way the prints look. They're definitely a vintage/washed out/overexposed look most of the time, but it's neat to have! I would say it would be fine for kids to use, except they may be a little trigger-happy with the shutter button (and 10 shots = about 10 bucks).Overall, I really like it. I wasn't expecting to (I was expecting more from the 210 wide instax to be honest) but it impressed me so much, I ordered 8 extra boxed of film for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5QXW918H6ILB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWKJPMC#wasThisHelpful","R5QXW918H6ILB","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally picked up an Instax Mini 8 and loved it. It was a nice, convenient way to get portable prints. Only problem was that the prints were really small. About the size of a credit card (and thats including the border -- the actual print was much smaller than that).I saw a lot of mixed reviews on the 210 (and 300) ""Wide"" cameras, but decided to chance it.Right off the bat, the thing is huge (talking bigger than a high-end DSLR huge) and feels very plastic'y. I'm fine with both of these, I use DSLRs and plastic works as long as it works. Problem is, pieces arrived snapped off (like the closeup filter), there are a number of settings (0.9-3 meters, 3 meters to infinity, self-explanatory), Normal/Dark/Light (adjusts the brightness of the image), and most of them aren't very clear. I found I would have to take a shot, wait, adjust from there and hope the 2nd one turns out better.The lens-placement (vs viewfinder) is quite a bit off, often resulting in shots (at least portrait-style) being oddly placed in the frame, but my biggest gripe was that the quality just wasn't comparable to the instax. I'm not sure if it's the lens, the flash, but I found many images coming out both overexposed and underexposed (due to the flash, I believe). Taking the same shot on the Instax Mini 8 resulted in a nice looking image (albeit half the size)I was really wanting to like the 210.. the fact that the prints are twice as big at the same cost ha me very interested.. but after using it (or at least trying to -- the closeup filter was broken) I'll be returning it.I don't really know what they can fix to make it better.. it sounds like the 300 is more or less the same camera.. but whatever they're doing on the Mini 8.. it's working!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LR7X045556LI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NUP0D2#wasThisHelpful","R3LR7X045556LI","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A month ago, I've never heard of ""Pro Aiir"" -- I picked up a bottle at a local event to try out (previously I've used EBA's VIBE (water-based), Endura (Alcohol based), Ben-Nye Magicolor (water-based), Skin Illustrator (Alcohol) and Mehron liquid facepaint).The EBA lines were nice color with a great fragrance, but expensive (sold in 1 oz bottles for about the price of this stuff in a 2 oz. bottle). The Alcohol ones also tended to clog my airbrushes a bit (since so much of it settles in the bottle, even a lot of shaking it will leave clogs).Ben Nye and Meh-Ron were both nice, but only water-based. Skin Illustrator seemed very overpriced for ""watered-down"" looking colors.Pro-Aiir comes in a few sizes.. I think they sell as low as 0.5 oz. samples.. the common sizes are the 2.1 and 4.2 ounce sizes (they sell 8/16/64 ounce ones, but there doesn't really seem to be any discount on them other than maybe a couple bucks).I picked up half a dozen colors and have had good luck.The liquid works straight out of the bottle (no need to water it down or mix with other stuff), and goes on smooth at a low PSI. I like the way the colors look, they last long (I still can't tell what they mean by ""Hybrid"" as, as far as I can tell, it's all alcohol-based). The paint is very watery which is nice (Endura tends to be very thick out of the bottle).Some colors seem to have a nice fragrance, others have models complaining (black, for example -- I noticed the ""Smells like mildew"" comment from someone, which might be a problem with some colors). I've also heard that some colors (like white) need to be worked differently (higher PSI, layered more) to get the same coverage, which can be a challenge if going between lots of colors.One small gripe is that the labeling is very inconsistent. I purchased 6 different ones, and received 3 different types of labels. Not a big deal, but it's nice to have some consistency among bottles.In the end, worked great.. happy with it..

"Originally picked up one of these from another brand and really liked it. Saw this 2-pack available at a discounted rate and decided to go for it also.Product seems to be identical to the other Silicone Ice Cube Trays (a good thing), has minimal branding on it (not a big deal, but some have a large company name or bright blue color tray opposed to the black of these trays.Makes 2x2"" cubes, easy to remove due to the silicone tray (no more ""cracking"" the ice cubes out).My only complaint is that the trays appear to be made to ""stack"" (they have a slight groove on them to lay on top), however putting 3 trays in the freezer for 15 hours, only the top one was solid ice (the bottom 2 had a frozen exterior and mostly water inside -- not good for ice cubes).

"The Skin Illustrator palette's are great.. I saw this liquid being advertised as both a Palette refill and an Airbrush liquid. Seemed like a nice multi-use product and the bottle was decently sized.Unfortunately, with use I just wasn't happy with the value for the price.To me, it seemed way too watered-down with Alcohol (I bought 4 different colors, so it's not just a one-off). They were very thin which made using it with an airbrush very easy, but it was translucent that it was pretty unusable.As a palette refill, it worked better. You squeeze some into your Skin Illustrator palette, mix it in with a brush and then heat it with a hair dryer until it hardens. Nice for that (since until recently, they didn't sell refills), however since it's so watered down, even though you have a 2 oz. bottle it doesn't fill up much of a palette. At the price (about 1/3 the price of a palette) you're better off buying a new palette and getting 10 colors instead of these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158ARS4DSD4EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7OLAV6#wasThisHelpful","R158ARS4DSD4EI","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picked up a few low-lying fog machines and 4 different types of Froggys Fog to try out with them.Went with the Freezin Fog Juice, Velocity, QuikBlast and their un-named generic fog.The Freezin fog is designed for use in a chiller -- the fog will stay low to the ground, but you need to cool it down first. Some fog machine have an ice-basket built in which will help, but once it heats up it will begin to raise.The biggest difference I noticed with the Freezin fog is just how thick it is. I ran it through 400w machines and it went through very smoothe, producing a very thick white smoke/fog -- the most dense I've seen of any fog juices I've tried.. it came out solid white in a way that it can't be seen through.The branding implies it's for use outdoors, and I can definitely see why. Within 30 seconds it can fill a small room with a thick white layer that will keep you from seeing more than a few inches in front of you. The smoke was probably twice as full as their generic fog fluid, and about 5-6 times the Quikblast/Velocity fogs.With that, the ""hang time"" was very high - it lasted a LONG time indoors, which is why its probably recommended for outdoors (most will dissipate very quickly outdoors). If you're looking for an indoor ""haze"", this may be too much depending on the size of the room. In a larger area it should work, but in a house it will likely turn into much more than a haze (and look like smoke)Very good at what it does, I was very surprised. Just remember you'll need a ""chiller"" if you intend to keep it low to the ground. If you're looking for fog that's got a good thickness, is cheap but not as overwhelming as this (for indoors, something that will leave a light haze), look into the generic Froggys Fog bottles. For something that will disappear completely within about 45 seconds (no haze) the Velocity juice is great. For something that will be gone in 20-25 seconds, look into Quikblast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33P8IC593IMDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DJZNHW#wasThisHelpful","R33P8IC593IMDV","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally a big fan of Pee Wee content, I was looking forward to seeing this.I remember seeing the 1981 special about 10 years ago and enjoyed it, I've always liked the movies and TV show.. I figured this would be a great watch. And for the most part, I did enjoy it.The Blu-Ray clocks in at 89 minutes (including a short intro and credits) and I felt that the show may have run a bit better at an hour long.The set design was perfect -- looked straight out of the 80's show. Almost like the entire set was put into storage and cleaned off, looking good as new. Everything seemed to be in place, the props were all there.. great job and probably one of the best things to see in the special.Camera work was also good - lots of moving around, different camera angles and cameras setup for specific shots.. they did a nice job filming it!Video was also good - while only 1080i, I didn't notice the issues some have (with motion). Audio was in english and english closed captions were also included - I didn't see any other issues. Blu-Ray is listed for Regions A, B, C but one of the reviews states it ONLY works in Region A players.The show plays out as an hour and a half long stage show and they do keep a pretty good flow throughout. My issue with the show is that so much of it was re-used from the 1981 special (Live at the Roxy - available on DVD). What I mean by this are that not only are jokes similar or references to the earlier show, but the same lines are used (almost throughout the special) nearly word-for-word.The new content making current references (such as 4square and twitter) also came off a bit odd - I was almost expecting to hear ""Myspace"" references in it!The show is still entertaining (though I did feel it went a bit long), but it would have been nice to see more than the same jokes. Even the ""Mr. Bungle"" short film makes an appearance in this one, while characters from the original show (Captain Carl/Phil Hartman) are missing (for obvious reasons), having some of their jokes/references moved to other characters.The only extra is an audio commentary (which is a nice bonus). I would really have loved some behind the scenes features such as bringing the playhouse back and making it look so authentic 30 years later.I was really looking forward to this, but seeing it was almost a word-for-word remake in parts, it left me a bit disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0A48E5U6B7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00546032K#wasThisHelpful","R3B0A48E5U6B7L","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently purchased ""QuickBlast"" (or ""QuikBlast"") from Froggys Fog - it's meant to be a very fast dissipating fog (gives smoke/fog effect but then disappears completely within about 10-15 seconds). QuickBlast is made mostly for up-shot foggers like a Chauvet (fog shoots up, quickly disappears) and did a good job at that.Velocity is very similar except it has a longer hangtime of closer to 45 seconds. I found this to be a good time if not using an up-shot fogger. It will give you the fog you want but then quickly disappear completely. When I say ""Disappear Completely"", I mean that it won't leave a trace of haze.One of the big problems of using fog machines indoors are that most fogs leave a haze in the air after the fog goes away.. and this can last quite a while or require you to open windows, doors and turn on fans. Velocity and Quickblast are nice in that they give you the smokey fog effect then disappear.Note, if you want to keep the haze around (for effect, ambient or to use with lazers/lights, etc..) you won't want to use this fog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VB8P4DW16M2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B46LFO#wasThisHelpful","R2VB8P4DW16M2A","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a variety of different fog liquids in the past - some will come out as a thick white smoke, others a very mild ""hazy"" look, some will hang in the air as a haze for 20-30+ minutes.. I wanted something that will give a nice smoke effect but then disappear quickly after.QuikBlast did a nice job at this. It seems to be made for ""quick blasts"" of smoke (such as an air cannon or a Chauvet Geyser that fires upwards), but it did work fine in both a regular and low-lying fog machine.The liquid is odorless and the 1 gallon size will go a long way. The smoke came out as a nice thick smoke and began to fade very quickly afterwards. The biggest difference is the lack of a constant haze after using it. Most liquids when used indoors will keep a layer in the air until completely aired out, this one tends to disappear within about 30 seconds (for the most part) and should be totally cleared within a minute.Froggys makes several different liquids in this type (QuikBlast, Velocity, Fast Dissipating Fog) and I wish there was a better description of each, since they sound similar.If you're using a geyser machine, this is the fog you want. If you're using it for stage/effects and want something that will give the effect but not linger on for more than a minute, this stuff works nice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXUYGPPCTXQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B42EQY#wasThisHelpful","R1MXUYGPPCTXQX","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picked this up to replace another air-vent mount that uses a push-to-close method of gripping, which stopped working as well.This one uses a ""Pull to open"" method instead, providing a constant grip on the phone which is much better.Product quality is good, the grip is tight and it's compact. A ballhead allows rotation as needed to get the right angle.Unfortunately, the large clip makes it difficult to attach to some vents. My prior mount used a slim spring grip (and had a support mount to keep the vents from drooping down) while this one uses 2 different grip mounts. I found the grip was too large in size, no matter how I used it. I was able to get it to fit, but in doing so it puts pressure and stretches the air vents out.The weight of the product also causes the vent to droop (most other air vent mounts I've used have had the optional support brace to prevent this.Nice product, I love the size and the grip, but the other issues prevent me from giving it 5 stars.Note: This product was received at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ZBSQWR93TQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT9KF0W#wasThisHelpful","R36ZBSQWR93TQR","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many people enjoyed Windows 8 (and 8.1), but many also didn't. Windows 10 seems to try to satisfy both sides and does a good job at it.Included in this package is a USB drive for installing Windows 10 (a change from the DVDs used in past versions, but a necessary one seeing that many newer devices no longer have a CD/DVD Drive). Note that if you download Windows 10, you can create a bootable USB copy within windows.NOTE: Windows 10 is also available FREE to those currently running Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 -- if you own these, you DO NOT need to purchase this. If you're running Windows XP, Vista or no copy of windows at all (building your own PC) this is the product you want.I've been running windows 10 on 3 different systems: Tablet (Surface Pro), Desktop and Desktop (with multi-touch).Installing: None had any issues, all drivers & programs worked right off the bat, including multiple monitors, hard drives and input devices (including wireless mice, keyboards, Wacom tablets)Windows now uses a combination of the Windows 7 start menu and Windows 8 ""start screen"" -- the start menu is back, but now includes a small section for pinning apps to (similar to windows 8). You can re-arrange, resize and remove these as needed. Modern apps (form the Windows App Store) still feature live tiles, so if you pin a Weather app and Email app, you'll see how many unread emails you have and a brief overview of the weather.You can bring back the Windows 8/8.1 start screen in the options if you prefer it (such as using a tablet)Opening any apps are now standalone and resize-able. In windows 8 and 8.1, these ran full screen and could be cut down to half-screen. In Windows 10 you can resize them and move them around like any other program. This is nice since some applications are useful to have (such as an Instagram client, which doesn't have a native Windows application) without forcing it full-screen. New apps can be downloaded from the Windows Store. Apps can be stretched to ""full screen"" like in Windows 8/8.1, but are not required.There is now a Notifications center. Get a twitter message, 4 emails and 2 instagram likes? you can see these instantly in the Notifications Center (similar to that on a smartphone)Also new is ""Cortana"", the virtual assistant. Cortana is similar to Siri on an iphone (and Cortana has been available on Windows Phones for a while). It docks near the start button and allows you to either talk to it (""What time is it in New York?"", ""What it 50 x 143?"", ""Remind me to buy eggs tomorrow"") or type in the search box.  This is nice as it scans your email and includes information - I placed an order on eBay and got a shipping email and Cortana offered to track it and provide updates for me. I know some won't like Cortana, but if you use it a few times you'll find it useful.Icons have been updated - they look much more basic than the Windows 8/8.1 icons -- not a huge fan of these (everything in the file viewer seems to be made to look too clean/basic) but I'm also not annoyed by them. Everything does seem to be a bit smaller (such as the taskbar buttons for applications).Virtual Desktops are new, allowing you to create a 2nd or 3rd desktop and quickly switch between them. This is useful if you want to have one setup for art (Photoshop, Illustrator) and another for web browsing, without being overhwelmed with open applications at the same time. Click to Desktop 1 and you'll only see the photoshop/illustrator programs, click Desktop 2 and you'll only see the browser. Even nicer, the ""Task View"" button on the taskbar will give a quick overview of all open windows: If you have 5 browsers open, this will show a live preview of each and let you quickly locate the one you're looking for.Classic applications all work - I did an in-place upgrade from Windows 8.1 on 3 computers and had NO incompatible hardware or software.The ""Favorites"" option in the file viewer has been replaced with a Quick Access option that provides similar functionality.Windows Snap is back - drag a window to the left or right side and it will snap to that half of the screen. This includes a new 1/4 snap feature if you drag it to a corner (it will snap to that corner, taking up 25% of the screen and allowing you to snap more windows)Xbox is now built into Windows 10.. sorta?Xbox allows you to stream games from your Xbox One to your Windows 10 PC. This is done over the network and seems to work well. I would recommend a wired network for both the Xbox and PC, but it works fine on wireless if not needed for super-quick movements. NOTE: You'll need to plug your Xbox One controller into your PC (you can't use it while connected to your XBox One, from what I can tell). There will apparently be a wireless adapter coming later this year.Speed: Speed was about similar, possibly a bit faster for me than Windows 8 and 8.1. The earlier version was already very quick and Windows 10 seems to improve on that.The Charms menus (holding your mouse in the corner) from Windows 8/8.1 have been removed, and replaced with a much easier to use (in my opinion) set of options in the Notifications Center.I've been really enjoying Windows 10, especially since it is offered as a free-upgrade to earlier OS owners. If buying a new OS (none installed, or using something before Windows 7) this is a nice upgrade since it has the best of both worlds.If upgrading, you will have a very easy option to ""roll back"" to windows 8 or 8.1, but this option is only available for 30 days after upgrading to Windows 10.If I did have a complaint, it's that the OS doesn't seem like a large upgrade over 8.1. In fact, I could have seen them releasing this as 8.2 (or 8.5) since most of the features people will use are added on. Additionally, some stuff appears to be heavily updated and running in a newer, more modern view while other programs are running in a dated-looking classic view. An example is the Settings menu which provides a very visual and large modern experience to change settings, while the Control Panel looks the same as it did 10 years ago. My Computer looks the same as Windows 7 while other parts seem brand new.  Lastly, some user interface elements seem a bit dated - the start menu (if removing the recently used items) has a large blank space that you can't add on to. This seems like a big oversight.I feel a bit odd giving this a 5 star rating, but I honestly feel Microsoft did a good job at this. I upgraded all 3 of my workstations and have been using Windows 10 for a while without issues (it was previously in a pre-release state for the public to install). No blue-screens, everything worked (applications & hardware) and seems to be improved.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHTJTNEVJONY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01019T6O0#wasThisHelpful","RHTJTNEVJONY1","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picked this up because it was cheap.. really cheap! About 20 bucks for the machine.Item itself is fairly small/compact and the handle is really nice. Doesn't hold much fog juice, but also doesn't need to (it goes a long ways)Cap in back of machine unscrews to let you fill it with fog -- the fog container is not removable (like some machines) so if you want to change fog liquid you'll need to pour out the old fluid.Machine warms up in about 3 minutes and runs for about a minute before needing to heat up again (about 1 minute). Light on remote turns green when ready, hold to release fog (NOTE: You need to HOLD the button - some machines have an ""On"" button to keep constant fog, this doesn't)Output is good with the cheaper fog liquids, but the higher-end ones (like Froggys) seemed to be too much for it.Had mine for a few months, used maybe 20 times (about 15 minutes at a time) and it just stopped one day. Pump works, but a burning smell comes out (and leaks brown liquid.. probably not good).Contacted the company, apparently it only had a 30 day limited warranty (???), I guess for the price it's expected.Fog output was decent while it lasted. I'd probably buy another one if it was a bit more reliable (if  you need it and it just ""doesnt wanna work"" any more, you're kind of out of luck)With that said, if you only need it for halloween, it's not a bad machine. Keep in mind you need to hold the button on the remote to fire it.I'd honestly look into the 1byone machines on Amazon if you want a cheap fog machine. Not much more and seems to be better quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZ0K4AFP6PFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DFSIW4#wasThisHelpful","R2YZ0K4AFP6PFS","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice ""Good"" fog at a low price. I used this with a Low-Lying Fog Machine (400w) and had no problems running it through the 400w machine. Compared to the halloween fogs sold in stores, the price is better and quality is higher.It's hard to see, but this is ""Froggys Fog"" which is a maker of some of the best fog liquids out there. It's also the smallest size they offer (from what I can tell). Unfortunately, I can't tell which version of Froggys it is.I will say, this product is for the 32oz size -- you can get a 1 gallon size (about 4x the size) for about twice the price. Keep this in mind if buying for longer-term use.The fog comes in a nice, re-sealable bottle and is odor-free.The fog came out white and a good thickness -- some lower-end fogs will come out as more of a fog, I would say this is more of a thick smoke and if used in a small area will make it very difficult to see through at first.The fog is not fast-dissipating (meaning it WILL hang in the air as a light haze). Some people like this (good for clubs) but can create problems if using it indoors (it will stay looking ""hazy"" for a good while until aired out). If using outdoors, will work very well.If looking for something that won't hang in the air as long, check out Froggy's version of Velocity or Fast Dissipating Fluid -- these will give the initial smoke/fog but then quickly disappear and not leave a trace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOK2MQM6KIIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UQWT6W#wasThisHelpful","R1UOK2MQM6KIIY","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fog machine was purchased to replace a much smaller fog machine of the same power (400 watts) - I bought it both as a replacement as well as for the ""low lying fog"" effect.PRICE: Price was good! I purchased the version with Wireless remote control. There was no remote control in the box. There weren't even instructions in the box. There also wasn't a ""Plastic Water Bag"" in the box.QUALITY: It works! But see above. Lots of missing accessories.Additionally, the exterior seems fine but once you start using it, it feels very ""cheap"". The chiller tray i lined with a very thin aluminum and plain styrofoam. The tubes are very light-weight also, something that could present a problem later on.FEATURES: Wireless remote control! (Well, I paid for it but it wasn't in the box. So forget about that). Apparently the wired remote control is the receiver for the wireless one, so if you plan to operate wirelessly you STILL need to plug the bulky wired control in.Wired remote control has a very thick wire, feels good quality but is a basic fog remote (light turns on when ready) but the nice thing is that this is a physical switch to turn the fog on or off. Turn it on and it will continuously output fog whenever ready -- a nice change from the ""Hold to shoot fog"" that most fog machines use, so I'll give it credit for that.BUILD: Lots of removable pieces.The fog tank is a removable bottle (which is nice - I prefer this over the fog machines that you fill directly into the machine).The cap for it has a hose that goes into the bottle to pull the fluid. Since the hose isn't ""locked"" in place, you need to make sure it reaches the bottom of the bottle to pull the fog juice out.There is a little white hose coming out the back to drain water (more on that later..) - It's supposed to hook up to a plastic water bag of some sort, but there was none in my box.The front half of the fog machine opens with a latch and a thumb-screw-lid to exposure a compartment to add ice to (more on that below also..)FUNCTION: So it's pretty straightforward. Fill the bottle with fog juice, turn the machine on (and optionally add ice to the chiller box in front), wait for it to warm up and hit the remote control.WARM UP TIME: I found this to be at least twice as long as my other machines (same wattage). It took about 5 minutes to warm up (there was a slight burning smell at that point -- doesn't bother me, but I know it bothers some, so I wanted to mention it). At that point it will fire for approximately 30 seconds of fog. When you first hit the button you'll hear the pump (load) but after a couple seconds that noise goes away.Most fog machines shoot outwards once heated, this one (being a 'low lying' fog machine) has an additional box on the front.. the fog fires into this box, hits an aluminum wall and then moves upwards (this is where ice would be if you add it) and continuing out to the front of the machine.If you fill the box with ice, this will chill the fog and send out a ""cooler"" fog that will stay low to the ground (most fogs will rise because of the heat). A few issues here are:* The box holds very little ice. I see some of these that hold pounds of ice, I'd be surprised if this even held a full icecube tray worth of ice.* The ice doesn't last long. Within about 15-20 minutes, it was gone)* The ice turns to water and goes out the little white tube in the back. This is supposed to connect to the water bag - if you don't use something to catch it, it will go straight to the floor.If you don't use ice, the machine will work similar to a fog machine (the ""wall"" might slow down the output, however). It's also recommended to buy ""Low Lying Fog"" such as something from Froggys Fog and not the cheap stuff.BONUS: If you leave the ""ice tray"" open, fog will go straight-up (not like a burst, more of an upward-pointed fog machine) which is a nice benefit if you have a use for it.So whats the verdict?Price was cheap, quality seemed cheap (but it works!), lots of missing pieces inside. Warm up time about 2x longer than similar machines and the burst-times were low (30 seconds at a time before needing a minute to get ready for more?), cheap/bargain fog machines are usually better than that. The tubes also seem fragile if you plan to travel with it at all.SIZE: A big surprise was the size -- this thing was pretty big. The ice compartment takes up about half the size of the machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75MGZQVEMZE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KW277ZM#wasThisHelpful","R75MGZQVEMZE2","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Product is  of high quality - a soft foam interior with a soft exterior case (waterproof). There are 2 pieces (a larger one and smaller one) attached by a flexible connector to fit most uses. The smaller piece has 2 suction cups (one on each side), the larger has 5 (2 left, 2 right, 1 center). The suction cups do hold well in place (meaning they won't fall off on their own), however they do slide when coming into contact with water (which is what it's made for) - only mentioning this since it's listed as ""Non Slip"".Received notice of lifetime guarantee from Gorilla Grip, which was very nice.

"Having not seen this show since it aired on TV, I wasn't sure how well it would hold up over the years (a lot of shows don't). I decided to take a chance and pick  up the box set, hoping for the best but not having the highest expectations.Shout Factory, the company releasing this product, has had some problems over the years with their releases - even some of their bigger titles haven't had the greatest video presentation. For them to release a full 5 seasons of a show from the 80's,  I was expecting it to be a release to get the content out and not much else.Fortunately, I was wrong -- they did a great job on this release!The set comes in a very sturdy matte-box package (much sturdier than other releases I own which use a flimsy box). This is both nice (sturdy!) but also a bit of an issue as the cases are very hard to remove since it's such a tight-fit. Inside the box are 2 large blu-ray cases (each holding 4 discs -- seasons 1 & 2 on the first case, seasons 3, 4, 5 on the second case, a total of 8 discs)The discs are listed as Region A onlyYou can get  a full listing of whats on each  disc by looking behind the discs inside the case (the case is a transparent blue, so you can view the disc listing). I would have liked a paper insert with this content, but this still works fine!Content: The content holds up surprisingly well. I know a lot of kids' shows don't hold up over the years, but this one is still entertaining today. It definitely requires you to be able to stand the randomness, but if you do you'll love it. Included are 45 episodes, including the Christmas SpecialVideo: This is where my big concern was going to be. This show started in 1986 and was a TV show. Fortunately, it was shot on film and was kept safe over the years..Shout Factory did a complete restoration, scanning and cleaning up the original film content. I believe it was mentioned that while the show was shot on film, it was finalized in Standard Definition with the completed effects. Shout Factory went in and re-created some of these (such as the word of the day) to present the entire show in High Definition. They did a very faithful job on this, and I don't think anyone will be upset. It's presented in 1080i (despite what the box says, its not 1080p), 4:3 ratio (meaning black bars on the left/right)The detail is incredible -- you can see strings on the puppets and the detail on pee-wee's jacket (it's actual a striped black/white very close together, not a solid grey). There is a noticeable grain, and it appears to be sharpened, but the detail seen is well worth it (especially when you compare it to the way it originally looked). Colors are bright and vibrant.Audio: I'm listening on a soundbar and didn't notice any issues. Box stated it's in Stereo/Mono english. English subtitles are included.Extras: The set has a nice set of extras! The Christmas Special includes an audio commentary.  There are a number of (newly produced) extras, including interviews and featurettes. Very interesting to watch now, 30 years later!Overall, highly recommended. The price is a bit high, but considering the content I'm completely satisfied with it. Great job on this release!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9P7L7AKWONA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHH21FY#wasThisHelpful","R1B9P7L7AKWONA","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a big fan of Robot Chicken since the beginning. Having not seen the new series on TV, I was looking forward to this release.The biggest disappointment, right off the bat, is that there is NO Blu-Ray release this time around. This is weird because not only is it 2015, but seasons 5 and 6 were on Blu-Ray (along with some of the special episodes like DC and Star Wars)The other kind of weird thing is that it comes in a regular (white) Blu-Ray case without a slipcover. Kind of a bummer since the earlier releases had really digipack cases.. this one is kinda plain. Included inside are 2 discs and an episode guide (which is nice to have!)Each disc has about 10 episodes and in total runs 220 minutes. Episodes are uncensored and each has an optional commentary.Content: I still like the show, but I didn't find this series as good as the previous ones. It has its moments for sure and I don't regret picking it up!Video: Unfortunately, it's DVD only. Quality is not up to the standard of the recent blu-rays at all. The disc is anamorphic widescreen (""no black bars"") and generally ""Good quality"" but its ""DVD Good Quality"", and will be a letdown if you're used to Blu-Rays (including the previous seasons of this). Lots of aliasing, blurriness and compression was visible to me.Audio: I didn't notice any issues, but I was listening on a 2.1 soundbar.Extras: As mentioned above, plenty of commenties but also a 'christmas special' and some behind the scenes features.Overall, a nice package still - I'd give it about a 3.5 (and the earlier sets a higher score).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECAZBOUAE3D7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBJSONS#wasThisHelpful","R1ECAZBOUAE3D7","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Came across this while looking for Region Free 3D titles not released in the US.This disc comes region-free (will work in US players). I didn't notice a 2D option on the menu, but I assume it plays in 2D on a non-3D TV/Player. This is real ""3D"" and not the red/blue glasses type.The disc runs about an hour and 20 minutes, divided into 12 segments.The content seems to be filmed exclusively for the disc. Most is set against a solid black backdrop with a stage in front (not the most interesting) - the part that makes it interesting are the effects used (fog, lighting, projection mapping, reflection), but there are also some CG effects and camera techniques to make it look a little too artsy (routines where the camera angle is is focused only on the shoes/feet for the entire length, and that image duplicated on screen several times). It seems like they tried a little too hard to make parts artsy and it just came off as annoying/boring.The 3D is decent. It's not terribly impressive since most of the girls are on the same plane without much separation (in front or behind) to give depth. There are angles where it works better, but never saw anything impressive with the 3D.Most of the 3D seems to be depth (going further into the TV) opposed to pop out (coming towards you) with a few exceptions. Didn't notice ghosting.A lot of the content seems repetitive (""Didn't I already see this 5 minutes ago??""), is split up with interviews with someone between sets, and seems to be a little long (even at 80 minutes)The disc is dubbed into Russian and has no english subtitles. I imagine I'm not missing much with the dialog between sets, but it's a bit annoying as it was clearly in another language (heard in the background) and has a russian dub playing over it).In the end, it had some neat moments. The fog, lighting and reflections effects were good, the 3D was neat at times, but it just seemed a little too long and a little underwhelming with the 3D. The disc was cheap enough to not be disappointed in it -- another region free option is available with an english dub (for about 10 bucks more), but it honestly wouldn't have been worth the extra money for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNLZOROPH1PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH9OLS0#wasThisHelpful","R2PNLZOROPH1PD","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use paper seamless in the studio but wanted a more portable option for on-locationshoots.The Impact backdrop comes in a zippered bag about 2 feet in diameter. I'll start off by saying the bag has a really nice loop handle on it (good for attaching to a bag) that will hold up to wear. Using cheap reflectors int he past, these handles always tore off in a matter of a few uses, this one's holding up.The bag is a solid black with the Impact logo on the front  (would've preferred a solid black without branding), theres about a 1x1 foot ""window"" cut on the front, allowing you see what's inside (helpful if you have a black/white backdrop in one and a blue/green in another)The product unfolds easily (folding it back is a bit trickier, but after a few times you would be used to it)It unfolds to about 5 feet x 7 feet -- it's BLACK on one side and WHITE on the other. Neither side is completely solid (if theres strong backlighting, it ill shine through). It appears to be 2 layers of fabric (one for each color) which gives a nicer feel than the single-piece double-colored ones. It's a nice cloth fabric and not the typical nylon materia I'm used to with reflectors.The backdrop unfolds to a pretty flat shape -- it's also got straps on all sides to attach it to lightstands, backdrop stands, etc.. (I use a ""Background disc holder"" which attaches to the top of a lightstand and clips the top of this -- seems to be easier with 1 stand, but if you have 2+ stands the velcro may be more stable)You can have someone hold it behind a model, set it against a wall, etc..I've had very good luck shooting with it. It doesn't come out perfectly smooth (the folding will create wrinkles) but it hasn't been a problem for me to easily fix in post.My main use was to isolate subjects instead of using available backdrops in locations that may be too busy to mask out later. Works very well for that.. just keep in mind that there is no ""bottom"" to this - you won't get a seamless look because it ends at the floor, while traditional backdrops continue underneath the model. Would have been nice if there was an included few-feet of extra material for the subject to stand on to create a seamless experience, but this otherwise works great for anything above the feet.7 feet tall is a great height, it can also be used horiontally if needed for a wider size than 5 feet.Overall, really enjoying it.

"Picked this up to hold the Impact 5x7 foot backdrop.For that, it actually works well. Has a decent amount of opening to grip the backdrop (should have no problems with reflectors since most are smaller). Attached to the top of a lightstand (note: there is no 1/4"" or 3/8"" screw, so it won't work on a tripod).Does NOT swivel (meant to hold it with the opening on the bottom, so you can't angle a reflector), not a problem for me.I found it works best/easiest to attach the clip to the reflector/backdrop FIRST and then attach it to the lightstand.Quality is a bit iffy. Uses a firm plastic for the top piece, metal barrel for to attach to the lightstand and has a metal screw with a plastic handle.First issue, is you need to almost ENTIRELY unscrew the handle to attach it to a lightstand. Every time,  the screw fell to the ground. If on location, you can easily lose the screw. Other issue (based on experience with these same screws on other photo equipment) is that once you reach a certain point, the metal screw will actually tear through the plastic handle. Don't over-tighten  as it can destroy the screw handle also making it useless.With that said, it works and it works alright.Keep in mind this only grips the TOP of the reflector/backdrop. If wind hits it, it will still swing around (I recommend sandbagging a lightstad and possibly also have someone stand behind it to stabilize the backdrop/reflector to keep it from swaying.Overall, happy with it but not perfect","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5LZKNCZXV4VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3I6A8S#wasThisHelpful","R5LZKNCZXV4VM","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying that this review is based on a frequent ""sale"" price of about 25 bucks. Some sellers are offering this fan at 3x that price -- at 2x I'd still recommend it, but more than 40-50 is a bit too much.I own a large number of fans ranging from the cheap plastic table fans to large floor freestanding fans, and these. The reason for buying these were partly the low price, partly the style (which is a nice retro look) and partly because it's easy to clean (the others I own have no easy access to clean them)The fan is built very solid and has a nice metal finish. It comes in either Copper, Stainless steel and Gunmetal black. I would up with the Copper model due to it being the only one on sale and like the look (I was expecting it to look more ""copper"" than it actually is -- I prefer the color it actually is)It's got a sturdy base, blows a lot of air and has an oscillating mode along with 3 speeds (via turn-knob). I wasn't able to get the up-down swivel to work right, but haven't messed with it much since it's at a good position right now. Cord could be a little longer (I think it's maybe 5-6 feet?) which makes it a little short to put higher up.Quality of it overall is very high -- style is nice (I have a modern looking setup and was wondering how well a ""retro"" fan would work, but it looks surprisingly nice), air output is very good. Noise is perfectly fine for me (on high) but I know some people have a much lower tolerance for noise.I do wish it had a remote control like my other fans (might ruin the retro look of it though!).

"I tend to use Eneloop batteries and have had very good luck with them over the years -- I've tried the Energizer and Duracell rechargables which just didn't last nearly as long (despite being a ""Low Discharge"" battery like these) and have had the Energizer, Duracell and AmazonBasics (standard rechargables, not these) go ""bad"" on me and refuse to charge after about 6-12 months.These batteries are the newest ""High Capacity"" version of the low-self discharge batteries. Rechargables tend to come in either high capacity (but will drain fast when not in use) or low self discharge (lower capacity, but will last for years of non-use).These batteries try to mix the best of both worlds. You get a higher capacity (2400-2500mAH opposed to 1900-2000 mAH) while still having a long shelf-life of non-use (but not quite as long as the regular low-self-discharge, low capacity batteries).This is for those who tend to change batteries frequently -- an example is photographers changing batteries in flash units. For that, these are great.They're comparable to the ""Eneloop XX"" or ""Eneloop Pro"" batteries but at a fraction of the price. Using approximately 12 sets (48 AA) of these batteries, none have yet to show up as damaged (refusing to charge). Price is definitely a nice bonus (you can get 8 of these for what 4 of the Eneloop Pro's would cost), the downside is that the price is still more than any regular (1900-2000 mAH) rechargables would cost.If you need the extra power, these are great!

"Sprained my ankle about a month ago and tried to just manage. Did the rest, ice, compression and elevate, but it was still uncomfortable to walk. It began to get a little easier after a week and a half, but going up stairs or walking for periods of time still hurt. Planning to originally just ""sit it out"", I then gave in and bought this boot.I picked up a large for a size 11 shoe and it was perfect  (I'd say it would fit up to a size 12). Included are the soft inner liner, the hard plastic boot with velcro straps and some soft insert pads.Putting it together was very easy (it's all held together with velcro), the soft inserts (though small) really do make a difference for comfort.I use this boot part-time (take it off at home and for driving, wear it when I plan to walk around more than just in the house), so I use put it on and take it off once a day. The strength of the straps has held up for sure (even walking for 12+ hours a day) but some of the velcro (on the hard plastic boot) is attached with an adhesive which became a big mess after about a week (it still works, but the entire side of the boot is covered with this adhesive material.There is a blue ""pump"" button at the top to add air, which is nice, but I tend to not use it much anymore. If you want a more compressed feeling, it does do a good job though!The rubber bottom of the boot holds up very well, despite walking around for long periods of time on various environments.Most importantly, I can easily walk with this for hours.

"I purchased this after getting the Ez-Pro 60"" Softbox -- the quality was very impressive and ease of use was a huge seller for me. Looking for something of similar quality, I picked up the 12x56 softbox and eggcrate grid.The ""EZ PRO"" is the important part to look for in their products as they assemble very easily, much like an umbrella. The ribs are very sturdy (fiberglass), much stronger than any umbrella I've ever used. I wouldn't recommend tossing it around, but I don't see it breaking as easy as an umbrella would.The mount is easily swapped out with a screwdriver - great if you own multiple types of lights (AlienBee and Bowens, for example)I'm using this with a speedlight and a Bowens adapter with great results.The stripbox unfolds in a matter of seconds, from there you attach 2 diffusion covers (the inner one can be left attached even when disassembled and in a big), the outer cover attaches very quickly via velcro and makes a nice tight fit (some softboxes have an issue of a 'drooping' cover). There's also a silver dish that connects to spread the light out across the long length of the box.The size is a bit odd (12x56) but that's the point of a stripbox. I would have liked to see the 12x80 inch offered in the NON ez-pro line, but this is as big as I've found.The light folds down and fits into an included bag (the bag is admittedly low quality, but it works). The item, in the bag, dos take up quite a bit of room (much moreso than a simple umbrella), though not as much as the 60"" EZ-ProQuality is high -- fiberglass and metal with a good fabric. However, the quality doesn't seem to match up to the 60"" octabox (and I'm not sure why, really).

I purchased the grid and while it is very fragile (be VERY careful when removing it or it will tear), it does work great.

"I've used plenty of lighting solutions over the years and have always been looking for ""the next best thing""Starting with Umbrellas (white shoot-thru and black/silver reflective), I was never totally happy with the light. It worked in a pinch, it was inexpensive, but never gave me anything special in terms of lighting. I quickly moved to the Phottix Softlighter II and loved it -- this was a reflective umbrella with a softbox cover on it. It gave a nice, large light source but the downfalls were the setup process (having to attach the cover to each spoke of the light) and the fragile nature of the umbrella. One fall and the umbrella was toast (which didn't take long)Seeing the Fotodiox lights, I was interested. The ""EZ PRO"" is the important part to look for in their products as they assemble very easily, much like an umbrella. The ribs are very sturdy (fiberglass), much stronger than any umbrella I've ever used. I wouldn't recommend tossing it around, but I don't see it breaking as easy as an umbrella would.The mount is easily swapped out with a screwdriver - great if you own multiple types of lights (AlienBee and Bowens, for example)I'm using this with a speedlight and a Bowens adapter with great results.The softbox unfolds in a matter of seconds, from there you attach 2 diffusion covers (the inner one can be left attached even when disassembled and in a big), the outer cover attaches very quickly via velcro and makes a nice tight fit (some softboxes have an issue of a 'drooping' cover)The size is VERY large -- I bought the 60"" one (upgrading from a 46"" Softlighter) and the difference is noticeable. With that said, no regrets at all. I love this light.The light folds down and fits into an included bag (the bag is admittedly low quality, but it works). The item, in the bag, dos take up quite a bit of room (much moreso than a simple umbrella), this is closer to a golf-bag size.Quality is high -- fiberglass and metal with a good fabric.One thing to note is that the eggcrate grid is NOT included and is very costly by itself. I purchased the grid and while it is very fragile (be VERY careful when removing it or it will tear), it does work great. Definitely not up to the quality of the softbox, but a useful accessory if you use grids - check the item page for that for my review.Overall, highly recommended - already looking into buying a 2nd!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HT05ZRXXQX8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EWOC2I#wasThisHelpful","R3HT05ZRXXQX8H","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is basically an 8.8 LB brick with a Superclamp attached to it. It's a nice alternative to sandbags and works great on lightstands and boom arms.The package arrives un-assembled and without directions (the orange brick, a spring, a washer and the handle) - the handle/screw/washer all screw into the weight easy and without the need for any tools.The item works fairly simple -- loosen the arm to widen the clamp, attach to a boom arm and tighten down. The big benefits here are the size (fairly small for the weight it has -- something that would likely take a much larger sandbag), the solid shape and the ability to superclamp it onto your boom arm and adjust the positioning (higher or lower on the arm).The downside compared to a sandbag is that you're stuck at 8.8 LBs. With a (non-sealed) sandbag you can easily adjust the weight as needed, with this you're stuck at a solid weight (which may be more than you need). Manfrotto makes these in 3lb, 10lb and 15lb, however the price of this 8.8lb calumet one is less than the Manfrotto 3lb. would cost (and still a high quality).A really nice benefit is the ability to clamp it onto a lightstand -- if you've used a lightstand with an umbrella, you know they can fall over very easily in the wind. Attaching some of these weights to the lightstand (either to the legs directly or to the center column) can hold it down and prevent the stand from tipping in the wind and possibly damaging your light. I've used 2 of these to hold down a 60"" umbrella in the wind without problems. With that said, if the wind is blowing hard enough, this may keep the stand from tipping but a weaker umbrella may snap from the force of the wind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZZ0D4R4D7LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GC22X4#wasThisHelpful","R35ZZ0D4R4D7LX","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is mostly to respond to some of the previous reviews/comments made on the product. This was purchased in June 2015 (in case they have made any changes since the earlier production)Right off the bat, this thing IS overpriced. It's almost the same price as the softbox itself and the softbox is MUCH higher quality.Essentially you get a foldable eggcrate/grid for the 12x56 softbox made of poor materials. The eggcrate comes in a very portable (nice!) bag measuring about 1 foot by about 5 inches.. it folds up very compact and travels in this pouch easily.To attach it, simply remove it form the bag and unfold it to display the giant rectangle shape.. it attaches to the 12x56 softbox with a small strip of velcro. It attaches to the ""end"" part of the softbox (those saying it's too big or too small may be attaching it to the wrong part.. mine did indeed fit perfectly without any extra room and without any sagging from too much room).As mentioned, the quality is poor. It's essentially a strip of velcro (1 for each side) and the grid itself is made of a somewhat thin vinyl material (think a throwaway tablecloth from a picnic. It's better than paper, but not by much)If used indoors, it should last. The most likely ways it will break are: using it outdoors in heavy wind (the material is so thin, I can see the wind tearing it if it catches it) and removing it. The problem is instead of one long rectangle shape of velcro, it's 4 straight-pieces of velcro (one for each side) all attached by the thin vinyl material. This means if you try to pull it off all at once you'll stretch the vinyl and tear it. The natural instinct is to pull the velcro off completely in one-go, but with this you need to remove each piece one at a time. Doing this will likely make the product last.Overall, it's overpriced. The quality is bad.. but there are no other options and it works. For that, I have to give it 4 stars for those that need it. If there were another option, I would say go with that, but there isn't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XF9WGNZ9KWZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EWU0MY#wasThisHelpful","R1XF9WGNZ9KWZY","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually a pretty nice flash bounce. I've made these out of craft foam before and they work good in situations where you need a bright, spread out fill light in a specific direction and don't have much to bounce off of.. but don't have time to set up a separate lightstand.There are essentially 2 pieces: The diffuser/reflector and the strap.Right off the bat, the strap is pretty much garbage. It's too small and too fragile. If you use it (and can get it to fit your flash) the odds are high that you'll find that the diffuser is missing not too much later. If at all possible, I recommend not using it.Fortunately, it is easy to fix. I use 2x velcro cable ties (they usually sell for a few bucks as a 50- or 100- pack), doing this gives extra room and a higher amount of velcro to grip onto.Another option is to line the inside of the diffuser with Velcro and attach the opposite side onto the flash itself OR use a separate accessory like a 'Honl Speedstrap"" which wraps around the flash and easily removes. Both will give a much more secure fit (the speedstrap will prevent you from needing to put velcro on the flash itself.The diffuser itself is ""OK"" in terms of quality. It feels like a cardboard wrapped in a vinyl type of finish. I was expecting a bit more, but overall I think it will be fine.. especially for the price.The diffuser folds flat and locks together using 2 buttons on the back.The way the diffuser works is that the flash fires upwards into the diffuser to light up the inside of it, and ""scoop"" that larger light source towards your subject providing a (slightly better) light - both in terms of size and diffusion. Larger light = softer (and more background fill).The suggested way of attaching it is not my preference -- I prefer to turn the flash head sideways and attach this item to one of the short ends (still facing forward) which will give extra flexibility (turning the head) in portrait mode so that the flash is always at the top. See photo attached as example.NOTE: The reflector is not transparent at all -- flash will not bounce through it. The full power will go up and forward (the angle of the ""scoop""). By unbuttoning the flash, and the card being used flat (no ""scoop"") you can use it as a fill flash  + bounce (flash will go upwards to bounce off a ceiling, and forward towards your subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6CHYAA6UCOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DXHWOBK#wasThisHelpful","RR6CHYAA6UCOQ","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When using studio lights raised higher-up (and in close) you can sometimes have issues with the lower half of people (feet/legs) being darker on full-length portraits. In most areas you can move your lights, but in a small studio it can be a problem.I picked up this box to help fix that problem.. and it worked surprisingly well!There are NO INSTRUCTIONS and there appear to be missing pieces at first.. be sure to look at the product photos on here to see how it goes together. The item ships with a bunch of metal bars and the ""softbox"" folded into a small reflector-style circle case. Very compact!The metal bars assemble to form an ""H"" shape and have plastic clips on the 2 top and 2 bottom bars to hold the softbox open.Remove the softbox from the case and use the ""H"" to prop it open.It has a bar to attach a studio strobe.. but if you're using speedlights it will work also (but you'll need to find your own mount. I use a Manfrotto 026) The bottom of the inside is coated in silver, so pointing the flash down will reflect it upwards through the transparent diffuser sheet.It's very easy to use, just place in front of your model and adjust the light as needed. Getting inside to the flash is easy (and it closes with a pull-string) and setup/teardown takes less than 15-20 seconds.It holds its shape very well and seems to be made with high quality (especially for the price). I haven't seen any others like this, especially in this price, so it's a nice little purchase.One thing I will mention is to keep an eye on your models' face in photos -- if the power of this is up too high, it will create a weird ""lighting from below"" where the bottom of their face has spillage from this light which looks weird. In most cases it's not a problem, but keep an eye out for it if you're upping the power.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPS46UOFT8DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054EMDFW#wasThisHelpful","R2UPS46UOFT8DG","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the reviews before ordering this. I don't think anyone praised it for being high-quality (or even ""decent quality"") but still wanted to give it a chance because I was wanting a grid for the 60"" Ez-Pro Octabox.Due to the shape and size of the Octabox, I haven't found any other compatible grids. That means you're stuck with this one (or nothing)The grid comes in a small carrying pouch (which was unexpected and a nice touch). Immediately when opening it, you can tell the grid is fairly flimsy. A lot of people say it feels like paper, and they're not wrong about that. It's not actually paper, it seems like a very, very thin layer of vinyl but it will definitely rip/tear without much effort so be careful. For the price, you definitely expect more (especially considering the value that the Ez-Pro softbox itself is)There are essentially 8 ""sides"" (flat strips around the edges) with a gap separating them.. this allows you to attach each to one side of the softbox. It actually works really well, but the downside is when removing the grid it's VERY EASY to tear the grid. The key is to remove each strip one at a time and not ""pull"" it at all like you would be inclined to.The grid connects to the softbox with velcro - the strips are about 1 1/2 - 2 inches wide but the velcro part is very small (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 inches).So why 4 stars? It works, it's the only option out there and once in place the quality is better. What I mean by that is that the grid makes a very nice fit.. a lot of 3rd party manufacturers of photo equipment (looking at you Cowboy Studios and ePhotoinc!)  don't have the best fit. A cover might be too oversized and droop, or too tight to attach without fighting it.. this one went on easy and was the perfect fit. I was kind of surprised with it after the initial impressions. There was no sagging and it functioned just as well as I would have liked (and better than expected). It's unfortunate that the quality is so low as I would otherwise highly recommend them. As-is, I don't know if i'd trust it outdoors and even indoors you need to be really careful with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROX7D0THS0BC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EWQ802#wasThisHelpful","ROX7D0THS0BC1","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT: This review is written on the original price of about 120 bucks (sold by amazon) -- 3rd party sellers are selling this lens for much more, and at that price it becomes similar in price to the Canon version of the lens.(I own and use a wide range of lenses, mostly faster primes (f1.4), some ""L"" lenses and some zooms ranging from the entry-level to the mid-range)I've been using Yongnuo products for a few years and have been generally happy with them.. They've been making speedlights for several years and started off a bit iffy but quickly brought up the quality. With the YN35mm f2 being their 2nd lens, I was honestly not expecting much.Tried this one on both a full-frame and crop-sensor camera for the results below.* BUILD QUALITY * : The lens is mostly plastic but has a metal mount. It feels a bit higher quality than the canon 50mm 1.8 but not by much. The lens does not have the distance marker scale that the Canon 35mm f2 has, but otherwise I'm not very familiar with that lens.* ACCESSORIES / BUTTONS * The lens does include a front and rear cap (the lens cap being a nice E-52II comparable cap). Uses 52mm threading for filters.The side has an AF/MF switch for going between modesFrom what I can tell, there is no attachment for a lens-hood. You'll need to buy a threaded (52mm) hood if you want to attach one to this lens. The lens does extend while focusing but the barrel does not rotate.IMPORTANT: For some reason, yongnuo puts a protective cover over the front and rear elements glass of the lens -- be sure to remove these stickers before use.* FOCUSING/NOISE * : The lens does make a loud mechanical noise while zooming, almost identical to the 50mm 1.8 Canon lens. If you're shooting video, you will hear it (noise is fairly loud in both autofocus and manual)The focusing works if you don't need super fast focusing (spots). It doesn't seem to hunt, it's just slow.Focusing is accurate, though, and taking 15 test shots (setting lens to infinity each time and focusing at different distances from minimum (.25m/.8ft) to maximum), all 15 were accurate* COMPATABILITY * : The lens works on both APS (full-frame) and APS-C (1.6x crop) sensors with an EF or EF-S mount.* EXIF DATA * : Lens displays as ""35mm F2"" (no maker) in EXIF data.. Serial # shows as 00000000.  Other data is shown (such as aperture -- some 3rd party lenses will not display this, or will display the lens as a ""50mm"" with no additional data regardless of focal length and aperture). I've heard that some peoples' YN35's will display as a Sigma 24-xx zoom lens, so they may have changed this since the first batch.* CLARITY/SHARPNESS * : Surprisingly.. the lens is sharp!I originally tested at F2, expecting some issues, and it performed very well. Clarity was there (even at 100% crop), colors were nice, sharpness was high and the out of focus elements were really nice and smooth looking (some lenses product an ugly out of focus/bokeh area).Moving up to f/2.8 the lens got quite a bit sharper. I would consider it very usable at even f2, but will probably keep it at f2.8 for portraits and to ensure sharp focus.Color fringing was noticeable on a few shots with a high contrast but wasn't bad (lightroom fixed it up quickly), and nowhere near as bad as something like the Canon 85mm 1.8.* PROBLEMS * : For some reason, the lens would not focus properly in live view. I don't know why this is -- it will ""hunt"" for focus, it will lock in but every time it was very obviously out of focus. I don't know if this is an issue with the camera itself or this particular lens (all other lenses tested had no issues focusing in live-view)Unfortunately I don't have a Canon 35mm f2 to compare it to, but I'm more than happy with this one and would buy another Yongnuo lens without hesitation assuming this one holds up over time.* OVERALL * : Highly recommended, especially if you're wanting a lens a bit wider and faster than the 40mm 2.8 or something to go alongside a 50mm 1.4/1.8","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFCTSZQOI95LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4Z82ZO#wasThisHelpful","RFCTSZQOI95LH","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using the Spyder Express for a few years and have generally been dissatisfied with it. After dealing with odd issues with earlier versions (only designed for 32-bit OS's, crashing profiles, single-monitor calibration, etc..) I wanted something a bit more advanced.During a recent sale I picked up the i1Display Pro 3 (EODIS3).The box includes the USB device, a CD-Rom with the software (download it directly from X-Rite instead.. they have the most up to date version) and a quick-install manual.The USB device has a very plastic'y feel, the dust-cover doesn't seem like something that would protect it too much and the USB cable is very thin (a bit worrying since you hang this on your monitor by the USB cable)Software install is very basic (only 1 install, not multiple like some other calibration tools). It's a bit odd in that it only launches in ""DEMO"" mode until you plug the i1Display into it (then it unlocks the full version)My uses were to calibrate 3 monitors (LED) for photo editing. I rarely print, so webviewing was my main goal here.There are 2 modes: Basic and Advanced, and they're pretty much what they sound like. Unfortunately, even Basic was a bit ""advanced"" if you don't know the luminance, color temperature, etc.. that you want (the standard seems to be 120cd/m2 and D65, so I went with those). Without any real instruction, it will easily confuse some users (and keep in mind, this is the basic mode)From there, you go into calibration mode/measuring mode. Place the device on your monitor (you need to tilt your monitor back so the device sits flush on it.. all 3 of my monitors do not tilt backwards, so I actually had to prop them up with something underneath the front.From there, it will either auto-adjust your contrast/brightness (if it has ADC built in) or ask you to do so. What was nice is that it tells you where it's at. EX: 140 (and you want 120). As you adjust it, it tells you how close you are and will eventually give you a green check-mark when everything is good. After that it will flash through a series of colors (approx 2 minutes on basic mode) and then ask to save your profile.In advanced mode, there are many additional options (including an extended large-pallette of colors which takes about 7 minutes to calibrate). You can also view just how close it is (EX you want 6500k and it measured as 6,548k.. you wanted 120cd/m2, it measured 119cdm/2) which is nice.I found my current calibration was already very close, but the brightness was up way too high (around 180, opposed to 120) on all 3 displays. The other changes made by the software seemed to be very minimal, but it did quickly calibrate all 3 monitors.My only complaints:I had this crash my Surface Pro when trying to calibrate with ADC turned on (crashed every time.. worked fine with it off)Crashed an nvidia app (PC) the first time running it.. worked fine after that thoughDefault profile was a v4 profile (which messed up colors in non-supported apps, such as windows photo viewer.. had to re-calibrate with a v2 profile)USB cable seems a bit weak, item is very plastic'y (despite high cost)Other than that, it ran fast and looks good so far.

"I just upgraded from a 7-port USB 2.0 hub to this 3.0 one. Looking around, almost all 3.0 hubs seemed to have issues, this one seemed to ""last"" a bit higher than the AmazonBasics model and was the same price.The hub has a decent sized (3 foot?) USB cable along with a port cable (it uses the standard sized plug with a ""brick"" in the middle of the plug, opposed to a brick on the power-plug end (which can sometimes  limit the amount of AC outputs you can use - a nice touch here)The hub itself is a decent size and weight.

Not sure what that means.It looks like 2 inputs (the far left and right) are a constantly--powered one, so you can plug an iPad, Phone or other USB device in to charge them while the computer is off (un-tested)Unfortunately, on arrival 1 port was only recognized as USB 2.0. I tried 3 drives and 2 cables, all only showed as USB 2.0 connections. All others were USB 3.0..I emailed the manufacturer (when you buy from Plugable/fulfilled by Amazon they send you an email after purchase with contact info), and they offered to send a replacement free of charge (without sending mine back first) which was nice. Most companies require you to send the item back and wait for it to be repaired.. that didn't seem to be the case here.

"Bio-Dome's been a long time favorite of mine.. had to get the Blu-Ray.The disc contains only the movie (no special features) - the video is pretty good (the first 5-minutes look awful, but once the movie actually starts it's better than I expected.

A good amount of grain, but the picture is sharp.Audio, on the other hand, is only in DTS 2.0 (the DVD from 13 years ago even had a 5.1 track)This could be forgiven, but the high price on this release makes it a bit iffy -- the movie looks great, sounds ""good"" for most of it (the beginning was really bad - sounded much better on the DVD).If you're a fan of the movie, it's an upgrade (visually) over the DVD","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO4H3HRGZPC00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQGGJVS#wasThisHelpful","RO4H3HRGZPC00","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying I own a lot of the pricier modifiers -- westcott, lastolite, phottix, etc..I've tried some of the 3rd party stuff and have generally been disappointed (""saggy"" diffusers, poor quality product, etc..)After receiving this Neewer 28x28"" softbox, I immediately ordered a 2nd one.With that said, there are a few issues.Setup time is super-quick. Literally 30 seconds from bag to set up is possible. The main part of the softbox is an umbrella (no weird metal frames to assemble) and once it's setup you attach it to a lightstand (zipper hole on the bottom) and throw the velcro diffuser on it. Love it.Diffuser quality is nice -- a double-diffusion would have been nice, but the quality is definitely there. Umbrella also seems to be strongly re-inforced.The bottom has a double-zipper for the lightstand to go through. You'll need an umbrella swivel for your lightstand to hold this -- I recommend the ""Full aluminum OM-18 Pro"" which has become a favorite over even the Manfrotto swivel.The 2 problems here are: There isn't much working room. You want to aim the flash at the back of the umbrella for it to light evenly. Unless you keep it angled, it's somewhat too small to fit in there (even without a hotshoe receiver) unless you stand it up straight and point it towards the back. I prefer to adjust the actual flash to fire right into the back, not at an angle.Another issue is if you're using a manual-powered speedlight, it's a bit tricky to get inside the diffuser to adjust it (fortunately the velcro helps). I recommend flashes which can be controlled wirelessly from the camera (like a Yongnuo YN560III/IV)Lastly, it's not the best for angles. You can only tilt it so much before it gets stuck. There just isn't as much flexibility because the lightstand has to go through the bottom of it. The only solution I found was to put a swivel umbrella on the lightstand, put a short lightstand extension stick on that, put another swivel on the extension and put the softbox through there. Not an ideal (or cheap solution). As long as you're not trying to point the softbox down (without a boom arm) you'll be fine.. but don't expect the flexibility of an umbrella.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JP8MQQTP8YI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BQ233C#wasThisHelpful","R3JP8MQQTP8YI4","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm relatively new to airbrushes, so I'm not terribly familiar with the different hose sizes, types and materials -- I've been using the 6-foot hose included with the Paasche Talon airbrush and it's been working fine.. until I snapped it.Needing a replacement, and the 10-foot hose of the same type being only about a buck more, I went for this one.Right off the bat, the hose LOOKS the same - it's a high quality braided air hose. Connectors are the same (it will fit the Talon airbrush - not sure about others). Like the 6-foot hose, I did need an adapter to plug it into the air compressor I use (TC-20T air compressor -- if you did not need one with the 6-foot hose, you won't need one for this. I imagine it's more that my compressor has a non-standard sized outlet -- no deduction, just a heads-up!)The hose length is nice -- 10 feet is a nice improvement over the 6 foot version if you need a little more space. I didn't have any leaks in mine (something a few reviews have noted, so do check yours if you order one!)I did notice that the side that connects to the air compressor IS different than the one on the 6-foot hose. The 6-foot one seems to have some better sealing/rubber O-Rings, while the 10-foot version seems to rely more on friction and holding it against the compressor. I had no leaks when tightened, so it does seem to work, but just another change that could cause some issues down the road.In the end, it's a nice size and works nicely!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTC4OVEA3OIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004O7F352#wasThisHelpful","R2QTC4OVEA3OIA","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this product a few years back at a photo expo.. tried it.. and loved it!It's a full replacement eyecup. You start by removing the original eyepiece on the camera (in this case, the 6D -- very easy to do), replace the eyepiece with this and you're done. Snaps in place, no tools/disassembly required.The eyepiece itself is a circle and has this rubber eyecup going around it (since it's a circle, the rubber piece moves anywhere you want it to be (left side, right side, point up) which is very nice. The biggest benefit is that it blocks out stray light so youre ONLY seeing the viewfinder. I heard it won't work with the overly large glasses, but it's worked on every pair I've owned (enough to buy 4 of these!)Now, the downsides:It's rubber. Rubber doesn't last forever. I've had about 3 or 4 of these tear on me (and once it tears, it's pretty much done for). This does seem to have been fixed (or improved) though.. I havent had any tear in about 3 years now.It's bulky. It will prevent you from setting the camera down on the back (unless you fold the eyecup into itself)It's big. This will block the (top) of the LCD. I havent found it to be too big of a problem, but it will get in the way (especially if you're trying to use liveview or show people pictures on the screen. It folds up easily enough, but it is a bit of an oddity you dont always think of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GINCTQD0ZX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GK9OJC#wasThisHelpful","R14GINCTQD0ZX9","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago, Delkin Devices released a product called the ImageRouter - it was one long strip with 4 CF readers built in.. the idea is after a long day of shooting (multiple cards or multiple cameras) you can go home and download everything at once.It's a great idea, and with Delkin discontinuing the ImageRouter (and the switch most manufacturers made to SD) I've been wanting something like it.I think they did some things right, but others I just have to ask ""why?"" to.Here's how the system works:You buy the HR1 (the base), buy the modules you want (CF, SD, etc..) and then just plug them into the base. The base holds up to 4 of these readers.Easy enough? I like the idea that you can mix & match.. 2 SD, 2 CF, etc..Unfortunately, and this is where my problems begin, the HR1 base is expensive! 50 to 75 bucks.. for the cardreader holder alone. No card-readers included (the picture is a bit misleading)Each CF/SD reader ranges from about 25 to 35 bucks (so do the math on the base + 4 readers.. it adds up!)I made the leap, and here are my thoughts:First, it's a luxory item. You don't NEED 4 CF readers.. but it's nice to have!You can also buy 4 cheaper readers and use those just fine.. this just looks nicer.1 reader per module. Problem here is, you can buy a good USB 3.0 reader that will read all the card types for pretty cheap, and about the same size as each module. Considering how bulky these are, they could've added more to each module (especially the ones like the SD reader)The base is pretty heavy, but I can almost guarantee its fake weight (unnecessary weight to give it a stronger and heavier feel). I'm sure the readers are also quite empty.. which begs the question, why so big? At about 6x5x5 inches, it's pretty bulky. I don't mind this as much as I have the space, but others can have issues with it.Next up, there is a constant bright blue LED on it -- each reader has its own LED, but the base also has one.The lights on the individual readers light up when in use, but the main base is always lit.SIDENOTE: I do like that the individual drives light up when in use (it lets you know when it's ready (solid), in use (blinking) and acts as a reminder that ""Your memory card is still in here.. you might wanna take it with you"")Another complaint: It requires power!Each reader can work by itself with just a USB cable.. but to use the base you need to plug in an AC power cable.  The power plug is also very bulky (a ""wall wart"") which can be trouble finding space for.A nice feature: You can always mix & match the trays. Shooting mostly SD cards? load it up with SD trays. Shooting CF? load it up with CF trays. Both? do half and half. Of course, each does have a cost attached to it.The included USB cable is a decent length, but not really long enough for my liking (I'd say maybe 3 feet?), meaning if you plan to have your computer on the ground and the card reader on the opposite side of the desk, you're out of luck without buying an extension.The readers have a USB 3.0 port on the back (thats it) and the base has a male USB connector -- the base basically works as a hub for these, so you'll get the same results out of just plugging 4 of these into a computer.The nice thing is each reader can be used standalone: Take it on the go, with your laptop, etc.. and no issues. Note that the individual readers do not require power (only when in the base)The readers attach firmly -- I'm able to insert/remove CF cards (which are normally a tight fit) without it pulling the trays out.Each tray also has a cover to protect it from dust when not in use.Overall: Works nice, I like it! But just so many issues.. it just seems like they're trying to get your money in as many ways as they can from it, not really doing you any favors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JE69QNIKIL6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ8CKRU#wasThisHelpful","R3JE69QNIKIL6V","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying until now, I've only purchased the official CANON battery grips for every DSLR I had (3 prior to the 6D). With the cost of these being 5x what the 3rd party ones sell for, I decided to chance it.I was very pleased in how nice the grip feels. I can't compare it to the official Canon version, but it seems to work just as well (and feel nice) like my XTi/40D/7D canon grips.The benefit of the battery grip is:* Holds 2x batteries (lets you shoot twice as long!)* Includes 6x AA tray (so if you run out of batteries you can run the DSLR on AA batteries (only recommended if absolutely no other option)* Gives shutter controls (dial, shutter button, AF point button, etc..) in vertical mode (much more comfortable!)* Adds a nice rubber grip to the DSLR for vertical shooting* Adds size to the DSLR (for those that like it)The battery grip connects into the battery slot -- remove the battery cover (it stores in the grip so if you choose to go back, you still have it).The screw-in connector works, but is a bit loose (won't undo itself, but has a bit of play -- this is the same as on Canons battery grips)The rubber grip is slightly different than the grip on the 6D itself (a bit smoother, not as rough). Both work fine for me (no preference)Overall.. very nice grip, 1/5 the cost.. works great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11E4ZHU1GEIES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOQ1LOA#wasThisHelpful","R11E4ZHU1GEIES","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It doesn't feel quite as nice as the original hood but the shape does match.. there are a few small details different (like a textured ring around the bottom of the hood).

"Coldshoe's have always been a big iffy to me -- most of them use 2 pieces of metal to grip onto the side of the flash foot, tighten down and hold it in place with friction. They seem to work, but it's a lot of weight/pressure to put on a flash foot and any sudden movement (moving the lightstand or lowering it quickly) could cause it to fall off.. and flashes aren't cheap.Because of this, I've always been hesitant of using them. The Frio changed that with its design -The frio is a thick plastic and has several pieces in place to hold the flash and not put too much pressure on it. There's a special slot that it locks into (designed to encase the flash foot) to prevent it from falling out.. it has a ""protector"" bump right behind the flash foot to prevent it from sliding out and it has a locking pin hole so you can tighten the flash into it.NOTE: Some flashes like the Canon 580EXII have a rubber-sealed locking mechanism.. I don't know if these will work on the frio.The overall feel is much nicer than something like the stroboframe and I haven't had issues with it. The bottom has a 3/8"" and 1/4"" metal mount to attach to a tripod or lightstand.The downsides of it:It's only available in this weird blue color. I don't know why they couldn't make it black.. but it's a small gripe.The flash can be somewhat tricky to put on (and take off) due to the rear-bumper (you need to press it down to get the flash in or out). I've tried putting the flash on, thought it was on and almost let go.They sell these in a few packs -- 1 pack, 3 pack, 5 pack.. each one gives a better discount, so if you need these look into the different pack sizes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33X1Y7FS96DP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRF3J6S#wasThisHelpful","R33X1Y7FS96DP5","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a longtime DSLR user (CompactFlash), so going from the high-speed cards (100+mb/sec) to the somewhat slower cards has been a big change. With the prices dramatically jumping (from 40mb/sec to 60mb/sec to 80-90mb/sec), I purchased a few of each.The 60MB/Sec card seems to be a good speed -- it definitely feels faster than the 40MB/sec card (about 50% faster) but noticeably slower than the 80-90MB/sec cards.You probably won't notice much of a difference when shooting (most cameras wont write to the card at this full speed) but you will notice it when downloading pictures to your computer. If you shoot only a couple GB at a time, I wouldn't spend too much more for the faster speeds but if you're shooting 10+ GB you'll want the faster speed.The price jump from the 60MB/sec to the 80-90-95 MB/sec cards is quite a bit, so I can't really recommend that.. but the jump from the 40MB/sec cards to the 60MB/sec cards is only a few bucks and you'll appreciate it.

"I've been a big fan of the ThinkTank ""holders"" -- the DSLR battery holder (this), the AA holder, the CF/SD holders and the Gel holders..The problem with the DSLR batter holder (available in a 2x or 4x size) is that it's not specific. It's more of a ""One size fits.. Most?"" design. I say this because some batteries fit great some fit very loose, some fit 2x in each side and some don't fit at all.If you're using one of the somewhat big batteries (Canon 7D, 5D, 40D) it should fit fine.. If you have a smaller battery (Rebel XTi) it'll fit, but be a bit loose in the holder. If you're using a small battery (EOS-M/Mirrorless) it will fit 2 in each side. If you're using a big battery, however, it may not fit at all.For me, mine did fit so I give it 5 stars. For others, it may be a problem.The pouch doesn't add much bulk, keeps the batteries protected (it has a flap w/ velcro to seal it). I typically put my batteries in ""contact-side down"" to indicate NEW and ""contact-side-up"" to indicate used.I like the 4x battery pack if using multiple cameras, but the 2x is also nice for short trips.I do wish it had one of the safety-straps like their other holder/wallets do (to clip it into a bag and not have it come out on you)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5ASEABDG4SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TIYYQ2#wasThisHelpful","R2U5ASEABDG4SL","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying I love Eneloop Batteries. I've been using them for about 5 years now (since the earlier models), mostly for photography (flashes) but also for other items (Xbox controller, wireless transmitters, etc..)The big feature of Eneloop are that they hold the charge - some batteries, you charge them, let them sit for a couple months and they're totally dead when you go to use it (this also applies to putting them into devices, like a flash or remote control -- after a couple months, they're dead.With Eneloop, it holds the charge -- and for quite a while! (years). The downside is that you get a lower capacity (you can get a 2700 mAH battery that will last 2 months or a 2000 mAH battery that will last over 5 years without needing a recharge).If you plan to use these in high-drain devices where you use the entire battery in one day, you probably won't notice the full benefits of these batteries.Eneloop released their Eneloop XX line a couple years ago (now knows as Eneloop Pro). They have a higher capacity (about 25% more) with the slow-discharge rate (but faster than regular eneloops). These for are when you want ""the best of both worlds"".. higher capacity AND longer lasting.The differences:Eneloop (white): 1900-2000 mAH, can be recharged 2100 times. About 10 bucks for a 4-packEneloop Pro (black): 2450-2550 mAH, can be recharged up to 500 times. About 20 bucks for a 4-pack (Look for sales! I got mine for about 13 bucks on Amazon)The white ones will hold 70% of the charge after 5 years. The Pro's hold up to 85% after 1 year (so not quite as good).The 500 recharges vs 2100 recharges doesn't do much for me.. In the 5 years I've had the eneloops, I'd be surprised if I recharged each set more than 100 times (and thats using them regularly)The more important thing is the extra power.. is 25% power worth an almost 100% premium in price (non-sale?) And that all depends on the person.For me, in a day of photography I would go through a full set of Eneloop (regular) and finish up with a 2nd set.. that 25% extra capacity would normally save me from needing the 2nd set.. but everyone is different. If you need more than that extra 25%, you're probably better off getting 2 sets of the regular eneloops' since you'll be changing them anyways.I had some problems with the earlier Eneloop XX, but those seem to be resolved with the new Eneloop Pro's (so I'm glad I gave them a 2nd chance). I have tried the AmazonBasics batteries and they just didn't seem to work as well as the Eneloops. I also picked up several Duracell and Energizer AA batteries and both encountered charging errors just a few months after owning.In the end, for me it comes down to the price.. a 25-50% premium (for 25% extra power) is worth it for me.. but if it were to be the typical 100% premium price for that 25% extra power, I would have passed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUT3IYVUIUY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FRE84W#wasThisHelpful","R1LUT3IYVUIUY4","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'l start off by saying I've been using the Manfrotto Tilt-Swivel for a few years and love it.. everything about it is great, except the price. As of this review, the price has gone up about 33% (3x the price of this item), and needing 3 more of these I didn't want to spend that much.I've start off by saying I have used several other tilt-swivels with mixed results. I've never been totally happy with them.. the closest one has been the Calumet swivel (about 2/3 the price of the Manfrotto)Let me also say to just avoid the plastic ones.. I've tried 3 over the years and all have been bad.On to this product:Off the bat, it's solid. Seems to be mostly metal (the screw knobs seem to be plastic)You get a total of 4 pieces:* The swivel itself* a Coldshoe (metal)* A Male-Male spigot (1/4"" - 3/8"")* A female-female spigot (1/4"" - 3/8"")This combination lets you attach to either a lightstand or tripod, and mount a flash, camera or other accesory on top.There are 3 sections to the swivel (black/white/black) which is different from the usual 2 that these have.. the benefit is that you can attach the bottom end to a lightstand, tilt the middle section (umbrella holder) to the desired angle) and then with a flash on the top piece, tilt it to point directly into the umbrella (a big problem with other ones are that the flash sits way too high, so it's hard to fill the umbrella.. you get hot spots on the top and darker on the bottom).. This is actually a really cool design!There are 5 knobs on the swivel:2 metal (to lock the spigot/lightstand), 2 plastic (to adjust the angle) and 1 small metal (to hold the umbrella in place.Unfortunately, these were a little too close together for me.. you can even see it in the picture but some of them are REALLY close together and can be a bit difficult to tighten/loosen, but overall I was able to do it fine.. just felt a little ""tight""The spigots seem fine, but not the same quality as the brass ones Manfrotto sells (I dont expect any problems)The coldshoe seems fine, but I use a Frio v2 Coldshoe instead (which works great!)Lastly, the 2 swiveling sections have ""teeth"" on each end to lock tightly in place. This is great since others that use friction to hold together do tend to droop down under weight. The teeth will hold it firmly in place.Overall.. the price I paid (1/3 of a manfrotto swivel), it works great. I love the 3rd section. No regrets on buying this over the Manfrotto.As of this review (3 days after ordering), the price has gone up to about 1/2 of the Manfrotto swivel","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13P2Z4E7UJK4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLOLFTS#wasThisHelpful","R13P2Z4E7UJK4B","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying I've owned 10+ R-Straps.. Several RS-4's, an RS-5, 2 RS Dual-Straps and now 2 Cross Shots.One of my biggest gripes with the RS4 and RS-5 are that they could slip. I constantly found my shoulder strap ""slipping"" forward with use, and it got pretty annoying. Seeing the rubber grip on the Cross Shot had me give it a chance.My initial concern: Ugly orange! (the Cross Shot was originally only sold in Orange.. it's not in black, thanksfull!), next up: It's the cheapest R-Strap and has extra features.. whats wrong with it? And finally, the quick release clip on the back.Fortunately, none of these were a problem!The Cross Shot uses a molded rubber grip over the strap (in place of the previous fabric shoulder pieces). I was expecting a solid fabric strap with a sliding rubber sheath over it, but it's actually molded on top of the strap. I do wonder how long it will hold up for with repeated use, but so far no issues.The rubber works! It gives a nice grip on your shoulder so as not to slide around.The Cross Shot includes a free Lockstar connector (an added safety feature, usually sold separately)The cross shot folds up nice and compact (unfortunately, unlike my other straps they did not include a pouch for this one)Finally, my concern about the quick release -- the back of the strap features a quick-release buckle.. these scare me when you're talking about the buckle holding (sometimes) thousands of dollars of equipment. What if it snags and gets undone? what if someone comes up behind you and clicks the buckle?Some of my other R-Straps (the dual strap) include these buckles, and the thought has always freaked me out. I purchased the ""R-Strap Buck"" which is basically a safety clip for the buckle to prevent it from unbuckling (it locks the buckle together, so it cant be used unless you remove the buck (which wont happen accidentally)), for me the piece of mind was worth losing the quick release feature.I was glad to see that BlackRapid has improved the buckle though.. now in addition to the 2 side clips, it has a 3rd button that needs to be pressed (at the same time as the other 2) for it to actually release. This safety feature makes me feel a lot better about it.. but I still bought a Buck to keep it permanently locked.In the end.. I really like this strap. It's very compact, it's got a nice grip, it has the newer FastenR3 connector and a free Lockstar.. note that the rubber grip (instead of the previous fabric one) means you lose the extra pockets that those had (nice for batteries and whatnot)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12WTGMHRM2D7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFW69DE#wasThisHelpful","R12WTGMHRM2D7H","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've gone through quite a few lens caps -- the original canon caps (with sides on the tabs), 3rd party caps (with the center squeeze like this) and others with a lens-leash.I wasn't expecting it, but this lens cap is a serious improvement. A couple advantages are:Thicker/taller - Compared to 3rd party caps, this one stands a bit taller, making it easier to grip from the sides (you can squeeze the edges or the center to release it)Center-squeeze - One of the nicest benefits is that this makes it easy to attach/detach from a lens when using a lens hood. With the previous style, you wouldn't be able to have a lens hood attached and still be able to remove or attach the hood.Quality - I've used Sigma, Rocketfish and other 3rd-party branded lens caps with a similar look, and the quality here (albeit a weird thing to say about a lens cap) is noticeable. I've had cheaper ones break on me, be hard to release/put on, be loose or just have other issues.The only other difference I've noticed between these and the 3rd party ones are that some of the 3rd party ones allow for a ""lens leash"" to be attached (to keep the cap hanging from the lens so as not to lose it), but I'm more than happy to lose this benefit in place of the others gained.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2915ULG9P09RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2BWBCM#wasThisHelpful","R2915ULG9P09RW","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up about 8 of these for the Canon EOS-M and EOS-M2 (along with several CANON LP-E12 and several WASABI POWER LP-E12)All were fully charged using the Canon charger, all were new and showed full power in the EOS-M/M2 and were used in the same environments (with regular lenses, with IS lenses and with the same LCD screen settings (Screen off after 15 seconds, camera off after 5 minutes, AF Illumination light off, Touch focus off and On-Shot auto-focus on). Using several of each battery, all lasted roughly the same amount of time (~200-250 pictures).Seeing that the Opteka is rated at 2,000 mAH and the Canon is rated at 875mAH (I believe the Wasabi is 1100), I unfortunately did not notice any difference. The change may be apparent on other cameras that use the battery (the M/M2 are a mirrorless which use the LCD screen as a viewfinder), but I didn't notice that.With that said.. I can get 9 of these for the price of a Canon one, and they worked just as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11L5TQTQTV9AK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1W5MM0#wasThisHelpful","R11L5TQTQTV9AK","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item is a very small softbox -- about 9""I wouldn't use it as a main softbox (unless I absolutely had to) but it makes a nice one for a hair light, side light, etc..I purchased a few of these years ago and loved them. They fold flat, setup easily and have a little storage bag.. plus it's cheap!Fast forward to now, I purchased 2 more from Amazon and the item's changed.The softbox unfolds to the square shape and has 2 layers of diffusion (an inner layer and the main outer diffuser). Previously, both attached via Velcro and I had no issues. Easy to setup, easy to put away.The newer model uses clips on the inside which are very tough to attach/detach -- I actually kept mine attached due to the trouble in constantly putting it together and taking it apart, but when folder it feels like it's going to snap any moment. It hasn't yet, but I won't be surprised when it finally does, and it's not a good feeling.The outer layer still attaches with Velcro, but it's now a bit oversized. Previously, the outer diffuser was a nice fit, now it's a bit large. It doesn't affect the quality but makes it look a bit ""off"".In the end.. it's still a nice softbox if you need a small one, but the changes (for the worse) have been disappointing since I'd previously have given it a 5-star review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIG5ZRA04FUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC0YX92#wasThisHelpful","R3GIG5ZRA04FUW","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying I love the OP/TECH USA Lens Mount Cap. It's a heavy duty (very strong/protective) rear-lens cap for your lenses, with a rubber sealing on it to keep moisture out. I bought one for each of my lenses and loved them.When I saw this, I was interested -- I've always used my Canon original body cap (without issues) but wanted to give this a try.Note: The BODY CAP PROTECTIVE COVER (this item) goes onto the DSLR body when not using a lens.First issue was that it's not entirely clear on attaching it -- the Canon cap goes on easily, Lenses have a Red or White dot to line up with the mount, but this item has a slight raised area (easy to miss) that needs to be lined up with the lens mount to attach properly.Once attached, it's a very firm fit -- which can be good or bad. It's a bit scary when locking it since it feels like it could damage the body itself with how tight it is.The tightness is apparently a good thing as the inside of the mount included a rubber weather sealing.The big selling point for this is that it (can) protect  your camera a bit more than the plain Canon body cap that comes with the camera especially in dusty or wet environments where these can enter the DSLR housing. How common is this? I really couldn't tell you. I will say I'd feel better walking around somewhere like Burning Man or in a rainy area with this body cap attached than the default cap, but most likely I'd just have a lens attached.If you travel to any of those types of environments, check this item out. It's very strong, protective (?) and feels nicer than the original cap (it matches the feel of the higher end Canon bodies). If you're just looking at is as a replacement cap, it's probably not worth it (due to the somewhat hassle in attaching it, and the scary feeling of over tightening it)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8IH7M8LBK9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N2WDIW#wasThisHelpful","R1G8IH7M8LBK9V","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used plenty of coldshoes for Speedlights -- between the plastic ""feet"" included with many, to the stroboframe, to those included on radio receivers (RF-602) to those included on light modifier brackets.So far, the frio has felt the most secure to use, and best designed, despite a couple small gripes.First, some positives: Very compact, very sturdy, plenty of locking mechanisms (the ""snap-in"", the lock down feature with the flashes pin and the plastic covering the top portion of the flash hotshoe). Metal 1/4"" and 3/8"" threading on the bottom.Overall, very good -- the only couple gripes: Price -- it's expensive for what it is, especially when you see how basic it seems (adds up if buying multiple). The color: It's only available in this weird blue color.. why not black? Lastly, I hear some of the Canon flashes that use rubber weather sealing around the connector won't fit (those speedlights that use the twist-down locking mechanism will work)Comparing to some others:Stroboframe was the scariest I used -- a very small piece of metal that holds the speedlight only by the metal shoe -- it always seemed way off balance and like it was just going to snap the flash if I made any sudden movements with it. Price was also high.""Feet"" included with speedlights - Prior to these, the feet were my favorite. They're cheap (usually included free), have a lock-down mechanism and are very compact (plus they can sit on the floor without the need for a stand). These were a bit hit or miss as some used plastic threading and some used metal. Never had an issue though.Radio receivers - These are nice in that they're multi-function.. they'll typically work as a radio receiver, a flash mount and ""feet"" if needing to stand a flash on the ground. These are typically not much more than the frio, but a bit overkill if only using it for a flash coldshoe.Coldshoes included with modifiers -- Some modifiers, such as the EzyBox softbox, include a special coldshoe required to mount the speedlight. These, I'm not a fan of due to them trying to accomodate all flashes and typically not working great with any -- these use friction to hold the flash in but I've had a flash drop out of these before.Overall, it's a bit pricey, it's not the nicest looking, but in the end.. it's worked the best and I'd buy a few more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IRZAU815AKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNADZME#wasThisHelpful","R36IRZAU815AKW","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Yongnuo flashes for years and love them -- the YN560's are a great manual-flash, and the new YN560III pairs beautiful with the new YN560TX!The YN560III has a built in RF-602/RF-603 receiver, meaning you don't need a separate receiver. You can purchase a RF-602 TX or RF-603TX and trigger the flashes wirelessly.. until now, this has been a nice little bonus but with the YN560TX, it adds the ability to remotely change the power levels of the flashes from the camera itself (opposed to just sending a trigger signal). This is a great feature, one usually reserved for higher-cost ETTL models.A few nice features on it:* The YN560TX can pair up to 6 groups. You can have an A, B, C, D, E, F group and adjust each light separately.. If you assign 2 flashes to an ""A"" group, changing that setting on the YN560TX will change it on all ""A"" group flashes.* You can set the YN560TX to either RF602 or RF603 and 16 different channels each -- if you have an older flash (like a YN560II) you will need a RF602 or RF603 receiver to trigger the flash (Note: the wireless control will not work on YN560 or YN560II -- you need the 560III or newer). It will only trigger a RF602/603.* If you change the power with the YN560TX, you can also trigger those flashes with a RF602/RF603 transmitter set to the same channel (EX: Using 2 cameras one with a YN560TX and one with a RF602/RF603)On to the product -- it's a nice design - it looks like someone cut a YN560 in half and took off the flash head -- even down to the red front cover (which appears to be functionless/decoration-only?)Construction is solid, buttons are good and it has a good viewing angle/backlight (green)Setup is a bit tricky as there are 4 buttons, a TEST light, up/down/left/right/center and an on-off switch.. this means lots of holding multiple buttons at once to set features. For example, hold MODE+HZ/FN to change from RF602 to RF603.. A lot of these aren't very clear, and if in the field and needing to ""fix"" something, can be quite a challenge (even with the instruction manual, due to the way it's written). A nicer method would have been to have a ""Settings"" menu to change these rather than button presses (pressing 1 button, holding the same button, and holding the same button + another button all product different features).The hotshoe is metal ad has a locking/twist mechanism which is nice. The item's lightweight, even with batteries.. but it's pretty bulky (not deducting points for, since a lot of that is due to the screen size and buttons), but it's worth noting.Unfortunately, where I started to discover some problems were with it being somewhat unreliable when using multiple -- I picked up 3 of these to use with 3 different cameras. You CAN use multiple together, but settings don't always send the way you'd like them to. For example I'll call these 560TX-A and 560TX-BIf 560TX-A is set to 1/1 power on channel A and 560TX-B is set to 1/4 power on channel A, the one which was set LAST takes priority. If you want the 2nd transmitters' settings to send, you need to use the ""Group"" button to highlight the channel (EX: ""A"") for about 2 seconds for it to send that signal. If using 1 channel, it's not bad.. if using 3, 4, 5 or 6 it's kind of annoying. I bought this thinking it sent the ""power level"" signal when it transmitted the ""Flash"" signal, which is not the case.My other gripe was that it was hit or miss, even at close distances (~5 feet). With fresh batteries in a brand new YN560III and in the YN560TX, I would have some flashes failing to ""flash"" every few shots.. Trying with a RF602 transmitter, the problem went away. I don't know why it does this, and it would alternate between flashes that wouldn't fire (the flashes were recharged, on a lower level (not overheating) and tried with multiple sets of new batteries in each and different YN560TX's). Outdoors seemed to work better, however","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2FAHYCM2RVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIDWTIC#wasThisHelpful","R3V2FAHYCM2RVI","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently picked up 2 Canon EOS-M cameras and the lens adapter was a big selling point for me on the camera. I bought 2 of these ""White Box"" models and they do appear to be official Canon adapters.White Box is exactly what it sounds like -- it comes in a white box with no other documentation (instructions, warranty card, etc..)I have heard that ""White Box"" is typically the designation given to canon  products that were split from larger bundles (EX: Canon EOS-M + Adapter set, or a Canon 5D + 24-105mm lens), splitting it apart and selling the included item separately.The mount does have a serial # included on it, but again no warranty card (which may or may not be an issue if you need warranty service. With that said, the price of the White Box model is very inexpensive and probably cheaper to replace than repair)Included with it are 2 caps: Front cap (Canon EF Body cap) and rear cap (EF-M Rear lens cap). There is also a 1/4"" 20 threading on the bottom of the mount (good if you plan to mount a larger lens so you're not applying all the weight onto the tiny EOSM body from a larger lens).There is no glass in the adapter. It appears to be a Metal material (or at least a VERY sturdy plastic).It has contacts to enable Autofocus, Aperture adjustments, Lens data information transfer/EXIF, Image stabilization or any other settings from lenses (some cheaper ones do not allow these).It works with Canon EF and EF-S lenses as well as 3rd party EF/EF-S lenses.It has a locking mechanism on the lens, with a release switch (similar to the one on the body) to keep it from accidentally releasing the lens.Overall great value.. adds a LOT to the Canon EOSM camera!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OUAKD8SLZCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJZDO1G#wasThisHelpful","R10OUAKD8SLZCI","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using DSLR's for almost 8 years now and have avoided the EOS M for the longest time -- I prefer the large size of a heavy DSLR with battery grip, so the benefits of a ""small camera"" never did much for me.. especially if making compromises.I have 3 DSLRs (xD and xxD and xxxD series canon) and honestly bought this because it was cheap (I typically use multiple bodies to be able to have multiple lenses ready at all times, opposed to changing). With some of my older bodies showing age (10 megapixel, older sensor) the price of about 300 bucks for the EOS M, the 22mm f2 and the EF adapter (with a couple spare batteries) was about half of what a new Canon Rebel would have cost. I didn't buy this to replace a camera, or as a first camera, but to compliment my existing ones.The EOSM is VERY small and light.. this works both for and against you. The small size will make it easier to shoot in public without the visibility of holding a large pro camera (it looks closer to a point & shoot than a DSLR, with the 22mm f2 lens).. but if doing a photoshoot with it, people will take you less seriously (it looks like you're doing a 'professional' shoot with a point & shoot).. Doesn't affect the quality whatsoever, but it is something to keep in mind.The camera itself is nice -- most of the functions are done on the touchscreen (such as focus points) which are nicer than some of the DSLRs and using the dial to select a focus point), but changing the ISO, Aperture, Shutter, etc.. are also via touchscreen. It would have been nice to have taken the actual controls for the Canon G-Series point & shoots instead of going all touch. On the same note, they seem to have taken the Rebels' minimized ISO settings (100, 200, 400, 800, etc...) opposed to the 100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 320, 400, etc.. of the higher end models.No wifi or GPS built in (I believe they added them in the M2).. these would be nice, but not necessary. A tilting screen would have been much nicer (since there is no viewfinder)Camera uses a SD slot, shoots RAW or JPEG. It has a weird (and somewhat questionable) camera strap.. nice that it comes off/attached easily but kind of scary with how easy it can be removed. I'll be using an R-Strap with it. No handstrap option or battery grip options available.The camera has a normal 1/4"" 20 tripod threading on the bottom (lined with the center of lens). If you buy the EF Adapter, it also included a tripod threading on the collar (great for heavier lenses). The hotshoe on top is a real, standard hot shoe and works fine with hotshoe accessories, flashes and wireless transmitters.Photo quality is VERY nice.. same as from a nice DSLR (use good glass/lenses with it!). Autofocus is a bit slow, but really it works fine for me.. the thing to keep in mind is if you're having someone pose for a photo, you're fine. Modeling, it's fine. Group shots, fine. Landscapes, fine. Only problem is if you're shooting sports.. I wouldn't use this for any fast movements as it probably won't focus quick enough.I highly recommend the 22mm f2 lens (even if you have good EF lenses -- the 22mm is a really nice lens) and recommend the EF adapter (theyre now under 50 bucks for a canon-branded one). The EF adapter lets you use canon EF and EFS lenses, including aperture/autofocus and image stabilizer.Overall, I'm really enjoying it and considering buying a 2nd one to carry with a different lens. The price (late 2014) is great.. at its full price I would have passed. With it having not taken off, and the M2 only releasing in Japan, chances of an M3 are very low.EDIT: Just about a week after buying this, I picked up a 2nd one. For the price, it can't be beat and I wanted to grab a 2nd (for when I don't want to bring multiple DSLR's along) before they're gone entirely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R216SQYIIYCPI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NENG1A#wasThisHelpful","R216SQYIIYCPI4","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Picked this up and.. it works! The 2 Oz. side is plenty (in fact, I think even .5 oz would be enough). What I do is open the cap, stick the needle into the opening and lift it out, letting any excess oil run off of it before putting it into the airbrush.

"I mainly picked this up to clean my airbrush -- most of the pieces can be cleaned by hand using a variety of tools (brushes cleaner liquids, airbrush pipe cleaners, etc..) but they're both a time-consuming process and don't get everything -- especially the needle tips and heads, they tend to keep paint stuck on (or more likely, inside) them. Over time these not only make the airbrush look heavily used, but begin to clog quicker. Even using the items above, a few places couldnt be easily cleaned (the insides of the small needle tips and threaded parts of the airbrush, for example).Picking this up, I was able to disassemble and clean an airbrush gun within 10 minutes (with only about 1 minute of that being actual effort/work).The item itself is pretty straight-forward.. it's a large dish with a lid, and 2 buttons: On and Off. No timers, no settings, no countdown on the top.The inside is lined in metal and includes a small plastic basket for tiny pieces, and a plastic stand for watches.Fill the thing with your cleaner of choice (I usually fill with water and a couple cap-fulls of the included liquid -- I hear people use dish soap or windex with good results), hit the ON button and wait for it to turn off (it auto-shuts-off after 3 minutes).I tend to do 2 run-throughs with a cleaning fluid (6 minutes total) and then 1 final one with just clean water to get any chemicals off, then let it dry.Tried a pair of glasses and it also worked very nice - got any small bits of dirt that are normally not accessible due to the tight spots they're in.I haven't used this as a full replacement for cleaning, I typically clean out the airbrush briefly and then put it in the ultrasonic cleaner when it needs a more thorough cleaning.The only downsides I see are.. it's small. Real small. I was expecting it to be bigger.. this thing is maybe 6.5"" long by 4"" wide on the inside, and it's oval shapes, so those are the widest dimensions. Once you put the plastic liner in, it's even smaller. This is kind of nice if you need to clean small items, but it may require multiple ""fills"" of items depending how much you need to clean. I've seen some where people will put 3-4 airbrushes in at once without any problem.. this one fills easily with just 1.The unit also has a permanent blue LED shining into the tank (even when off) which may be an issue for those wanting to keep it plugged in.It also doesn't have settings for time -- just on/off (3 minutes at a time) and also no countdown timer.

"I've owned quite a few of the yongnuo flashes, from the earlier YN460/N460-II/YN465 to the YN560, YN560II and now the YN560IIIThe YN560III, being nearly the same price as the YN560 and YN560II is the best yet -First off -- Biggest feature is that these now include a built-in receiver (letting you use an existing RF-602, RF-603 or the new YN560TX). I had plenty of RF-602s and now the YN560TX and both work perfect, but they're a little awkward/confusing to set up (more on that later)In terms of looks, it's almost identical to the YN560II - a couple differences are:* Backlight is now a yellowish tint, was previously an orange* The buttons have been revised to allow more featuresI put new batteries in the YN560I, II and III and fired them all simulataneously at full power and all seemed to recycle about the same speed (no improvements here)The YN560III includes a soft pouch to carry it and a plastic coldshoe stand (Yongnuo seems to have stopped including the Stofen-like diffuser in their new flashes)The YN560III still has the high-voltage battery socket on the side (a nice feature, since they've dropped it on their higher end flashes) and runs of 4x AA batteries (Tip: Get Eneloops!)The reason for buying these was the compatibility with the YN560TX.. This replaces the RF602/RF603 and sits on your camera but lets you set the flash power wirelessly.. You can set up to 6 groups of flashes and change the power levels from the camera itself. I use multiple cameras and was able to put a YN560TX on each camera, set to different settings, and trigger it that way -- it did seem to get a little confused, but overall did work nice (much better than changing the settings on the flashes each time)So now the problem.. The YN560III has the same amount of buttons as the earlier models, but has a LOT more features built in. This means you need to learn odd button combinations (on the YN560II, each button was a dedicated function, on the III, if you press a button you get one feature, Hold it you'll get a different feature and hold 2 buttons you'll get another feature). They're not entirely clear on how to do certain things (like changing from the default RF603 to the RF602) and even the manual doesn't expain this. Overall though.. it works, and it works nice so I do recommend the upgrade. If you're fine with the existing YN560/YN560III and don't need the wireless control, you can pass on these.The RF602/RF603 can be set to (I believe) 16 channels each, and can be triggered with either the 602/603 or the YN560TX transmitter.. You can also use the YN560TX transmitter to fire other flashes on a RF602/RF603 receiver (if you have ones like the YN560/YN560II, or other models)The big downside is the lack of ETTL -- I personally don't use it, but that's something Yongnuo reserves for the higher end models. For the price, I love these things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36969MGK42V2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I44F5LS#wasThisHelpful","R36969MGK42V2Z","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Final Seal for a while now and have loved it -- works great on effects makeups/powders and with airbrushes.. while providing a nice fragrance!It comes in a number of sizes from a small bottle to this extra large ""jug"" -- if you plan to use it for a single event, a small bottle will do just fine. The larger size is for someone who wants to use it for quite a few different coverages (a makeup artist, cosplayer, etc..). The cost of the larger size isn't very much compared to the small size, but keep in mind it comes in a large container with no easy applicator. I picked up one of these and it easily lasted about 30-40 large applications (face/arms/legs), I imagine most will get even most uses out of it.I recommend getting a small spray bottle (very inexpensive) if going for one of these larger (16 oz) bottles.. the cost savings are quite a bit over the smaller bottles.The seal goes on with a nice minty fragrance (kind of like a mouthwash) which people seem to like -- it won't dry liquids (such as fake bloods) but will do a nice job with keeping most others from smearing.It also works very nice with the Ben Nye Magicolor when using an airbrush (by itself, the magicolor is a bit too thick to properly spray). They suggest using a small amount, but about 50/50 (magicolor + final seal) seems to work really nice for me.Overall, nice product, not too bad in price if buying in bulk (16 oz). Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7SNJQQ4GUN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ATCG7S#wasThisHelpful","R2O7SNJQQ4GUN2","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The EW-73C is a nice lens hood for the Canon 10-18mm  lens --I typically shoot at night and dont notice much of a problem with flare on this, but bought the hood for protection - being an ultra-wide, you tend to get closer to the subjects and it's a safe way to keep your lens from being damaged (either too close to the ground or a wall, or anything else). The hood is a nice size and provides protection for the lens (especially if not using a UV filter) which is really nice -- I imagine it also cuts down quite a bit on lens flare. Would be nice if Canon packaged these with their non-L lenses or at least sold them for a bit lower in price.. otherwise a very nice item!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31LYM75EVWIH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K899BZ8#wasThisHelpful","R31LYM75EVWIH1","A2ARDVMUGDFED6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ARDVMUGDFED6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I truly enjoyed reading this book. Ultimately, the life of William Haines is about two things - one is a story of enduring love, and the other is a man who stood on principle and lived his life as he believed he should. His life is also a story of reinvention, of being open and prepared to change course at any time. Today you're a box office movie star, but tomorrow you just might be the ticket-taker or the usher.The only time I found myself skimming entire passages was during some of the author's flowing descriptions about interior decoration. A little bit was fascinating, but some of these details were a little bit over the top. At some points in the narration, I really wanted to yell at the author: ""Dude, calm the **** down."" I'm also not sure that it was completely necessary to track down the young boy who had once accused William Haines' partner of molesting him, to get his side of the story, sixty years later. No criminal charges were ever filed and recreating the gory details only added an ick factor to an otherwise flawless story. Other than these few mentions, this is a book well worth reading for anyone who has an interest in the history of Hollywood and the early decades of the film industry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PA5I8JKTF5EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670871559#wasThisHelpful","R2PA5I8JKTF5EC","A3NG7X4APIV649","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NG7X4APIV649?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Given the low price, this is a surprisingly high-quality men's t-shirt. I chose it for the boyfriend, but then I tried it on first, and I ended up keeping it for myself. One specific detail makes this product stand out - the store/manufacturer hang tag was fastened to the inside the neck of the shirt with a small safety pin. Instead of being attached with a ridiculously tight plastic tie that leaves a big hole in some part of the shirt after you remove it. This bit with the safety pin is classy. Also, the boyfriend, after examining the shirt more closely, believes it is a house brand (generic label) of some way more expensive designer product clothing line, and I would tend to agree. This is the kind of men's t-shirt you'd find (in the good old days) in a high-end department store, even if it wasn't terribly expensive. Even the fabric feels expensive.

"Here's what you should know about me first as a consumer. I am a furniture snob. I hate particle board. Everything inside my house is real wood, the kind of furniture my kids call ""grandma furniture."" If a piece of furniture doesn't require the help of four grown men to move it, usually I don't want it. But I absolutely love this table. Yes, it's made out of plastic, but it looks really nice inside my house.

It also slides easily and can be moved without difficulty.Although it's not the same quality, the table complements this wicker chair that I've owned for a few years, and at a casual glance, you wouldn't know that the ottoman is plastic and the chair is made out of a high-quality wicker weave.

"I figured out the key secret to make this daddy work. Let's just say you live across the street from Starbucks, which offers free Wi-Fi to its customers. It would be nice to have access to that open and unsecured (no password required) free Wi-Fi network, just in case the home internet connection that you pay for suddenly quits working. But maybe that Starbucks Wi-Fi signal is just a little bit too weak and you can't connect up with it reliably from your penthouse apartment. With this Amped Wireless router, now you can.You set this device up in repeater mode, then do a search for nearby 2.4ghz  and 5ghz Wi-Fi networks. It's a tad annoying that you have to choose both, but what you're really interested in at this point are the open 2.4ghz Wi-Fi networks, because 5ghz WI-Fi is still not commonly available for free.Then you are going to clone the Starbucks Wi-Fi and whatever 5 ghz network you chose -  If the 5 ghz Wi-Fi network is your own, make sure you put a password on that puppy. Now back to Starbucks.At first when I made this magic happen, I was high-fiving myself and walking through my neighborhood, checking out the Wi-Fi signal I had created. It goes for blocks. Then I realized this was a problem. The network you create with this repeater device has a name that looks something like this: Starbucks Customer WIFI_RE. The RE is you, short for ""repeater."" The reason this is a problem? I live in the OG hood with a lot of neighbors who are on parole. (Don't ask me how I know this to be true. I just do.) So I really don't want to share my poached Wi-Fi network with all of these people, some of whom are card-carrying parolees registered as Friends of Meagan. All I need is for one of them to start downloading bad stuff, using my IP address and my poached Wi-Fi Starbucks network, and the next thing you know, I'm going to be spending the rest of my life in Club Fed.Basically you can be held responsible for what someone else does with your open Wi-Fi network. How does Starbucks stay out of trouble? They have a corporate Wi-Fi account - and this means they are not technically held responsible for perverts downloading bad stuff using the free Starbucks Wi-Fi service. But since this router is your own personal equipment, you are responsible for it, and you need to be careful about who has access to your poached Starbucks Wi-Fi RE network.So what did I do? I made the network invisible. Choose the option ""Hide this network's SSID"" and voila, the only way anyone can find your poached Starbucks Wi-Fi RE network is if they know this complicated name and they type it into their Wi-Fi list under ""others."" A dedicated IT person or a hacker might be able to find it, but we're not worried about them. The problem is the Friends of Meagan who live next door to you. They really shouldn't be using your open Wi-Fi network.Now, I am in no way advocating the stealing of someone else's Wi-Fi network, and as a matter of fact, I'm continuing to pay for cable internet, because I need to have a wicked fast and reliable internet connection. What you get with this poached Starbucks Wi-Fi RE is a slower internet connection - and there's no guarantee the free fun will last forever. Note: I am using Starbucks as a generic stand-in for whatever corporation has an open Wi-Fi signal that is available in your neighborhood. It could be Panera Bread, McDonald's or any other food business that offers free open Wi-Fi to customers, and for the record, there is no Starbucks in my neighborhood. Because I live on the bad side of town. (You know you screwed up big time in life when there's no Starbucks within walking distance of where you live.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387U7LYMP7O7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W77DZ0G#wasThisHelpful","R387U7LYMP7O7Q","A3NG7X4APIV649","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NG7X4APIV649?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CASINO ROYALE is a truly innovative and totally captivating Bond film. Daniel Craig is terrific. He combines intellect, wit and brute force and always remains the brooding thinking man's Bond. I suppose CASINO ROYALE is a re-birth or re-introduction of the series some ways and it works incredibly well. I was very impressed with David Arnold's score as well. He refers to the Bond theme very sparingly, yet it one of the best scores of the series. After DIE ANOTHER DAY took Bond in a different direction direction and pushing that envelope, CASINO ROYALE brings Bond to a more reality based world where a hero relies on his own resourcefulness and ingenuity and runs with it.Now with the release of SPECTRE, CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE are given a new perspective and strengthens the points I have made all along. QUANTUM OF SOLACE is artistic and psychological visual storytelling. QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is character driven.Looking at QUANTUM OF SOLACE closer, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.SKYFALL is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? Now with SPECTRE released, I believe it is. With time, I see that this really is a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I didn't. Reflect on it I suppose.

This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.QUANTUM OF SOLACE has swept aside and maligned since the release of SKYFALL. QUANTUM OF SOLACE was the second film of the James Bond re-boot started with CASINO ROYALE. Somehow SKYFALL seemed to not follow the continuity after QUANTUM OF SOLACE where Bond was on the top of his game. Of the 4 Daniel Craig Bond films thus far, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is still my favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5O5I2WFHBOOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MHBVT8#wasThisHelpful","R5O5I2WFHBOOV","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Groundbreaking and Outstanding! I suppose this is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? That remains to be seen. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I didn't. Reflect on it I suppose. SKYFALL is a good Bond film and with the release of SPECTRE ties in QUANTUM OF SOLACE strengthening Daniel Craig's 4 Bond films.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V4VDIFDBBVC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142WJOS0#wasThisHelpful","R2V4VDIFDBBVC6","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LIFE: 50 Years of James Bond is a good compendium of the first 50 years of the cinematic James Bond. The focus is clearly on the formative years with Sean Connery and Ian Fleming's struggle to bring his blunt instrument to the screen. George Lazenby is given a good look at. Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan are glossed over. The focus then returns on Daniel Craig and how he updated and revitalized the character.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LF5V1FM4KHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F2RF66#wasThisHelpful","R8LF5V1FM4KHB","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is a big-budgeted opulent Bond film, with a lively and strong screenplay by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum and very effective editing by John Glen, delivering one of the most succinctly structured films of the series under the direction of Lewis Gilbert. After THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN Roger Moore clearly redefined his approach to the role as the good-natured British agent. His Bond is suave, debonair, never condescending and resorts to seriousness only when confronted with malevolence. That was the way he played it for the rest of the series. The globetrotting THE SPY WHO LOVED ME featured a gadget laden Lotus Esprit as its centerpiece along with Richard Kiel as the indestructible Jaws the villain's henchman with steel teeth. The main villain of the piece is the maniacal Karl Stromberg, played with detached amusement by Curt Jurgens, whose immense wealth featured an aquatic empire aimed at global domination. Bond must pair up with Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova played by Barbara Bach to track down missing nuclear submarines. The pre-title sequence features a very thrilling and well-filmed ski chase re-establishing James Bond as a major force to be reckoned with. Marvin Hamlisch composed a very effective score to the surprise of many. His music is right on mark and in some sequences very innovative. Hamlisch proves that he really knows how to score a film. Ken Adam returned as production designer bringing a familiar look back to the series not seen since DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Ken Adam also introduced some new concepts giving the film a well-known but unique look. New characters are introduced in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME who would return in subsequent films of the series. They include Walter Gotell as Russian General Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the British Minister of Defense and Eva Reuber-Staier as Rubelvitch, Gogol's secretary. Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and in expanded roles Bernard Lee as ""M"" and Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" Major Boothroyd are all back. There are well-choreographed great action scenes, beautiful underwater sequences, battles and chases. Some of the best-unsung workmanship in this film is the extraordinary miniatures by Derek Meddings. They are incredible and make this film very impressive and memorable. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is one of those rare films where all the talents come together at their peek of perfection delivering an impeccable film.THE SPY WHO LOVED ME revived and brought new life, renewing the James Bond series for both new and old fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22U62VZX1N05I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M5AJM2#wasThisHelpful","R22U62VZX1N05I","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GODFATHER, PART III  is a highly underrated film. THE GODFATHER, PART III stands alone in many ways. The stage is set with PARTS I and II, but THE GODFATHER, PART III builds upon that as its foundation. THE GODFATHER, PART III has a unique operatic quality to it setting it apart from its predecessors. There is this idea of redemption for pasts deeds where duty to family existed, but without honor and lack of moral fiber from beliefs from the divine entity from whom they were created. That is the conundrum. That is the sadness. that is the setting from which there is no escape. THE GODFATHER, PART III is an operatic epic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6W8UYUI7NCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007Y08NI#wasThisHelpful","RI6W8UYUI7NCU","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It did not take long for a-ha's new CD to grow on me when it was first releasd. As usual some of those songs remain in your head after listening to them and you anticipate playing the CD again and again to get that somewhat euphoric feeling. The very first track, CELICE really grew on me and I quite enjoy it. At first I thought it wasn't quite up to their usual aesthetics but I was wrong. CELICE is very good. I was also engrossed by COSY PRISONS, ANALOGUE, BIRTHRIGHT and WHITE DWARF. They all give me a little boost of the spirit and I like that feeling. At first I thought this CD was just an extension of their last two studio CDs but ANALOGUE really is in a new yet familiar sounding direction. This CD is very soothing and relaxing to listen to. The sound of a-ha is still there. It is forever present.

"THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film. What a great opening sequence! This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct.After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be. The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. Going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RLO75FUTH7CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2TD6Q2#wasThisHelpful","R3RLO75FUTH7CX","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SESSION 9 is directed by Brad Anderson and was released in 2001. This amazing psychological horror film focuses on happenings through an asbestos abatement team's findings and feelings as they work and rummage through an abandoned mental asylum. The Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts is the setting for the film. The team discovers a box marked ""Evidence"" and it contains 9 taped sessions with a patient. This is fascinating stuff and very eerie. It makes your skin crawl. It is interesting to see David Caruso in this film and he adds a great deal of authenticity and believability through his performance. This film was shot in HD digital video and gives it a feel of authenticity. I like this film because it creates a very real sense of uneasiness through the darkness and uncertainty of implied events.

"THE SAND PEBBLES is a very effective historically based narrative focusing on China during the 1926 revolution as seen through and affecting the U.S.S. San Pablo assigned to patrol the Yangtze River. This richly textured Robert Wise film is full of many interesting performances especially from Richard Crenna, Mako, Richard Attenborough and Simon Oakland, and especially Steve McQueen. Crenna's character as the Captain of the San Pablo is truly enigmatic and somehow parallels that of Steve McQueen's seaman Jake Holman who is not restrained from doing the right thing when diplomacy dictates otherwise. Steve McQueen is ordered to the San Pablo for his transgressions and comes to terms with his own cynicism and outward lack of humanity, which has been beaten into his misunderstood past. His relationship with the Mako, whom he trains to maintain the ship's engine makes McQueen see the humanity in himself and those of a different race and culture and realizes the basic good in himself. Mako's tragic death seen is very moving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film and McQueen's agony touches you like no other film I have ever seen. This film contains one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores full of brooding bravado and sentiment. This is also one of the best films Robert Wise directed and he truly directed some great ones. THE SAND PEBBLES is a very soul searching and unforgettable film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YLFQPBOSXRHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8TWZZY#wasThisHelpful","R2YLFQPBOSXRHI","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. Going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULPZ7GVIRWG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1NYDM6#wasThisHelpful","R2ULPZ7GVIRWG3","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The DR. NO soundtrack brings you back to the days when albums were made to be listened to as lounge music, for lack of a better term, and the like. When the filmmakers decided on a musical score for DR. NO they had to decide on the direction the music would take. Would they go for an action, detective yarn, science fiction, mystery or suspense score? Would they focus on the plot elements, the characters or locale for inspiration? There had been spy films before, but not like this one. They must have turned to the Ian Fleming novels for their initial inspiration. Fleming's world was one of globe trotting exploits relying heavily on his knowledge of the local flavors that Bond traversed. If you listen to ""Dr. No's Fantasy"" this must have been the original version that Monty Norman composed for Bond's theme. Its guitar riff contains the foreign intrigue sound that would have been popular for that era. This is a very nostalgic album. The version of the ""James Bond Theme"" on this album is the definitive version. ""Twisting With James"" really brings me back to the good old days. In all, this is a very nostalgic album. ""Under the Mango Trees"" brings back so many good memories.

"GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well-honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE in some respects. But, in GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25VIMJ9YS7EVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1NYDKS#wasThisHelpful","R25VIMJ9YS7EVH","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This film has another of James Horner's best scores. The ""Epilogue and End Credits"" are excellent and contain great melodies. I have not heard that word since my days on my high school chess team. I have always wanted to see SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and somehow just seemed to miss it. I finally caught it on the Sundance Channel and have watched at least 3 times now. This film was worth the wait. Let me tell you. This is a great film. You don't have to like Chess. You don't even have to play Chess. Yes, this film lets you into that world that I was once part of, but better yet, it separates men and boys who have that higher level of insight into the game, it separates them by their passion and honor and dedication for the game and for those mere mortals who play the game on that same field. What is the purpose of the game? I think the film asks that question. And I think the film answers it aptly. I remember once at a tournament that I offered my opponent a draw even though it was evident that I had clearly beaten him. I overheard that if my opponent did not win or draw he was off his school's team. When I watched SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER that all came back to me.

"HONDO is a solid Western in the best tradition of the genre. Based on the story ""The Gift of Cochise"" by Louis L'Amour, John Wayne brings the character Hondo Lane to the screen juxtaposed with his familiar screen presence yet true to L'Amour's spirit of the literary ""Western."" James Edward Grant's script is impressively sympathetic to the American Indian given the period when this film was produced. Geraldine Page as Angie is perfectly nave as the homesteader living alone with her son in the open wilderness of rock and dust (artistically captured by Robert Burks' cinematography). However, it is John Wayne's portrayal as the enigmatically tough yet unemotionally tender survivor of this barren country that is the strength of this film. The music for HONDO is credited to both Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer and their impressive melody for HONDO majestically reflects the honorable and brave stature of the man.What is interesting and probably what immediately drew me to the Spaghetti Western genre was that it held a very out of the ordinary romantic vision, not of the west, but rather a romanticized vision of the loneliness of its heroes or perhaps more perfectly its anti-heroes. If you listen to Ennio Morricones scoring of the Morton sequence in Sergio Leones THE ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, he captures the loneliness and pathos of these characters that traverse these strange western landscapes in such melodic splendor that your heart just reaches out to the whole mythology and you become overwhelmed by the euphoria of sight and sound. Leones THE ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST may in one sense be the elegiac expression of this idea as we see the old giving way to the new in death and life simply going on as the landscape evolves to whatever new times bring.1969's TRUE GRIT with John Wayne is such an unlikely John Wayne Western. It is simply a Western and a good one. It was directed by Henry Hathaway had has all the hallmarks of his style. This film has a great cast and a wonderful score composed by Elmer Bernstein.

"QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is character driven.Looking at QUANTUM OF SOLACE closer, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.QUANTUM OF SOLACE has swept aside and maligned since the release of SKYFALL. QUANTUM OF SOLACE was the second film of the James Bond re-boot started with CASINO ROYALE. Somehow SKYFALL seemed to not follow the continuity after QUANTUM OF SOLACE where Bond was on the top of his game. Of the 3 Daniel this far, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is my favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W8KWTQ0W7ZY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAWVB3M#wasThisHelpful","R1W8KWTQ0W7ZY9","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN is a bit of a dichotomy. It starts off extremely humorous with a base in some form of reality. However, as the film progresses its drifts into the world of the surreal. This film does contain some extremely good scenes but it almost comes off as a very strange dream.

"THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN is a bit of a dichotomy. It starts off extremely humorous with a base in some form of reality. However, as the film progresses its drifts into the world of the surreal. This film does contain some extremely good scenes but it almost comes off as a very strange dream. Herbert  Lom really comes into his own in this film. He is outrageously funny and steals this film. Mancini's theme and score is once again on target and extremely innovative.

"I liked SON OF THE PINK PANTHER immensely. To me it reverts to a style of comedy found in the original PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK. What is sad is that SON OF THE PINK PANTHER is just out of step for its time. I thought Roberto Benigni's performance was a hoot. He was perfect. It is a silly film and so were the originals. But this film has heart and an endearing quality to it. It was once again great to see Herbert Lom as Police Commisioner Charles Dreyfus, Burt Kwouk as Cato Fong,  Graham Stark playing Professor Auguste Balls and Claudia Cardinale playing Maria Gambrelli. The score was once again composed by Henry Mancini and he is even seen in the film's credits. I believe this was his last cinematic score. At the helm of it all was Blake Edwards once more a his final time. There is just something very nostalgic about SON OF THE PINK PANTHER. I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R135X8I3DQHAO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CNFC4E#wasThisHelpful","R135X8I3DQHAO4","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CAMELOT. Joshua Logan directed this outstanding film. It is visually stunning and full of great emotion and yet seems to have a very great cerebral perspective overall in its effect. The picture wavers in tone and seems a bit episodic, but it does have skillful bits of genius tucked in among the gayety, pomp and circumstance, love, war and reflection. This is very uncharacteristic filmmaking from Logan. Richard Harris' King Arthur is beautifully underplayed and unfathomable at times. But he achieves some very effective moments in this unique telling of the Arthur legend. The movie is somewhat dark at times as it juxtaposes humor, which is biting such as is seen in the performance by David Hemmings and the screen presence of Franco Nero very foreign Sir Lancelot. It's a film that may grow on you each time you return to it. It did for me. CAMELOT is a highly underrated classic and somehow seems forgotten as Hollywood musicals were in their death-throws.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XY3NLT3A6SMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013FG7US#wasThisHelpful","R2XY3NLT3A6SMR","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards are at their Best in A SHOT IN THE DARK. The Pink Panther (Inspector Clouseau) films were so popular that once seen you will never forget them. Whether it was the animated image of the Pink Panther or images of Peter Sellers' bumbling yet likeable screen personification of Inspector Clouseau or Henry Mancini's unmistakable theme you never forget.A SHOT IN THE DARK has somehow come up short with the younger fans for no good reason other than its title. It does not say ""Pink Panther"" yet once discovered A SHOT IN THE DARK is a true gem. A SHOT IN THE DARK is a great example of sophisticated slapstick (screenplay by Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty based on plays by Harry Kurnitz and Marcel Achard). A SHOT IN THE DARK has Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Kato, which THE PINK PANTHER did not. A SHOT IN THE DARK focuses on Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. It is really more character based and driven than THE PINK PANTHER. In many ways A SHOT IN THE DARK is much funnier. It really defines the character of Clouseau a good-natured inspector who just cannot see the forest for the trees. George Sanders is once again brilliant in another similar role, the type that he perfected throughout his career. This time he is the very sardonic yet stately Benjamin Ballon one of Clouseau's suspects. The cast also includes Elke Sommer (the most obvious suspect to the audience), Tracy Reed, Graham Stark and Martin Benson. The opening shot (shots in the dark) and the nudist colony scenes are great examples of Blake Edwards' direction at his best. Production designer Michael Stringer and cinematographer Christopher Challis visually replicate the idea of shots and murder taking place in the dark or at least in places where passions run uncontrollable.A SHOT IN THE DARK has a much different look than the invigorating and opulent images found in THE PINK PANTHER. Henry Mancini once again delivers a very good score. A SHOT IN THE DARK's main title theme is very good but has been greatly overshadowed by THE PINK PANTHER theme. But can you blame it? A SHOT IN THE DARK is somehow in a league of its own yet it spawned all the great supporting characters found in the subsequent films which we all came to love and couldn't get enough of. A SHOT IN THE DARK was the foundation for what was to come and made the world of Inspector Clouseau so enduring and endearing yet there is something very different and special about this one film. It is somehow etched in a time that can never be replicated. To really enjoy it try to place yourself back in that time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28BUURJW6AXA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013U658W#wasThisHelpful","R28BUURJW6AXA2","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was never really fond of this film, even though it was Peter Sellers' last portrayal of Inspector Clouseau. It started out excellent but slowly deteriorated into mundane and silly slapstick. By the time it reached Hong Kong I thought it was terrible. Even Henry Mancini's score seems a little tired in this one. It all seems like very forced filmmaking. I suppose some of the same things could be said about CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER but in that film the script follows a logical progression from the classic Clouseau skits to slapstick and finally into the absurd. It seemed to work wildly in that film. I actually found the scenes in TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER with Peter Sellers much funnier than in THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER. THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER remains a weak entry in the series for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R122C012RHI3EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017SUD0Q#wasThisHelpful","R122C012RHI3EW","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER is that it returned Peter Sellers to the role of Inspector Jacques Clouseau under Blake Edwards' direction after Alan Arkin's single portrayal in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU directed by Bud Yorkin. More importantly it did not only return Sellers but it also instituted the Pink Panther and Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in a legitimate film series instead of just a few sporadic sequels and it launched a huge cinematic rebirth and phenomenon. Unfortunately this film seems to lack the magic of 1964's THE PINK PANTHER and the sophistication of A SHOT IN THE DARK. Christopher Plummer replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton in this film. Plummer is good but it seems a shame since Niven reprised his role later in 1982's TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER and 1983's CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER, which were made after Sellers' death (in 1980) in an attempt to revive the series without him. Catherine Schell as Claudine Litton lacked the charisma of earlier leading ladies Capucine and Elke Sommer. On the plus side, Sellers is brilliant as Clouseau as are Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Kato back and featured prominently in the rest of all the subsequent Pink Panther films. Much needed and returning is a score composed by Henry Mancini a very integral component of this series. THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER has some very good comic sketches and a very good opening jewel heist but the script just doesn't seem to be a very cohesive force. However, better things were yet to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RUCISM0C2LI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038IIPLW#wasThisHelpful","R38RUCISM0C2LI","A7Y6AVS576M03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7Y6AVS576M03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an absolutely gorgeous set of solar powered multicolored LED string lights with a clear plastic starfish cover. The set is 20' long with 30 bright led bulbs that can operate in a total of eight different modes such as steady on, slow flashing, sequential flashing, twinkling and more.  I really like these better than any of my other string lights because when they're set on ""twinkling"" they look like gorgeous red, green, yellow, and purple twinkling stars!I love solar lights since they can be used anywhere without worrying about outlets or extension cords.  Just peel the protective film off the solar panel before you use it or it could melt onto the panel and reduce efficiency.  Place the panel where it can get 6 - 8 hours of direct sunlight per day to charge and the and set the lights to ""on"" and they'll charge during the day, come on at night, go off again at dawn etc... With a full charge they'll stay lit between 8 - 15 hours depending on the mode you have them set to. There's a bit over 5' of cord between the solar panel and the first starfish, so there's plenty of lead to place the panel someplace.These have a total of 8 operating modes from steady on to sequential, fast flash, slower flash, half on half off, to twinkling and more. I happen to adore the twinkling look as I mentioned, but you can experiment to find the one you like best and set it to that and it'll work in that mode until you change it. The entire set is weatherproof, so you can safely use these outdoors regardless of weather conditions. You can't daily chain these solar light sets though, so each strand requires it's own solar panel.LED lights don't get hot like incandescent bulbs do, so these beautiful starfish lights are safe to use indoors or outdoors. You can decorate trees and bushes out in your yard, use them on your porch railings, inside to frame a window, or anywhere you want as long as the solar panel can be placed in direct sunlight to charge.Solar string lights are easy to use and make things look festive, so they're wonderful to use when decorating for Christmas, New Year's, birthday parties, or any special occasion. I love string lights and this set of solar LED starfish lights is exceptionally pretty, so it's an easy recommend. Enjoy!This set of multicolored solar string lights was provided by Heartybay for evaluation and review. I hope that my inspection and observations about it prove helpful with your decision making.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8OD21AQJS9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XSYJ6I#wasThisHelpful","R1I8OD21AQJS9H","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:38 MinsMy daughter constantly misplaces her car keys, mail box keys, cell phone, and well, you name it, so I put a key holder in the hall by the garage. Naturally, she forgets to hang her keys on it, so several days a week we frantically hunt for her keys so she can get to school on time, and it drives us all batty!This wireless key finder is wonderful! Ever since we attached a receiver to her keys we've been able to relax and enjoy our mornings again. All she needs to do to find her keys nowadays is to press the color on the transceiver that corresponds to the color of the receiver on her keys and follow the beeping sound till she locates them. She left them in her jeans pocket yesterday and we traced them to the laundry room where we found them buried under a pile of towels in the hamper!This kit comes with everything you need to start using it except you'll need to have 2 AAA batteries for the transceiver which are not included. It comes with the transceiver, a stand for it, four battery powered receivers, the coin cell batteries for the receivers, 4 small key ring attachments, and 4 adhedsive pads. Once you've installed the batteries in the transceiver, open the back case of one of the receivers by using a small coin (I used a penny).  Insert the battery into the receiver, then touch the corresponding color on nthe transceiver for a moment to pair it up. Now you're ready to attach it to your keys (or whatever) and use it.Whenever you can't located the keys or whatever item you have the receiver on you can push the color coded button on the transceiver and the receiver will emit a loud beeping sound for about 10 seconds and then stop. You can push the botton again to make it beep more often and even walk around the house with it until you hear the beeping and find the item. It has a range of about 100 unobstructed feet and it even has a small flashlight beam that comes in handy when trying to find keys or other small items that may have fallen into dark places.I like the fact that the transceiver is smaller than my TV remote, so I could easily pack and take this when I travel to keep track of items such as my camera or purse. I'm going to use the other three to put one on my keys and my daughter's mail box key and the small wallet she carries inside her purse. You could use the peel and stick adhesive to put one on the cell phone or TV remote, but I think it's way too bulky to work well for either of those items and will hope a small thin version comes out eventually. I think it's terrific for keys and other items you can clip it to or dangle it from though, so I'm very pleased to recommend it on Amazon.

"My daughter gave me a battery operated LED candle last year, but it's nowhere near as realistic looking or feeling as this dancing flame LED candle is. This one has a real paraffin shell so it looks and feels like a genuine candle because it  basically is one, except for the fact that it runs on batteries and the 'flame' is an LED light so there's no fire risk, smoke or melting wax to worry about.Measuring 7"" high by 3.25 around, this candle runs on 3 AAA batteries (not included), and it has a floating plastic 'flame"" that sways in the air current reflecting the light from the LED light. The gentle movement of the floating plastic flame gives this candle the flickering effect of a real candle and it's the most realistic looking 'flame' that I've ever seen a flameless candle produce so far.This candle features the choice of manually turning it on and off, or setting it to timer mode. The timer mode sets the candle to run automatically for five hours a day starting at whichever time you turned it to timer. So, for example, if you set it to ""timer"" at 8 pm, the candle will continue running until 1 am  and then turn off until 8 pm that evening when it will come on again for another five hours. Of course you can stop that mode at any time by switching back to off or regular manual ""on"" mode instead.With high quality batteries the candle should be able to operate for approximately 150 hours before needing new batteries, and the LED light inside the unit should last approximately 50,000 hours. The quality of batteries used and longer running time may reduce that of course, so if you plan to use it frequently or on timer mode rechargeable batteries would be the most cost effective way to go.Since the candle's shell is actually made of real paraffin you shouldn't place the candle too close to a fireplace, in direct sunlight, or other heat source because it could actually melt. This is simply a gorgeous candle that looks and feels like a real candle when lit. I love it and I think you will too, so I'm pleased to recommend it on Amazon. Enjoy!This flameless LED candle was provided at no cost for my evaluation and review.  I hope my video and comments help you make an informed decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PECI3QGVCZ1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OF1RR0#wasThisHelpful","R2PECI3QGVCZ1G","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:43 MinsI'm a vet with a back injury and a small woman at that, so ease of use is very important to me. This collapsible folding utility cart is very easy to use and it only weighs 22 pounds, so I'm able to get it out when I need it, use it to transport various things around my yard, and put it away again when I'm finished without hurting myself.It's only 8"" wide when collapsed, so it takes up a lot less space in my garage than a regular wheelbarrow does, and I really appreciate that it comes fully assembled so it's ready to use as soon as you take it from the box. Made of strong 600D polyester fabric and steel, the cart expands to 35.5"" long by 20"" wide and 23.6"" high when opened and has a carrying capacity of 150 pounds. It also has a telescoping handle that extends about 16"" above the cart which you can use upright or in pull mode, mesh pockets to hold small items, and wheels that turn 360 degrees so it's easy to roll around.I'm having the house painted at the moment, so I lent it to the painters who used it to move the paint from the front of the house to the back. Each bucket of paint weighs fifty pounds and they moved three buckets at a time for a total of 3 trips over a concrete, dirt, and grass without any problems. I have peach trees in my back yard so I look forward to being able to use this cart to harvest my peaches and transport them back to the house. It's going to make my job so much easier than carrying them by hand in shopping bags!As another reviewer pointed out, the wheels do not lock in place, so be careful if you pause to load or unload on an incline. You'll need to block the wheels with something or the cart could very well roll downhill. That also made it difficult for me to put the cover back on by myself, but it went on easily when someone else helped hold the cart for me so the lack of wheel locks makes it a two person job.Their point about storing it was accurate as well. I'm lucky that I have a wall storage system in my garage so I was able to hang the cart up on the wall when it will stay until the next time I need it, but if you are unable to hang it on the wall it's hard to store standing upright because the wheels may roll and it could fall, so it's probably best stored flat - or put two nails up on the garage wall and hang it up. Otherwise, it seems to be well made and it's useful, especially for transporting items around the yard on level ground.This cart was provided at no cost for my evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAHPVI2KSJ7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012R88HTI#wasThisHelpful","R1QAHPVI2KSJ7T","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:45 MinsCrafted from the soft acrylic material, this sweater features an argyle design that looks adorable on my dog. My dog is a 12 pound Silky Terrier so it's often difficult to get a sweater that fits him perfectly because Silky's have long bodies.The size medium fit over his neck and legs nicely and I can insert two fingers between the neck & sweater without a problem.  The length of the back could be a little longer in my opinion, but then again Silky's are hard to fit perfectly and this comes very close to being just right.The sweater is well made and just about the right thickness to help keep him warm this winter and he seems to be comfortable with it on, so I'm pleased with it. It's difficult to buy clothes for ourselves or our dogs without being able to try them on first, so I definitely recommend you measure yours dog's neck, chest, and the length of the back before selecting what size to get.

" 4:31 MinsI love diffusing essential oils throughout my home for the lovely aromas as well as the health benefits, so when I was offered the opportunity to test this 400ml model by Airomatik I gladly accepted. This diffuser comes fully assembled and ready to use with an easy to understand manual, so I was able to have it operating within minutes of unboxing it.Its 400 ml capacity is larger than most other diffusers which allows this diffuser to run longer and need less frequent refills. In fact, if filled to capacity and set to the low mist settng, this diffuser can run for up to 8 and shut itself off when it detects low water volume, so I could set it up in the evening and it will run till morning without me having to worry about it. Although there was no measuring cup included with this diffuser, the maximum fill line is clearly marked in black on the tank so be sure you don't fill above that level.This diffuser is in a cube shape and I did find it a bit difficult to remove the top. I got my fingernails under the edge on opposite sides and managed to pop it up, and I hope it loosens up a little so it becomes easier to do over time. It has three mist settings, the first of which automatically begins once you press the power button. I didn't see or feel much mist in this lowest setting, so I used the ""range"" button which adjusts the mist level and tried the second highest level, and finally the highest setting. The second highest setting produced a discernable amounf of mist, but it took the highest setting to produce a generous amount of mist (so this is the setting I would prefer).The diffuser also has 7 main light settings with a wide variety of shades and intensity within the colors as well, so you can choose to let the lights cycle through colors in a continual loop, or you can press the ""light"" mode button once again to remain on a color. You can also operate the diffuser without the lights if you prefer (although the green power light will still be on).  I found it interesting that the diffuser can be powered off but the lights remain on until you power them off. I also turned the lights on but left the diffuser power off so apparently you can use the unit for the colorful lights alone if desired.Overall this is a nice diffuser, but I'd prefer to see some things different at this price point:1. I wish the top was easier to remove2. It should come with a measuring cup3. I'd like to see a bit more mist produced in the first two mist settings than it does4. The manual is easy to understand but there's no mention of coverage area providedTherefore I am giving this unit 4 stars rather than 5.This aromatherapy diffuser was purchased at a discounted price for evaluation and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2GLFZJC7ZF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ITWBLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3V2GLFZJC7ZF7","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:46 MinsThis is a good looking pair of men's slippers with soft brushed microsuede uppers, soft cushiony lining, and well cushioned insoles.

This collapsible folding utility cart is very easy to use and it only weighs 22 pounds, so I'm able to get it out when I need it, use it to transport various things around my yard, and put it away again when I'm finished without hurting myself.It's only 8"" wide when collapsed, so it takes up a lot less space in my garage than a regular wheelbarrow does, and I really appreciate that it comes fully assembled so it's ready to use as soon as you take it from the box. Made of strong 600D polyester fabric and steel, the cart expands to 35.5"" long by 20"" wide and 23.6"" high when opened and has a carrying capacity of 150 pounds. It also has a telescoping handle that extends about 16"" above the cart which you can use upright or in pull mode, mesh pockets to hold small items, and wheels that turn 360 degrees so it's easy to roll around.I'm having the house painted at the moment, so I lent it to the painters who used it to move the paint from the front of the house to the back. Each bucket of paint weighs fifty pounds and they moved three buckets at a time for a total of 3 trips over a concrete, dirt, and grass without any problems. I have peach trees in my back yard so I look forward to being able to use this cart to harvest my peaches and transport them back to the house. It's going to make my job so much easier than carrying them by hand in shopping bags!As another reviewer pointed out, the wheels do not lock in place, so be careful if you pause to load or unload on an incline. You'll need to block the wheels with something or the cart could very well roll downhill. That also made it difficult for me to put the cover back on by myself, but it went on easily when someone else helped hold the cart for me so the lack of wheel locks makes it a two person job.Their point about storing it was accurate as well. I'm lucky that I have a wall storage system in my garage so I was able to hang the cart up on the wall when it will stay until the next time I need it, but if you are unable to hang it on the wall it's hard to store standing upright because the wheels may roll and it could fall, so it's probably best stored flat - or put two nails up on the garage wall and hang it up. Otherwise, it seems to be well made and it's useful, especially for transporting items around the yard on level ground.This cart was provided at no cost for my evaluation and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322VDPV4LRCJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162UKR0E#wasThisHelpful","R322VDPV4LRCJP","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:22 MinsConstructed of sturdy canvas with a stylish birds in flight motif, this adorable girl's backpack is well complimented by brown PU leather trim and brass hardware.  Measuring 15"" high by 11"" across, this is a roomy top loading bag that features both a drawstring closure option as well as a fold-over lid with snap closure.The majority of this bag's storage space is found in its fully lined main compartment which provides enough space to easily accommodate several books plus a full sized iPad. The liner is a free floating dark brown nylon which I personally like because it won't show pen marks and will stay clean looking longer than a lighter color would. The front wall of the main compartment has a pocket to hold a cell phone, and the rear wall has a 6"" across by 5"" deep zippered storage compartment.Unfortunately, there is no padding along the back wall of the main compartment to cushion the wearer's back from books, laptops ,or any other hard objects inside the pack.The front of the bag also has an approximately 8.5"" across by 6"" deep compartment with a fold over flap that snaps closed, and the sides of the bag each have a 6"" across by 6.5"" deep compartment with a fold over flap that snaps closed. The bag's bottom is fully reinforced with PU leather.The back of the bag has a PU Leather carry/hanging loop affixed to the upper portion, a strip of PU leather sewn in at the juncture of the lid, carry straps, and hanging loop which reinforces all of the stress points, and the two carry straps. The carry straps have PU leather on the outside and nylon mesh on the inner side and adjust to a maximum of 30"".The stitching throughout the bag appears to be tight and well done, with reinforced stitching at all the pressure points, and all of the zippers operated smoothly. I like the bag a lot, especially it's appearance, but I'm not sure it's suitable as a book bag as it is because of the lack of padding to cushion the wearer's back.  Despite that, I do think the bag is very cute. I think it would be great as a carry on bag when traveling, a day bag, or as a sleep over bag and would be pleased to recommend it for those uses.I purchased this girl's backpack at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion. I hope that my inspection and observations about it prove helpful with your decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJZNJXXR5WG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CYIV3W#wasThisHelpful","RRJZNJXXR5WG1","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made of high quality and durable zinc alloy, this wall mounted bottle opener has a nice solid feel to it, and it comes with four matching screws so it feels very secure once it's mounted.I decided to mount it on the side of our kitchen island where it will be very convenient to use to when we entertain company. The classic style and brushed antique nickel look compliments our kitchen beautifully!Having a wall mounted bottle opener means I don't have to go rummaging through drawers trying to find the bottle opener each time we serve beer, and it's easy to open bottles with it. I also plan on putting one of these in my pool house. It looks good, is very well made, and sure is convenient to have, so I'm pleased to recommend it on Amazon.I purchased this bottle opener at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQO01VXJL95L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170WFBJA#wasThisHelpful","R2DQO01VXJL95L","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I've used rose water as a facial toner for quite a while, I am very pleased with the delicate scent of this particular Rose Water by Regent Naturals. It feels very soothing on my face when I use it, and I like that it comes with a spray head so I don't need to waste any using a cotton ball to apply it.I enjoy using Rose Water as a facial toner because it's naturally rich in vitamins and antioxidants which helps to protect my skin from damage caused by the sun, and also helps repair damage that's already been done. It moisturizes and softens my skin, helps prevent wrinkles and tightens pores, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh, and with a delicate lingering scent of roses.Also, if you ever wake up with puffy eyes from allergies like I do, try chilling your bottle of Rose Water in the fridge for a half hour or so, then apply some to a cotton pad, close your eyes and place the pads on your eyelids. Relax for a little while and let the Rose Water's anti-inflammatory properties work to reduce the puffiness around your eyes.Besides it's usefulness as a wonderful toner, Rose Water works well, for removing makeup, to soothe your skin after shaving your legs, to add a touch of gloss to your hair, to add to your bath water, to spritz the sheets with, or to simply enjoy it as a fragrance.  This Rose water is 100% pure, organic, vegan, and Kosher Certified, so you could even use it in soap making, lotions, or skin creams.  I'm very happy with this product and plan to continue using it, so I'm pleased to recommend it on Amazon.Retail sample provided at no cost for my testing, evaluation, and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULSNWGD7O5WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017FQ23CE#wasThisHelpful","R2ULSNWGD7O5WX","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:30 MinsI love hanging toiletry bags for both travel and for taking to the gym. Of all the ones I've owned so far, this is by far the most spacious and I love that about it. I've owned some that wouldn't even fit my full sized comb, and none that I've had before could fit a regular sized brush before. As you can see, this bag fits both of them with plenty of room left over for a whole bunch more!Seeing the actual product usually helps me figure out whether it's what I'm looking for or not, so I packed the bag with items I might take along when traveling and made a brief video to give you an idea about how it actually looks and what it can hold. Since I had it loaded up and hanging, I wasn't able to show you the carry strap that's also on top of the bag, nor could I give you a view of the additional zippered compartment on the very front of the bag.  There are also full zippered storage compartments on the outside of both sides of the bag plus a full size open pouch on the back side of the bag as well! As you can see, this bag has LOTS of room to store stuff both inside it's main compartment and on the outside of the bag!This toiletry bag is very well made of a durable nylon material. The bag has plenty of mesh compartments to store even wet items, a metal hook to hang the bag over the shower rod, and zips securely closed when you're finished using it to keep moisture away from my other things in your luggage. The stitching is well sewn and reinforced at all stress points, and the zippers all operate smoothly.In addition to being excellent quality, the spaciousness of this hanging toiletry bag makes it very useful for travel. I like it and plan to use it on my trip to Italy to see my family next week. If you're looking for a well made spacious hanging toiletry bag, look no further because you've found it. Enjoy!I purchased this travel toiletry bag at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.

" 2:03 MinsWhenever I've tried recording my granddaughter singing using my iPhone the sound quality is distant, muffled, and generally pretty awful. I tested this Lavalier Clip-on Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone by SoulBay using both the iPhone and my iPad and the difference in clarity is like night and day.The improvement is more marked with the iPhone, but I think the sound quality was improved quite a bit on the iPad as well. I made a short video using both the iPad's built-in microphone and this lapel mic to give you an idea about its sound quality, and you can judge for yourself which sounds better.This clip on lapel microphone is compatible with Apple iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Android & Windows Smartphones. It's truly plug and play ready, has a gold TRRS 3.5 mm jack to ensure top sound quality, and it doesn't require any special Apple to Android Conversion Cable.  It comes with a nice soft storage case, a wind muff, a metal lapel clip, and an extra long 59"" cord which makes it perfect for filming interviews.It's small, very lightweight, has a long cord, and can clip onto an article of clothing so it's great for recording in an auditorium, a classroom, newscast type recording, or whatever recording you need to do, and the Omnidirectional pickup offers splendid flexibility. This microphone is strictly designed for audio recording only though, so it doesn't work with Skype or other types of video chatting.The bottom line is that this clip-on lapel microphone is compatible with most smart phones and iPads, is easy to use, lightweight and portable with an extra long cord for extended range, and produces clean and crisp sound, so I'm pleased to recommend it on Amazon.Retail sample was provided by SoulBay for my evaluation and review.I hope that my inspection and observations about it proves helpful with your decision making.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39G2ZMTOVRJU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014AAFRKI#wasThisHelpful","R39G2ZMTOVRJU2","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:04 MinsMade of high quality durable water resistant nylon, this lightweight packable cross body sling pack holds a surprising amount of stuff both inside it's triangular main chamber, and in the assorted zippered compartment and pouches along it's outside.What's really cool about this bag is the way it folds up into a small zippered pouch when you're not using it, so it's easy to pack in your luggage when traveling and it doesn't take up much space or weight. When you do want to use it for a daytrip, trip to a theme park, to the gym, hiking, or whatever, you just unzip the pouch, pull it out, and within mere moments you have a fully assembled sling bag ready to use.The bag's main compartment easily holds a towel, compact umbrella, camera, wallet, water bottles, and keys with some room left over for a souvenir or two, and that's not even counting the triangle shaped pouch on the back, the cell phone holder in the shoulder strap, or the water bottle holder on the side. As I said, this bag holds an amazing amount of gear!This cross body sling bag is a great alternative to a fanny pack when on vacation or a visit to a theme park.  There's a hook at the top of the pouch to hook it to a belt or backpack when used for camping or hiking, and the bag is actually quite comfortable to wear. The bag is versatile, very useful, durable and easy to wipe clean and fold back into a pouch when you're done using it, so I really like it and am pleased to recommend it on Amazon.Retail sample was provided for my evaluation and review.

" 3:59 MinsCompact and portable with an ergonomically shaped hand grip, this handheld Digital Wind Speed Measuring Device measures wind speed, minimum and maximum wind speed, temperature, wind chill, and average wind speed, and includes backlighting for use in low light conditions.The device comes with two pre-installed AAA batteries, but you will need to open the battery case in the rear of the device, remove the plastic from them, and then reinstall them in order to use the unit. The screws that hold the battery case are extremely tiny, so please note that you are going to need a tool with a very small head to open and close them.The anemometer is simple to use once the batteries are installed. Just push the red power button which automatically begins reading wind speed, then push the appropriate buttons on the front to switch between units of measure (mph, Km/hr, m/s, Ft/min or Knots), temperature units of measure (degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius), temperature and wind chill, average, current and maximum wind speed, and to activate the backlight for the display. One thing I wish this anemometer included that it doesn't is wind direction, but other than that, I tested every function that it does include with exception of wind chill as it wasn't cold enough to test that function. Everything that I could test seems to  work as intended.Very easy to use. All functions are easy to access and use, so I'm pleased to recommend it on Amazon.Retail sample was provided for my evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7L827XFPY7MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01762P77K#wasThisHelpful","R7L827XFPY7MO","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This arcrylic paint set by Alto Crafto includes twelve 12 ml aluminum tubes of brilliant lightfast colors which work well on multiple surfaces such as art paper, wood, canvas, fabric, or for nail art.  The set includes a wide selection of colors which blend effortlessly to provide plenty of room for creative expression, and since these are going to be used by my little granddaughter, I feel better knowing that they're completely free of toxic materials and chemicals.The set comes with Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Medium Yellow, Brilliant Red, Crimson, Phthalo Blue, Blue Lake, Light Green, Phthalo Green, Yellow Ochre, Burnt Sienna, and  Mars Black. My granddaughter made a color chart so you could see how the actual paint colors look on art paper and I've attached it below.These acrylic paints flows on smoothly when brushed, and the color saturation is beautiful. Acrylic paint's are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry. Cleaning up brushes and paint on hands just requires warm soapy water and a rinse. This is a nice starter set for a child or budding artist, so I'm pleased to recommend them on Amazon.I purchased this acrylic paint set at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.

" 2:45 MinsI'm an avid essential oil user and love diffusing different oils for their various health benefits and simply to enjoy the aroma throughout my house. This is an attractive diffuser that stands about 6.5"" tall and puts out a generous enough amount of cool mist that is just about right for a bedroom (269 square feet). It reminds me of one I saw at a spa I like to go to in town and it's relaxing to me to watch the lovely lights colors change.This diffuser has a 100ml capacity and can run for about four hours before needing refilling. Just fill the included measuring cup with warm tap water, remove the top of the diffuser and pour the water into the reservoir staying below the clearly marked maximum line. Add 3 - 5 drops of your favorite essential oil, replace the lid, plug the diffuser in and then press and hold the mist button until the green light turns on and the diffuser will begin to dispense a generous amount of cool mist from the vent in the top side.The diffuser has two mist settings, and the second press of the mist button will switch the output to the higher setting which dispenses even more cool mist from the vent. I really like the fact that the mist outlet is positioned on the upper side of the diffuser rather than in the middle of the top as so many others do. That means I can direct where the mist goes to get the optimal amount of therapeutic mist where I want it. It also means you can direct it away from food items or other things you don't want the mist falling on as well.The diffuser also has a light button beside the mist button, and once pushed it starts to scroll through seven very pretty colors. You can allow it to continuously scroll through the various colors, or you can press the button again to select a color to stay on, or you can press and hold the button to turn the lights off if you wish.It's very simple to use, almost silent except for the gentle sound of water bubbling, and very relaxing too. I love that it automatically shuts off when the water level gets too low so I can set it up, start it and not worry about it. There is a green power light that remains on while the unit operates, so you may want to cover that with a piece of tape if you want total darkness.The only negative to the unit is a beep that it makes when it shuts off, so take that into consideration if you have it on a night stand and you are an extremely light sleeper. Otherwise, it's well made, puts out a generous amount of mist, runs a long time before needing a refill, and it's easy to use. Be sure to only use pure essential oils in it and clean the water tank every now & then and it should last a long time. Enjoy!Retail sample provided at no cost for my testing, evaluation, and review. I hope that my inspection and observations about the diffuser prove helpful with your decision making.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF348AD94WMEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SWSAGO#wasThisHelpful","RF348AD94WMEN","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:03 MinsThis is a versatile set of two different sized insulated lunch bags made of durable canvas with a modest amount of insulation on the inside and a Pu leather carry handle. They come flattened in plastic bags, and they have a slight odor that dissipates once allowed to air out for a few days.The small bag measures approximately 5""Lx5""Hx8""Across, and the large bag measures approximately 6""Lx6""Hx10"" Across, and both appear to be well sewn with zippers that function well. The inside of each bag is fully lined in a moderate amount of that silver colored insulation material which will help keep your hot foods hot & cold foods cold for a few hours. Both are easily cleaned by wiping down with a soft damp cloth.Despite looking very small, the smaller of the two bags holds a surprising amount of stuff. I made a short video to demonstrate what it could hold, but in case you can't see videos, I'll give you a clue - it can hold a LOT.  The small bag can easily accommodate a full size sandwich in a plastic container, a drink, and snacks.  The large lunch bag fits eight standard 12 oz cans of soda, so it's actually big enough to act as a small cooler.Having two different sizes like these make it possible to use the smaller one for foods and the larger for drinks, or vice versa. You could also use the larger one as a cooler to hold water or other drinks when on an outing for the day with the kids, or use the larger one for food and the smaller one to hold medicines that need to remain chilled. As you can see, having both bags offers a lot of possibilities.  I also like the fact that when they aren't needed they can be wiped clean and stored flat until the next time you need them.  Overall, they seem useful and well made. Enjoy!Retail sample was provided for my evaluation and review. I hope that my observations prove helpful with your decision making.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIAGHAEHU7H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHKWCP4#wasThisHelpful","RQIAGHAEHU7H5","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I open the door between the house and garage there's a concrete step down to the garage floor.  Unfortunately the light switch for the garage is about four feet further along the wall past the step, so I was very glad to have been offered this motion sensor light for testing and review because it's exactly what I needed to provide lighting to be able to see that step!This motion sensor light is extremely simple to set up and start using. Just twist the top open and insert 3 AAA batteries (not included) into the slots inside, then replace the cap and twist it closed again.  Peel off one side of the double sided 3M tape that's included and stick it to the back of the light. Decide where you want to place the light and peel the other side of the 3M tape off and stick the light to the wall.The motion sensor detects movement several feet out and comes on automatically casting ample light around itself to illuminate the surrounding area well enough that I could easily see the steps, the light switches and all around, making it safe for me to step down into the garage. Once you move far enough away from the light it will go off in about 10 seconds thus conserving it's battery life. Since the light itself is LED you won't need to worry about replacing bulbs either.That's it -- no wiring needed, so you can put it wherever you need to. This is wonderful for lighting around stairways or steps, in closets, pantries, basements, or literally anywhere you want some extra light.  I'm very pleased with it's quality and the amount of light it produces, and I plan to buy more of them at full price for various spots around my house. Great motion sensing light, so I'm glad to recommend it on Amazon.This motion sensor light was provided by URPOWER for evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TSFZH9L8KY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016O9EXYE#wasThisHelpful","R36TSFZH9L8KY6","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:16 MinsThis is an elegant looking Men's Quartz watch with a sleek black day date dial, stainless case, crown, stem, markers, and a stainless pilot style bracelet with hidden deployment clasp. It looks like it would cost much more than it actually does, and it has that classic style that looks so good with either casual clothes or business suits.This watch features a  Mineral Crystal which is second only to sapphire crystal, and is much more scratch resistant than the acrylic crystals more commonly found on watches at this price point. This watch also features a Japanese Miyota quartz movement which is made by Citizen, and they have an excellent reputation for reliability and accuracy.This watch features the days of the week in both Spanish and English and you can choose which language to set it to and it will hold that setting. One thing you need to know about the day date feature on these types of watches is don't set them within two or three hours of noon or midnight. If you do, you will take a chance of ruining the function.The watch features a sporty stainless steep pilot's type bracelet with hidden deployment clasp which gives it a sleek look when worn, and the company even included a link removal tool so you can adjust the bracelet to fit your wrist without having to go to a jeweler. This watch is shock and water resistant to 99 feet, so it's safe to wear while in the rain, but isn't water proof. This watch comes in a nice watch box with pillow and an elegant gift bag, so it's perfect for gifting.This watch was provided by Burei for evaluation and review. This watch's movement, crystal, and strap are remarkable in such an affordably priced watch, so if you're looking for a watch that looks great and will be reliable, I am very pleased to recommend this one very highly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7FIE0EI659AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDPC4#wasThisHelpful","R7FIE0EI659AT","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:15 MinsTaking up only about as much space as a small can of coffee, this 300ml diffuser by URPOWER comes fully assembled and ready to use complete with measuring cup, power cord, and easy to understand manual, so I was able to have it operating within minutes of unboxing it.I know it's hard to buy something sight unseen online, so I made a short video to try and show you some of this diffuser's features and give you a real world look at  how it looks and sounds when running.  Here are some of my observations about it:Its 300 ml capacity is larger than most other diffusers and it allows this diffuser to run longer and need less frequent refills. In fact, if filled to capacity and set to ""on"", this diffuser can run for 8 to 10 hours and shut itself off when it detects low water volume, so I could set it up in the evening and it will run till morning without me having to worry about it.I could also set it up in the morning before leaving for work and come home to a nice smelling house and probably find the diffuser still working too. In addition to being nice to have at home, the ability to run so long also makes this diffuser an excellent choice for a beauty salon, a spa, a small office, or any sort of business as well.In fact, in addition to functioning as an aromatherapy diffuser, this diffuser is a multifunctional device that can also function as a room humidifier, an air purifier, an ionizer, or as a night light.The top of this diffuser is a little different from any I've tested before it in that you need to twist it to take it off and twist slightly to line up the dots correctly when putting it back on. This makes it slightly more difficult to accomplish than one that just lifts on and goes straight down, so you do have to be careful not to tip the diffuser when removing or replacing the lid so you don't spill anything.Other than the slightly more cumbersome twisting of the lid, the other features are straightforward and easy to operate. Use the measuring cup that's included to fill the water tank with water that doesn't go over the uppermost fill mark, add 3 - 5 drops of essential oil per 100ml - or more for stronger aroma, and less for a weaker concentration, set the time between your choice 60 mins, 180 mins, 360 mins or ON, and begin diffusing. The diffuser has a built in auto-shut off safety feature that will turn it off when it senses low water level.  I really like the fact that it diffuses from the side rather than straight up though, because that way I can aim the mist where I want it go.The diffuser also has 7 main light settings with a wide variety of shades and intensity within the colors as well, so you can choose to let the lights cycle through colors in a continual loop, or select one color to remain on and even choose the shade and intensity of that particular color by pressing the light button quickly once you see the color of your choice.  You can set one color to low intensity to function as a night light, or you can choose to turn the lights off entirely.This diffuser does have a few quirks that some people might find annoying however:1. There is a small green power light that shines whenever the diffuser is powered on, so if you want it to run without any lights you may want to tape over the power light.2.  It also beeps twice before it shuts off which may be bothersome for very light sleepers.Otherwise however, this is a beautiful and well made aromatherapy diffuser that runs quietly and puts out a generous amount of fine cool mist for up to 10 hours, and I really like it.This diffuser was provided at no cost for evaluation and review. I hope that my inspection and observations about it prove helpful with your decision making. If you have questions about the diffuser just post them in the comments section, and I'll do my best to answer based on my own experience with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83VA267CLM2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153IMOZW#wasThisHelpful","R83VA267CLM2Y","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:11 MinsConstructed of sturdy canvas, this adorable girl's backpack has a beautiful art deco floral print on the front that goes well with the khaki colored pockets, straps, and back.  Measuring 15.75"" high, this is a roomy top loading bag that features both a fold-over lid that snaps down as well as a drawstring closure option.The majority of this bag's storage space is found in its fully lined main compartment which provides plenty of usable storage space. On the front wall of the main compartment are two open pouches that could hold a cell phone and another gadget, with a small space to hold pens between them. The rear of the compartment has a zippered compartment approximately 8"" long by 7"" deep, and finally there is a reinforcement panel for the pack's bottom.* Unfortunately, there is no padding along the back wall of the main compartment to cushion the wearer's back from books, laptops ,or any other hard objects inside the pack. Also, the bag is wider at the base than at the top with the top opening being just 10.5"" in total width, so it does make it more cumbersome to add or remove wider books or a laptop easily. Suggestion for the manufacturer - install a 3/4 length zipper along one side to allow for side access to the main compartment, and also install some padding in the back wall of the main compartment.There are three 5""x5"" storage compartments on the lower front part of the bag; two with snap closure, and one with Velcro closure.  The back of the bag has another zippered compartment approximately 7"" across by 6"" tall, and then it has two 2"" wide adjustable straps.  The stitching throughout the bag appears to be tight and well done, with reinforced stitching at all the pressure points, and canvas is very durable, so this bag should last a nice long time.I like the bag a lot, especially it's appearance, but I'm not sure it's suitable as a book bag as it is because of the narrow top opening and lack of padding to cushion the wearer's back.  It's also way too pretty to take out to the woods camping!  This is perfect for my granddaughter to wear as her carry on bag when traveling though, and it will also make a wonderful sleepover bag to carry her clothes and stuffed animals in when she sleeps over a girlfriend's houses, so that's what I plan to do with the bag.

" 2:20 MinsThis gaming keyboard makes my Logitech one look so boring, and it is in comparison! This is a cool looking entry level gaming keyboard with some very useful features in addition to some fun ones.I really like the black color and think it works well with the red accents, multimedia keys, and braided USB cord. It has an edgy non-slip front edge that's a bit too angled for my liking, but to my surprise I found it to be comfortable to use when the keyboard is adjusted to rest at an angle. The USB cord is long enough to easily reach the back of my computer to plug in discretely, and it seems well made.The keyboard offers seven different backlight colors that can be selected by pressing the FN+scrlk key, and there's even a pulse selection if you want flashing backlights. The lights will go off after about 3 to 5 minutes of inactivity, but you can press any key to reactivate them. They default to green, but you can cycle to get to the color you prefer and then use the FN+PaUp to make them brighter, or FN+PaDn to make them more dim.There are 8 red colored multimedia keys at the top of the board so they're easy to see and use for quick access to browser, mail and more.  I like the smooth functioning keys which you tap more like a typewriter and offer a similar click. They operated easily and without any sticking, and I believe they provide for a bit more precision than keys that are so touch sensitive that you barely brush it and it registers. Oh, and in case you press 19 keys together the instruction sheet says it won't cause any conflict. In fact, it says it will supposedly ""make game more fast"".If you flip the keyboard over, you'll find there are two pop up legs that allow you to set the keyboard at an angle, and there are also drain holes in case something gets spilled. I can think of a couple of times that would have come in handy for me!  If you're a seasoned hard core gamer, this probably isn't what you're looking for. If on the other hand you're looking for a cool multimedia keyboard that can handle gaming as well, then this one will probably be just right for you.I purchased this keyboard at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL70C4TDBKY2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBSYWH0#wasThisHelpful","RL70C4TDBKY2A","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I use many essential oils on a daily basis, I had never heard of Helichrysum before being offered a bottle of it to review. Getting to try something new is always fascinating, so I was happy to get to try this.  I've spent some time studying it's uses and they are too numerous to list here, but let's just say it's very versatile!This oil is a yellowish color, thin, and has a strong scent that's hard to describe- sort of like fresh straw, but fruity and kind of sweet too. Not at all unpleasant but powerful.  This oil has strong antibiotic and antimicrobial properties that make it a great natural cure for acne that works without drying the skin or causing redness and other unwanted side effects. Since my daughter has troubles with acne  now & then I suggested that she try it out, and she has been for the past week with good results. Those several spots she had on her face have subsided, and hopefully this may help reduce the number of new ones.I also read that helichrysum oil decreases muscle pain by lowering swelling, inflammation and improving circulation. When mixed with a carrier oil and massaged into sore muscles and joints it's supposed to be an effective natural treatment for pain related symptoms of arthritis, fibromyalgia and exercise-related injuries. You can use it along with lavender oil, which is also excellent to reduce pain and emotional stress.This Helichrysum essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim. It comes in a 10ml size dark amber glass bottle with a built-in Euro-dropper cap which helps you measure out the number of drops you want without any waste. I'm intrigued by it's many uses, so I am pleased to recommend it on Amazon.Retail sample provided at no cost by Natural Acres for my testing, evaluation, and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12S5ZVEWONSQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RJ3Q5Y#wasThisHelpful","R12S5ZVEWONSQ8","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something about the scent of Cedar that puts me in a serene and relaxed state of mind whenever I diffuse it, so I was very pleased to receive a bottle of Cedar Wood essential Oil from Natural Acres to review.  I've been doing some reading to learn the many ways this oil is used and am amazed to learn how versatile and useful it is.It turns out that Cedarwood Essential Oil is used to treat Seborrheic Eczema, is safe to apply on wounds as an antiseptic, reduces painful joint inflammations such as arthritis, reduces muscle spasms, strengthens the grip of gums on teeth, and as an insecticide.  When used in vaporizers, it drives away mosquitoes, flies and other insects in a large area around the house, and when spritzed onto pillows it can keep mosquitoes and flies away while you sleep.Please note: Unlike some essential oils, cedarwood oil cannot be ingested in any quantity. It is a highly potent oil, and can cause vomiting, nausea, and thirst, and extensive damage to the digestive system.This Cedarwood essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim. It comes in a 10ml size dark amber glass bottle with a built-in Euro-dropper cap which helps you measure out the number of drops you want without any waste.

"I have a child with ADD who is having a hard time concentrating when she studies, so I was very happy to be given a bottle of Basil essential oil by Natural Acres to review.  When diffused Basil oil helps reduce anxiety and promote focus, so I'm starting to diffuse it while she does her homework.If diffusing it as she does homework seems to be helpful, then I'll get her one of those adorable diffuser necklaces so she can have some to inhale at school too. One downside about basil is the aroma makes me hungry though! I'm sure you're familiar with the scent from using it in cooking, but in case you aren't, the fragrance is sort of warm, herbal, and minty.I also read that Basil oil is a natural muscle relaxer, so I mixed some drops along with some spearmint oil in fractionated coconut oil and massaged some into my sore neck muscles. It smelled fantastic, but more importantly it felt cooling and soothing, so I plan to continue using it as needed whenever I'm achy.This Basil essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.

"Of all the essential oils on the market, Peppermint oil is the one I use the most of around the house, so I was delighted to be given a bottle by Natural Acres to review.  Besides having a wonderful aroma that brings happy thoughts of Christmas to mind, Peppermint essential oil is my go to agent for keeping my house free of yucky spiders and mice!Yep, the creepy crawly things despise Peppermint oil so I make a spray to spritz thresholds, windowsills, and dark corners behind appliances on a weekly basis.  I also wet cotton balls with some and place them at the corners of my garage doors to help keep mice out and it really does work so, so if you have spiders or other issues give Peppermint oil a try.Every time the seasons change I seem to come down with a cold and last year it turned into bronchitis. I've learned that I could add some drops of peppermint oil to boiling water and inhale the steam to clear up congestion, clogged sinuses, and fight off a cold faster, so I'll definitely be giving that a try next time I get sick.  You can also add a few drops of it along with some drops of eucalyptus oil to a carrier oil to make a chest rub to help relieve congestion, so I plan to try that too.This Peppermint essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.

I couldn't resist blending it with Frankincense and diffusing the blend to see what they were like together. I love the aroma of Frankincense oil by itself, but I have to admit adding the drops of Myrrh took it to an entirely new dimension and it was fabulous!I've read that Myrrh is known to enhance mental clarity, and as hectic as my life is these days I'll gladly accept all of the help it might give me in that department. I also learned that Myrrh is supposed to be wonderful for curing chapped hands and lips when mixed with a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba oil, so with winter coming I plan to give it a try since I always get badly chapped lips every winter.This Myrrh essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.

"Despite the labeling on the package and the tag on the product, these cloths are not genuine Japanese Salux Cloths, and they don't feel as good.  They're close to the original, but thinner and with a looser weave so they feel more scratchy when used.  I'm adding a photo below of what the girl's picture looks like on the genuine Salux product so you can see what the genuine product package looks like.I located the counterfeit ones being sold here and passed as genuine Salux cloths on Alibaba and if you do a search there you can find them as well and will see that they match the product being sold on this page. The ones listed on Alibaba look exactly like the ones in this product listing - same packaging, same ""Made in Japan"" markings and same picture of the girl - but the listing says they're made by GUAGUALUO in Gua, China.These pseudo-Salux cloths do foam up nicely and they don't feel awful when using them, but they also don't feel as good as the genuine ones do either.

"You might wonder why anyone who has a way to boil water would need an electric egg cooker. I wouldn't blame you for the question because it's one I asked myself - before I tried this product.  Now that I've tried it, I can tell you why I think it's worthwhile - it makes perfect easy to peel hard boiled eggs every single time I use it!Actually the egg cooker can make perfectly cooked soft, medium, or hard boiled eggs depending on your preference and steams them to perfection without your having to stick around to monitor the process.  I love making deviled eggs, but hate it when I tear the egg when peeling it. That isn't a problem with this egg cooker because you pierce the eggs before starting to steam them. For some reason, piercing the egg prevents it from cracking during cooking and makes the shell super easy to peel cleanly off after they cool, leaving you with perfect looking boiled eggs.To make soft, medium, or hard boiled eggs in this egg cooker:1. Fill the measuring cup that came with the cooker to the line marked for soft, medium, or hard boiled eggs (depending on the type you want to make), then pour the water into the water holding tray.2. Place the plastic egg holder tray onto the cooker positioned above the water tray.3. Using the pin at the bottom of the plastic measuring cup pierce the bottom of an egg (THE LARGEST PART OF THE EGG) with the pin4. Place the pierced egg PIERCED SIDE UP into the egg holder tray5. repeat steps 3 & 4 until you have the number of eggs you want to cook in the tray (up to 7)6. Place the lid on the cooker7. Select soft, medium, or hard boiled and move the dial to that position (refer to manual for diagram if necessary)8. Plug cooker in and move rocker switch to ""ON"" position.9. Wait until cooking is finished10. Remove eggs once cooking is finished and immerse immediately in cold water to stop cooking process11. Eggs are now ready to top, peel, and eat!Easy to use, safely turns off when done, and easy clean up by wiping dry with a paper towel.  It took me a few tries to get it just right, but now that I have the eggs are coming out beautifully and they are super easy to peel this way. The first time I tried cooking the eggs I pierced the top of the eggs though and egg oozed out through the hole and I made a mess of it, so use the larger end and that won't happen to you!I also figured out that this egg cooker makes ""poached eggs"" but they're different than what we're accustomed to so I didn't recognize it immediately, but then it came to me - the ""medium hard boiled eggs"" are the same as poached eggs once you slice into them! So, to make eggs benedict set the egg cooker to medium hard boiled and then position the cooked egg over the Canadian Bacon on top of an English muffin half and slice the egg in half. Serve one half per half of the English muffin and top with Hollandaise as usual. Voila!This is a convenient way to make trouble free soft, medium, and hard boiled eggs that are cooked just right each time, and the eggs peel more easily and cleanly too so you can make beautiful presentations using this cooker.

"I was pleased to receive a bottle of Frankincense Essential Oil to review because I find its earthy and woodsy aroma sensual and arousing, and I love diffusing it in my bedroom. This Frankincense essential oil from Natural Acres is nice and clear colored, and it has the typical aroma that I find so very alluring.Frankincense essential oil added to facial cream does wonders for helping to reduce wrinkles and repair the damage the environment does to our skin, and you can even add some drops to water to make a toner. I've also read that Frankincense oil also has terrific anti-inflammatory properties, so adding a few drops to a carrier like Jojoba oil or coconut oil and then massaging arthritic joints will help provide relief.This Frankincense essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim. It comes in a 10ml size dark amber glass bottle with a built-in Euro-dropper cap which helps you measure out the number of drops you want without any waste. The aroma of this Frankincense oil is wonderful, so I will continue to use it and am pleased to recommend it on Amazon.Retail sample provided at no cost by Natural Acres for my testing, evaluation, and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15J7IQ6ABHAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RIZJ5U#wasThisHelpful","R15J7IQ6ABHAD","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleased to receive a bottle of Bergamot Essential Oil to review because I find its citrusy & floral scent very pleasant and relaxing. I've read that Bergamot is used in aromatherapy to help soothe nerves and reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, so I blended several drops of it together with some drops of lavender essential oil and diffused it on my night stand at bedtime. Did it reduce my stress level? I think so because I certainly found it's aroma soothing and I slept very well.  I've also diffused it in the living room and It makes my home smell heavenly and seems to lift everyone's mood as well.In addition to aromatherapy benefits, you can add a drop or two of Bergamot to your favorite skin care product for added cleansing properties, to balance your skin tone, and to help make scars and other marks less prominent. Bergamot can also stimulate and regenerate skin cells giving life to dull complexions, and it has powerful antiseptic and antibiotic properties that help remove the bacteria that can cause acne from our skin.*** Here's a very important fact about Bergamot that I read online:  Bergamot oil must be protected from sunlight, because bergaptene, one of its components, becomes poisonous if exposed to sunlight. That is why the oil should always be stored in dark bottles in dark places. Exposure to sunlight should even be avoided after it is applied or rubbed onto the skin, at least until it absorbs into your skin- and never apply it directly to your skin unless blended with a carrier oil like Fractionated Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil or other carrier.***This Bergamot essential oil is advertised as 100% pure therapeutic grade oil, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.

" 1:26 MinsThis is my 9 y/o granddaughter's first scooter and she loves it!  It looks great and it only needed one part inserted and tightened before using, so she was ready to try it within moments of it's arrival.  Despite being new to using a scooter, she's taken to it readily and is having a blast zipping around our circular driveway!I think this scooter offers some features that are helpful for her as a beginner, and will continue to be helpful as she gains in experience.  First of all, the scooter feels very stable, strong, and solidly built. There's nothing wobbly or loose, all of the welds look perfect, and it glides quietly and smoothly without any squeaks or rattles.The steel handlebar is triple clamped and provides good stability to support her movements, and the silicone hand grips have small ridges along their length that provide cushioning and also disperse perspiration which helps prevent her hands from slipping off as she rides. I like the fact that the polyurethane wheels have metal cores so I don't need to be concerned about them cracking, and they're equipped with high-speed bearings to ensure smooth execution during turns and maneuvers.The Fuzion X-5 Pro's sturdy aluminum deck is long and wide enough for her to use comfortably, and it's fully covered with deck grip tape which gives it a non-slip textured finish that helps her stay on. It also has squared edges to allow for hand grabs but she hasn't tested that because if I catch her trying to do hand stands while riding this scooter she's going to get a sore tush!  I love the rear step on brake that lets her slow herself down and stops the scooter so smoothly.This scooter looks fabulous, feels stable and well made, and operates smoothly and quietly.  My granddaughter helped me make a short video so you would be able to see the scooter for yourself in order to be able to better decide whether it's right for your needs or not.  My granddaughter loves it, and I'm very pleased with it's quality and performance. Enjoy!I purchased this scooter at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.

"I bought two of these 8 years ago and they're still functioning perfectly. Back then we were living in a coyote infested area of Arizona, and the concentrated beam and distance these lights put out allowed me to scan the perimeter of the back yard and surrounding area for coyotes to protect my pet dogs when I took them out at night.We've since moved to a rural area of Texas and the lights are still my favorites because sometimes I have to go outside in the dark to turn off a septic system alarm or take the dogs out, and I'll grab one of these to take with to light my way as well as check the meadows and woods around for anything out there.With the distance the light beam penetrates I think I'll be able to spot ""red eyes"" of any predators, and if not at least I can blind anything that gets too close long enough to make it safely back to my door. I also feel better knowing that this flashlight is long and sturdy enough for me to use it for self defense in certain situations as well.  The 7060 isn't inexpensive, but it's proven it's worth to me time after time, and it's still going strong.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it - and in fact, I thin I'm going to invest in one more this year to position in another spot in the house as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49RYOCPNXAWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019LEHVC#wasThisHelpful","R49RYOCPNXAWW","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought these for my 9 y/o granddaughter who just got a scooter and I'm very pleased with them. When they first came out of the package I was worried that they were going to be too large for her, but as you'll see in the photo I'm including they fit her wonderfully.I'm impressed by the attention to detail and degree of protection these pads offer for her knees and elbows. The soft mesh lining is comfortable for her to wear, the gel interior provides shock absorption, and the hard outer shell offers superior protection, and they're very well made so I believe they will last her for quite a while.  Highly recommend these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OIZ26Q9SFKPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000067QMK#wasThisHelpful","R1OIZ26Q9SFKPS","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:44 MinsThese My Busy Dog boots are adorable!  Hurricane Patricia is slated to make landfall and then head towards Texas, so they arrived just in time to get to try them out on one of my dogs before the rains hit us here, and it was hilarious watching him take his first steps in them. Like watching a dog trying to moonwalk! *lol*The important thing is that they do stay on him, but I think the size chart might be a bit off. I measured my 12# Silky Terrier's paws per the instructions and then ordered a size 4 accordingly, but they wouldn't stay on him for anything. Next I tried them on my Maltese-Westy mix who weighs about 18 - 20 pounds and they stay on him - but only if the Velcro is snugged down as tightly as possible around his foreleg. I hope those examples prove to be somewhat helpful as you try to order to correct size for your dog.I definitely like the boots. Besides being adorable looking on the dog, they're waterproof, have Velcro closures that let me fit them securely on his feet, and one of them is reflective which is always a nice safety feature. I love the rubber treaded non-slip soles best of all though because in my part of Texas we have terrible sticker burrs in the pasture grass that get stuck in my dog's paws and it's painful for them, so the soles of these boots will protect his paws from rain, mud, slipping, and sticker burrs! Hooray!I took a short video of his first experience wearing the boots so you could see how funny he looked walking in them, but it didn't take him very long at all after I shot the video for him to get used to them and go back to running around as usual.  It was funny though.  I like these boots and think they're well made. Just read people's reviews to find a pattern of which size boots work for what size dog before ordering.

" 2:17 MinsThis is a very well made universal stand for cell phones and tablets of up to 10"" that provides a secure way to hold the device in either portrait or landscape positions and allows for 270 degrees of rotation.Measuring a slim 4x3"" when collapsed, this stand is lightweight yet made of sturdy PVC and PE material that can support up to 11 pounds of weight.  It can be folded flat for tucking into luggage or a purse, or positioned into a plethora of different angles by adjusting the kickstand on the rear of the stand. The kickstand allows 270 degrees of rotation in 1 degree increments and securely locks into position where you want it anywhere from nearly flat to upright!I can't begin to describe how badly I needed this and how much I love it!  It's exactly what I needed to read in bed, and it's what my kids need in order to use their IPads more conveniently while doing their homework at the table.  This is going to really come in handy to prop my iPad up with when I'm reading a recipe while cooking, for reading or watching a movie in bed, and for taking along when I travel.I love the attention to detail such as the soft padding along the base that protects my devices from scratches, and the feet on the bottom to protect tables and other surfaces as well. This is a very solidly made stand that's stable on a variety of surfaces, small enough to easily carry along on a trip, offers protection for both my device and the surface it's set on, has multiple adjustment angles that lock in place, and is very affordable.You get a lot of bang for the buck with this universal tablet stand, and it works like a champ, so it's an easy recommend.

" 2:49 MinsThis is a gorgeous set of multicolored solar string lights that's 15.7' long with 20 red, gold, green, and blue raindrop shaped LED lights that put out enough bright colorful light to turn any occasion into a festive one. I love solar string lights because I can put them up virtually anywhere without worrying about outlets, and they don't cost me anything to run.This particular set comes with an attached solar panel that's pre-charged, but you should still stick it in full sun for about 6 hours to charge it fully before using it. Please be sure to peel the protective film off of the panel before placing it in the sun or it could melt onto the panel and reduce the efficiency.  The set comes with a two part plastic garden stake that you snap together and attach to the rear of the solar panel, and then you just place the panel in a location near where you want to install the lights and where you can get the most direct sunlight possible.There's a bit over 6' of cord between the solar panel and the first light which gives you a decent amount of room to place your panel and string the lights, and there's also about 5.5"" between each LED bulb. The set is photo sensing so you just set the panel to the on position and the lights will be off during the daylight and come on automatically at dusk. When the solar panel is fully charged the lights can stay on brightly for about 8 hours.There's a ""mode"" button on the back of the solar panel right next to the power button. These lights have 2 operating modes which include steady on and blinking. The entire set is weatherproof, so you can safely use these outdoors regardless of weather conditions. You can't daily chain these solar light sets though, so each strand requires it's own solar panel.LED lights don't get hot like incandescent bulbs do, so these are safe to use indoors or outdoors. You can decorate trees and bushes out in your yard, use them on your porch railings, inside to frame a window, or anywhere you want as long as the solar panel can be placed in direct sunlight to charge. Solar string lights are easy to use and make things look festive, so they're wonderful to use when decorating for Christmas, New Year's birthdays, or any special occasion.I love fairy lights and this set is no exception. It puts out a very nice amount of bright multicolored light that looks gorgeous, so it's an easy recommend.

"I'm a huge believer in essential oils and am actively striving to eliminate chemical laden products from our daily life as much as possible, so I was delighted to be able to try this organic pest control spray.We moved into a new house several months ago and we've had a horrible time with big banana spiders and scorpions, so I was hoping that this could provide a safe product that would kill them as well as deter them. According to the product description and the ingredients listed on the label this is safe for indoor use and won't harm children or pets, and we have two small dogs so this sounds like the perfect solution.Unfortunately the bottle that I received hasn't been effective for actually killing the spiders I sprayed it on so far. I tested it last night and some this morning by spraying it directly on two rather large spiders I found inside and one on the back porch. I sprayed a LOT on each of them and they seemed more offended than sickly.The two inside scurried away behind furniture, and the one on the back porch moved to a different place on it's web and just kept relocating as I sprayed it. I haven't seen a scorpion to try it on yet, but if it isn't working on our spiders I don't have much confidence in it's ability to kill a scorpion. I am spraying what's left along the bottom edges of doors and around window casings in case it works better for me as a deterrent.Perhaps this kills smaller spiders or other insects better than really large spiders though. I'm not having any problem with anything except for spiders and an occasional scorpion though, so I'm afraid I'm disappointed.Retail product provided at no cost by Eco Defense for my testing, evaluation, and review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VN47IRUBQKW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNHYEFM#wasThisHelpful","R2VN47IRUBQKW6","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:58 MinsConstructed of durable cotton canvas, this very attractive retro style light brown laptop messenger bag is well complimented by brown PU leather trim and brass hardware. Measuring 12"" high by 17.5"" wide, this is a roomy bag that features both a zippered closure as well as a fold-over lid with straps and buckles.The majority of this bag's storage space is found in its fully lined main compartment which provides 16.5 "" x 11"" total usable space.

The rear wall is padded down the entirety of it's length plus there is a reinforcement panel for the pack's bottom.The front of the bag also has two roomy 7"" long by 5.5"" high compartments that feature snap closures as well as latches to the top straps. The sides of the bag each have an approximately 6"" high by 4"" wide pocket that closes with PU leather flap and buckle.

" 3:06 MinsWhenever I find round, chuck, sirloin, or brisket on sale I buy some extra to grind up into hamburger meat which I then vacuum seal and freeze. It doesn't always save me money, but at least I know exactly what it's made of, how fresh it is, and how it was handled.Up until now I've been using the grinding attachment for my electric mixer, but I dread having to do that because the mixer is heavy, which makes it a real chore for me to get it out and set up. On top of that, my stand mixer is only 325 watts, so it's not even able to grind as much meat per minute as this grinder can.This stainless steel meat grinder by Avan-Pacific is light enough to move around without straining myself, yet it's plenty stable and sits solidly on the counter when I use it. It operates on 400 watts, so it's powerful enough to grind 3 pounds of meat per minute which is much faster than my stand mixer could manage.It's very simple to set up, simple to use, and comes with everything I need to grind meats, make homemade sausages, and even includes an attachment for making the meat tubes for Kibbeh!  It's as easy to disassemble to clean the parts when I'm done as it was to put them together, and I just hand wash, rinse, let air dry, and then wipe down the grinding plates with vegetable oil to keep them in good shape till next time.With just four Blu-ray backlit controls, the grinder is extremely user friendly with just an on/off rocker, a grind, off, and reverse switch. The machine is made of high quality stainless steel, food grade aluminum, and ABS plastic, and meets all US safety standards. It's fire proof, has built in circuit overload protection and anti-surge protection as well, and comes with a one year manufacturer warranty.I made a brief video so you could see it being used, so I pre-cut and slightly chilled a 4 pound bottom round roast which I ground using the medium grinding plate.  You'll want to cut your meat into strips or chunks slightly more narrow than the width of the feed tube before you begin grinding. If you're using especially fatty meats it helps to chill them slightly to firm the fats up before you grind them.This meat grinder costs a lot less than my stand mixer did, and my stand mixer didn't come with the meat grinder accessory which had to be purchased separately. In fact, the sausage making accessory is also an additional purchase for my mixer, but it all comes with this Avan-Pacific grinder, making it a very good value.You get a lot of bang for the buck with this meat grinder and it works like a champ, so it's an easy recommend. Enjoy!I purchased this meat grinder at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.

" 5:55 MinsI own several aromatherapy diffusers, but none of them can run as long as this one can!  Unlike any other diffuser I own, this Diffuscent model by Naska holds 500 ml of water and can safely run for as long as 10 hours at a time diffusing aromatic essential oils throughout my home.In fact, in addition to functioning as an aromatherapy diffuser, the Diffuscent is a multifunctional device that can also function as a room humidifier, an air purifier, an ionizer, or as a night light. Taking up only about as much space as a half gallon ice cream container, this diffuser comes fully assembled and ready to use complete with measuring cup, power cord, and easy to understand manual, so I was able to have it operating within minutes of unboxing it.Fill the water chamber using the included 150ml measuring cup up to the amount you desire, then add 3 to 5 drops of your preferred essential oil per 100 ml. Be sure to use pure essential oils only so you don't damage the sensors or elements in the diffuser. Then set the lid on with the outlet over the vent opening and touch the Mist button to turn the diffuser on and set the time.Using the mist button you can select the running time between 60,120,180 minutes, or continuous ""on"" which will run until you manually stop it or the machine runs too low on water. It has a built-in auto shut off for low water so you can safely set it and forget it without worrying. In addition to setting the running time, you can also select the intensity of mist you want to dispense to increase or decrease it, and you can also select the light mode you desire.This diffuser has 8 primary light colors that operate in a total of 16 hues. You can operate the diffuser with no light on, or you can allow them to cycle from one color to the next in a continuous loop, or you can choose a color you prefer for it to remain on and press the light button to set it at that color. Once set at that color, you can then use the light button again to choose between a bright shade of the color or a dimmer version which makes an excellent nightlight.I love diffusing essential oils throughout my house, and this one will work the longest time and put out more cool mist than any other I have, so I'm going to use it on the kitchen counter to diffuse throughout the living room.  I love the volume of mist this diffuser puts out and the colorful lights in the evening. Note:  I suggest having a paper towel handy when you remove the cover after running the diffuser as condensate may have formed there and it might drip.This is a beautiful and well made aromatherapy diffuser that runs quietly and puts out a generous amount of fine cool mist for up to 10 hours, making it an easy recommend. I love it and think that you will too. Enjoy!This diffuser was provided at no cost for evaluation and review. I hope that my inspection and observations about it prove helpful with your decision making.

"I love essential oils, so I was pleased to see that this Moisturizing Olive and Jojoba Body Oil by Luseta contained 100% pure and natural essential and carrier oils rich in vitamins and nutrients beneficial for healthy skin and hair, and nothing else.  The product comes in a 4oz. size clear plastic bottle that's styled like an antique elixir bottle, so it would make a very nice addition to a gift basket ensemble.Safe to use on skin or hair, the oil has a distinct lavender scent that some will like, and others like myself won't care for all that much.  Although the bottle comes equipped with a reducer I still found that it dispenses liberally, so be careful how much you pour. It's best to use a small amount and gently massage it in until absorbed before applying more. In my case at least, I found that it absorbed into my skin very quickly once applied and massaged in for a moment or two, and then it left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I like using it for my face, neck, arms, legs, and cuticles. If you use it in your hair I suggest you just moisten the fingertips and run them through the ends of your hair rather than adding the product to your hair directly. That way you can better regulate how much oil you're applying and avoid oily looking hair. The oils in this product will help nourish your hair follicles, repair dry hair, stop spilt ends, and produce a healthy looking shine.Ingredients in this product include Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ethlhexyl Palmitate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.Possible allergy risks: Soybean Oil, Wheat Germ Oil** Oddly enough I do not see Jojoba Oil listed among the ingredients. I called the manufacturer and they stated that this lot had a mistake in the label that omitted it, but it is included and the labels are being fixed.  This is a nice moisturizing oil blend that's loaded with beneficial ingredients good for healthy skin and hair.Product supplied at no cost by Luseta for evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWOV8IMQMFFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144S0JJU#wasThisHelpful","RUWOV8IMQMFFI","A3SETGFGBQ9YL3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SETGFGBQ9YL3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sleek looking red universal cylinder knife block that safely houses 12 knifes up to 8.9"" long. Measuring approximately 4"" around by 9"" high, this block has a unique dual layer v-slot design in the top that allows knifes to go in and come out with ease and also protects their finish.This is so much more convenient than a standard knife block where each knife has to go in it's specific slot. With this SimPrium cylinder block I can quickly slip a knife into the opening anywhere there's a space and it will fit just fine. I fit a set of six various ceramic knives in just to test it and they inserted easily and were easy to extract for use as well. I also tried putting a stainless steel butcher knife in to see if it would fit and it does!This knife block is unique, versatile, extremely useful and it looks great in the kitchen too. It's has a soft matte finish and feels lightweight, yet it's stable on the counter, doesn't slip or slide, and doesn't tip when I withdraw knives. In fact it moves less than my large wooden knife block does. Keeping it clean is easy since I can just wipe off the top, or if I need a more thorough cleaning I can take the knives out and run water through the top to flush the block out completely.Made from Polypropylene for strength and dimensional stability with a TPR coating, this knife block looks sleek and modern and is made to last fro years to come, so it's an easy recommend. I love it and if you're looking for something to safely house your knives in I recommend it without reservations. It's beautiful!I purchased this red universal cylinder knife block at a reduced cost in exchange for product testing and offering my honest opinion.

"I ordered this stopper in the hope that it would be a close replacement for the one the plumber installed when the house was built. The great news was that it was identical! The stopper works by ""push to close - push again to open"" operation, and my original didn't want to open any more.It's an easy screw-in replacement that requires (at most) a flat head screwdriver (you screw off the chrome cap by hand to expose the brass fitting with the notch for the screw driver).  Don't over-tighten it, just a snug fit is all you need.As others have cautioned - be sure of your size before ordering (or if in doubt get both, they are cheap enough!).  3/8"" is about the diameter of a standard pencil or BIC pen. Take yours out and look at the screw to determine the size or measure with calipers if you are able. Otherwise hold end-to-end with a pencil - same diameter? Then you need 3/8"". Smaller than the pencil? You need 5/16.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGSADNSF3M0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HBVOG#wasThisHelpful","RVGSADNSF3M0L","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm giving four stars for my initial review, because I don't have enough experience with the new Griot's Cleaner Wax to say how durable it is over time.  I will update at the bottom of this review (and may modify the rating if necessary) in time.I've waited a long time for Griot's to offer a cleaner wax.  I've used Meguire's cleaner wax for decades with good results. For several years now, I have been using many Griot's products and am happy to see this added to the collection. A cleaner wax will remove some oxidation, some grime, and old wax layers - which reduces the number of steps you need to do and saves you work.  This wax seems to do a good job of that. I first used it without using a clay bar first - to test its cleaning capability. The results were very good, and it seemed to strip the micro-contaminants and wax remnants away nicely, leaving an even and very smooth coat.  Application is easy - it goes on smooth, and dries to a haze in just a few minutes. Removal is also easy if you don't over-apply.At its core is hard carnauba  wax - offering long lasting, shiny, and strong protection. Can be applied manually or with an orbital. I used the Griot's foam wax pad, and buffed with a clean microfiber towel, and my results have been very good. I'll keep this in stock in the garage for sure!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JXCF1E5ZSU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJ3C65E#wasThisHelpful","R31JXCF1E5ZSU8","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Use a lot of caution if you are considering this holster as an actual ""carry"" solution. For that purpose, I cannot recommend it under any circumstances! I knew it would be iffy for fitment of some pistols, and I really just wanted it as a ""fits many"" type of solution for range work or training. But alas, I've yet to find a pistol that fits in this holster properly. Here are just a few I have tried: Glock 17, Glock 23, S&W M&P 9, S&W M&P 45, Sig Sauer P226/P227, Walther PPQ, Walther PPX; Springfield XD...  I've probably tried more, but those are the ones that come to mind.Problem is the plastic ""sleeve"" inside the holster. It does a nice job of keeping the holster held open, but it creates what is essentially a plastic tube that has no elasticity at all and will not conform to the pistol. And because it's not made for any specific gun - no gun really fits it.  The other big problem is the stitching that creates the trigger guard portion of the holster.  It is shallow and poorly designed, and is really only the sandwiching of the two layers of material sewn together.  Only fairly small pistols in the range of those that should fit it (4"" to 5"" barrel pistols) can even be pushed in far enough that the trigger is not exposed.Trying to force pistols into the holster usually results in forcing the slide back - which would take it out of battery and is completely unacceptable of course.  And don't even get me started on the retention strap (first off, you don't need a retention strap on a IWB holster any more than you need a clutch pedal in a car with an auto tranny). The strap in inflexible and does not position well for practical use. Thankfully it can be removed! Some dedicated work and break-in might make in so-so for me for some limited range use.I have not yet found a pistol that fits it well, and I've tried a bunch. For a range holster I might still be able to use it with a gun or two. But please reconsider if you are looking at this for a concealed carry holster! That is not a place to skimp - look elsewhere!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHVU9IL7IMKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HOAZWDE#wasThisHelpful","RQHVU9IL7IMKR","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My GSD loves these treats!  And I don't mind giving him one every day, because the ingredients are good and the texture helps keep his teeth clean.  I've used Natural Balance dog food products for years and have come to trust the brand for nutrition and quality. These treats are a nice addition to the lineup!  The texture is very firm, but not too hard.  Another thing I like about them is that they don't produce crumbs.

"These blue rubber gloves are very good for all general purpose uses.  The only minor drawback (and reason for 4 rather than 5 stars) is that they fit me a little loose - unlike traditional rubber/surgical gloves that expand to fit your hand.  What you lose is just a little bit of fine fingertip capability - but I found that you can draw them tighter into the webs of the fingers and it really helps.The gloves are powdered just enough for easy on/off but not overly so.  I've used them for automotive work, workbench work, cleaning jobs, etc. and they are very durable. I've yet to have one tear or break.A good glove and a good value.

"After having to replace a dead original remote with one of the horrible Genie new style 3-button remotes, I was so frustrated with its poor function that I was considering having the entire unit replaced to get a new system.  What's worse - it was my wife that had to use it. Yep - so don't think I didn't get evil looks and nasty complaints every day.I knew this old style one-button remote was no longer made, so I was thrilled to find this one available. It cost about 3X what it should have - and the packaging was dusty and yellowed with age - and the original battery in it was dead. But it was still worth it - know why? BECAUSE IT WORKS!!! Took only a couple minutes to put in a new battery (which I had planned for) and get it programmed, and then in turn use it to program the Homelink system in the vehicle.So, if you've tried the new style remotes with similar frustration and you see one of these for sale - even at high prices - BUY IT.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR771KC76BE6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000628QSA#wasThisHelpful","RR771KC76BE6D","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You simply can't go wrong with this bundle of Apple iPhone 5/5s silicone protectors. I specifically needed this style protector/skin for the phone so that I can easily slip the phone in and out of it (I have a dock in the car that doesn't allow for any case).  These fit the bill perfectly, and offer excellent protection.  It is also a bonus that my wife an I can use different colors to avoid grabbing the wrong phone.The cases fit the phone perfectly and provide a soft cushion.

"First thing you need to know is that these shorts (just like the long pants of the same brand) run SMALL. Order at least one full even or odd size up, and you should be okay. If you wear 32, get a 34, and so on.The Propper shorts are identical to the long pants, and I like them both very much. In most ways, they are nearly the same as 5.11 tactical pants/shorts - they even have the same type pockets (including the excellent cell phone pocket on the left).  But the back pockets of the Proppers are preferable to me - rather than just a huge pouch (ala 5.11) they have a pocket-inside-a-pocket.  This gives you a well fitting rear pocket for your wallet, with a larger outer pocket around it.  Very nice.The Propper brand is good, and makes well manufactured and durable clothes. Much less expensive than 5.11's and worth a look. Just remember to order a size larger!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BP0TGC5JA01H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047FGGPC#wasThisHelpful","R2BP0TGC5JA01H","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far - so good.  I have only used the folding wagon a couple of times so far, but it is doing exactly what I bought it for.  I think a lot of the problems some folks have with it might be due to overloading or imbalance of loads.  This is a folding device, so by definition it will not be rigid and as sturdy as a solid fixed-size device.It fits a LOT of gear - especially if you get creative about packing and stacking! I use mine to tote a lot of range bags, camera bags, folding chairs, tripods, coolers - you name it. It does a very nice job.  I have pulled it over some very uneven and rough terrain and it did well.  Sure, it would be nice to have large pneumatic wheels, but then you lose the compact size.The wagon folds and unfolds VERY EASILY - there is one center pull at the bottom of the wagon that will fold it right up - similar to modern strollers and other devices. The provided cover and adjustable straps ensure that it remains folded and makes it easy to handle.  There is also a durable handle that once folded, makes it easy to carry.This is a great solution for those of us who need something to drag all our gear around, but can't or don't want to sacrifice the space needed for a full sized fixed wagon or cart.I plan to use this wagon frequently and I don't plan to baby it. If I have any problems with wear, breaking, sturdiness in the future - you can bet I'll update this review.

"My house is about 12 years old now, and after the second smoke alarm started acting up, I decided it was time to replace all of them proactively.  I have replaced all the detectors/alarms in my house with this model and have not had any problems.  The ring that mounts to the ceiling is a different size than the previous model by BRK that I replaced, so I had to swap the whole thing out - but I wound up being glad because the old ones had yellowed a bit and the new ones look nicer.The problems some folks have are almost all attributed to the batteries. I have been lucky and haven't had those issues, but you basically have three choices: 1) Get a tester and test each battery, replacing those that need it; 2) Replace all the batteries before installing, just to be sure; 3) Install the alarms, cross your fingers, and replace any batteries that chirp.  I used option 3 and as I said, have been lucky.These units are economical and are an easy swap to most builder installed units - using the same wiring harness and connector.  Just about as easy an install as you can get.  Battery problems have more to do with how long they sit in various warehouses - something beyond the control of the manufacturer and the buyer... so just try to be prepared that some may be old and need immediate replacement and you should be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16346J9BV3MK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUH86B4#wasThisHelpful","R16346J9BV3MK6","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After looking at, and thinking about these 5.11 shirts for a long time, I finally decided to spring for one and try it. I'm glad I did!  The 5.11 Covert shirt is extremely comfortable and breathes very well. It also serves its intended purpose of assisting in concealment perfectly - especially if you get the plaid or print.There are inside pockets on each breast, made of mesh and held shut with Velcro.  Not suitable for concealing a weapon, but good for tucking away other small flat items. I haven't used them yet, but they seem to be practical enough.  The sides are relieved with high slits that are held with Velcro also. These can provide easy access to a hidden sidearm.  Last but not least, are the snaps - yes, snaps not buttons. There are no buttons on this shirt, except at the very top (the one you would likely leave open) - but the snap tops look exactly like buttons, right down to the false threads in the button holes.  The shirt can be pulled open easily and one handed to access your concealed firearm quickly.These shirts are not cheap - which is why I waited so long to try one. But they are of the highest quality and very practical.  The sizes seem to run true - my medium is a good medium by my standards.  I highly recommend these shirts and will be buying more. I hope they will expand the options of colors and patterns over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NP4RD2T8OXUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00878L9C0#wasThisHelpful","R1NP4RD2T8OXUG","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good product. I've used Fobus holsters and mag pouches for a long time and I like them. This 1911 magazine carrier is well made, fits the magazines well, and is easy to use. The paddle design is one I prefer, especially for shooting competition use - easy on and off, and you can place it where you want it, instead of where your belt loops will allow.  I recommend the product!The seller I got it from however, was Ehud Warehouse, and left me wondering if what I got was actually new or used.  To their credit they shipped it promptly and it was received fast (from Israel).  But when I opened it, the mag pouch was heavily marred and scratched - even on the back of the paddle (the soft red rubber area was badly scratched up).  This makes me think that perhaps it is a used product.  I'm not saying I would mind that - but don't sell it as new.  Lastly, no one in their right mind is paying $75 for this product, no matter how good it is. So when you see the ""wow, what a great deal"" price - take that with a grain of salt.

"""If you read just one book about gun safety...""  As the often used phrase goes, I can't think of a book that it might apply better to. Over the past few years alone, gun sales (and presumably new gun owners) have increased exponentially.  With firearm ownership comes serious responsibility - even if you live alone.  This book does a great job of introducing the new gun owner to the concepts, rules, and reasons of gun safety - in a way that is neither condescending or sugar-coated.The author (one of the most credentialed and qualified to do so) lays out the basics of gun safety and then explains each rule. Rather than just beating the ""memorize this list"" horse, Massad Ayoob realizes that knowledge and learning come from understanding - and he lets the reader understand where the dangers lie and how to prevent them.All the important topics are covered: Gun safety rules; Safe handling practices; Safe and secure storage; Guns and children; etc.  And yet, at just under 120 pages, the book is not some ordeal to overcome - something you will make a good effort to read and then put down for lack of time.  It can be easily read in a weekend - or a single rainy day, with no problem.  This is important, because all of the wisdom in the universe put into an unread book is meaningless. The author understands this, and has made this the perfect 'digest'.Near the end of the book, almost as a segue into a different topic, are several case studies of accidental and negligent discharges that have occurred, each with a detailed forensic evaluation of what was done wrong, what went wrong, and lessons of prevention.I've been around guns all my life, and I find it important for seasoned ""gun folk"" to pick up a book such as this from time to time too. Complacency is the arch-enemy of safety in any practice!

While the Wi-Fi works great with iPhone and makes controlling the camera a snap, it sucks the battery dry in no time!  This back gives you the ability to pre-frame your shots (particularly when using a mount or tripod) and change your camera settings - with less drain on the battery.  You will still use more battery than without, due to the view screen that is added, but not as bad as broadcasting the signal for the phone connection.The screen is decent size (as big as is possible) and the touch functions work well. Resolution is very good and it is easy to read and navigate the menus.The Touch BacPac greatly enhances the options available to you to use and enjoy your HERO3 camera - highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPVZFN2Q1WC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9RO4CU#wasThisHelpful","RQPVZFN2Q1WC8","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little tool is handy to keep in the range bag. It will not help you load the moon clips, but makes easy work of unloaded the empty cases.

"Quirky, but versatile, this ladder system is the one to have if you only want one ladder for your home.  Because it can easily serve as stepladder and extension ladder, it takes the place of two right off the bat. Add to that the versatility of the system that allows one side to be telescoped longer than the other (such as for use on stairs or sloped areas), and you have a great ladder.So, why hold back a star? Well, all that versatility comes at a cost and some compromise. ""Do everything well"" usually means it doesn't do anything best - and so it is with the Little Giant ladder system.  First off, it is heavy. Really, really heavy. There is a lot of length crammed into a compact package, at the price you pay is an easy to store, easy to transport 'heavy' ladder.  Secondly, unlike traditional step ladders, there is no flat surface at the top, no place to lay your hammer or paint brush - you have to buy add-ons for that. Not a big deal, just one small downside of this design.But - it was great to use this ladder right away to reach a window I've been unable to clean (inside two-story foyer) because the extension ladder I had was too short.  It is great to be able to easily store this ladder and move it around the house without fear of knocking over furniture or banging walls. All that is worth the cost of the added weight.Take a little time to read the good instructions that come with the ladder, and practice with it before first use. I took mine into the yard to practice using it, where I would have ample room if needed. Be careful about ways to pinch or slam your fingers - that is another hazard of the design.Good ladder system - replaces several ladders - versatile design allows creative uses.

"Works perfectly in a standard 2"" receiver. The black coating on the handle of the pin and the cotter pin help make this hitch pin disappear when installed.  It is well made and goes on in a snap.

"This background will get the job done, but it's not the best out there.  In the price range though, it's as good as any I've seen.  The cotton weave wrinkles easily which is a downside, but the color is very even and solid.  The pockets for inserting a hanging bar are very good and are generous in size.  That will work with just about any sized rod, and also makes it easier to move the fabric along the rod.Mine came with a small tear hole in the pocket area, that does not affect its use, but still takes away from overall quality.

"I had a Bissell Little Green cleaner for many years, and it was a great tool to have when a spill or the dog gave me a spot on the carpet that needed cleaning.  After several years though, it finally stopped pumping water - almost certainly due to buildup of calcium or similar from our water. So I decided to replace it with a new one, and came across this ""heated"" version.  The price was not too much more than the non-heated so I thought I'd go for it.What a piece of junk.The water barely trickles out of the nozzle.  The old one sprayed water (similar to a steam iron) just near the cleaning nozzle and worked great. This one barely trickles - straight down - and is useless.And the water is ice cold. The heater is a joke. After 10 minutes of use, if you have very sensitive hands and feel around enough places, you can barely feel some warmth below the water tank... but it NEVER comes out even slightly warm - let alone hot.This will almost certainly be the last Bissell product I ever buy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4FQWYGYSOOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KCMH6Q#wasThisHelpful","RD4FQWYGYSOOZ","A1RPJHUVVSI98A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RPJHUVVSI98A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this pistol bayonet - as I'm sure most do - as a sort of gag gift to myself. After all, there are not very many circumstances in which I can imagine a mounted blade on the front of a handgun being either useful or safe.  But that said - this is a product that takes itself seriously, and so it deserves that respect.  With a blade made by Ka Bar, a renowned knife blade maker, and a easy on / easy off mount, it truly is a mountable blade option.I found the fit to be very snug for Glock, Smith and Wesson, and Walther rails - and so snug that I gave up trying to mount in on a Sig Sauer (P226).  Perhaps wear and use might ease that some, or one could try to sand it down.It's a good quality blade - nice and sharp, with a useful saw edge too.

"Swiss Army of phone cases. My husband absolutely loves this case! He is the hiking, backpacing, pocket knife carrying guy. I love carrying a pocket knife too, but this totally cracked me up so I had to get it for him! He loves it and shows it off to his friends and classmates (he is a mechanical engineering student) any chance he gets. Its more of a conversation piece than anything but it does protect his phone as well and he loves playing with all the things in it and he uses them from time to time as well.

"I have been pleased with Jarrow brand supplements. I have wanted to try mastic gum for some mild but chronic reflux pain.Jarrow formulas always seem clean and fresh. This is no exception. It smells pleasant. If you are used to taking supplements, this will be no problem. The pills aren't excessively huge or sticky. I was surprised at how well and how quickly it worked. It seems effective symptomatically. Some supplements require extended use before any effect is noticed. But this helped right away.My 12 year old has significant stomach pain. Her doc said it would be ok to try this before we move on to more invasive things. This has actually helped her.

"This is kind of weird book. Henry is advertised as a sociopath. He is constant feeling things though. He is sad. He is annoyed. Much later he is grieving and in his own way afraid. But all his feelings are about him. He misses being loved. He wants. He needs. I would say he is a malignant narcissist. He is the reason there is such a word.Because of Henry's limitations  we don't get a very clear picture of the women he interacts with. The parts of the story that are outside of Henry's experience don't do much to round them out. Martha is brilliant self sacrificing and slavishly devoted. Betty is also devoted. But I never quite understood why. We are asked to believe that he has some cunning charm. But we don't see it.The woman are just types. The long suffering wife. The young mistress. They don't get any more than that.I wanted some sort of explanation for Martha. Why would she partner with this awful man? There are a few vague lines: ""We must love Henry without understanding him"". But they are still about Henry. The writer was just as wrapped up in Henry as Henry is. No one else really gets to matter to either of them.I was kind of surprised at some of the characterizations. A lazy dog is describe as a sleeping Mexican crossing guard. We get the detail about Betty's perfume over and over.I would have found Henry more interesting had the writer found him just a little less so. The mystery in this story is not Henry. It was Martha. That was where the interesting story was.SPOILERS-The police are unbelievably thick-literally. It is hard to believe. The one rogue cop that pursues Henry ends up being of no interest. Random plot lines pop up and then wander off. It is hard to suspend disbelief. And it is hard to connect to the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WK5C48K2F2KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147679555X#wasThisHelpful","R2WK5C48K2F2KQ","A2P739KOM4U5JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P739KOM4U5JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Rules is a frustrating book. On one hand the set up is great. The writing is pretty good. You have no trouble getting a little anxious as the evenings events unfold. Holder does a great job of making you feel Robin's trapped terrified mindset.On the other hand, The Rules is loaded with so many cliches that I lost count. Evil albino? Check. Kids deciding to split up while being picked off one by one? Yep. Barking dog with a victim? Present. Even who the killer was is a huge cliche. It would be funny if it was a satire or a twist on the cliches but it isn't. She is telling the story in all seriousness, cliches and all.The Rules also just goes on too long. About the middle, there is a good level of confusion going. But the story keeps going and going. If you managed to pay attention it becomes way to obvious what the big twist is. Holder has eliminated any other possibility.Spoiler-I am a little befuddled that this turned out to be such a blatant knock off of Agatha Chrisitie's  And then There were None. After all the other characters were eliminated by the story I started really hoping that things weren't going the way I suspected they were. But the twist was plucked straight from one of last centuries most popular mysteries. The whole mystery set up was just borrowed wholesale. Yes, they are teenagers. That is pretty much the only difference. Holder also divided the villain into 2 characters. But it is still the same story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GLKU1GC25TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385741006#wasThisHelpful","R12GLKU1GC25TW","A2P739KOM4U5JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P739KOM4U5JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used lotions and oil on wet skin since I was a kid. So I know that is an idea that works.Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer is a light lotion that you apply after leaving the shower. The cream is thin enough to spread easily. Since you are adding it to wet skin, you don't need too much. Besides, excess will just get wiped off on the towel.Right after use, I was impressed with the moisture. On the bottle it says it will leave you with luminous skin. It actually does, for a few minutes. The moisturization doesn't last very long. It was also not really up to rough dry skin like feet or elbows.This is listed as a green tea oil lotion. I think that is what they were going for with the scent. I usually like green tea or just generally ""green"" scents. But this one has a back note that smelled unclean to me. Almost moldy.

"This is a nice set for the casual hobbyist (me). The mask fit perfectly right out of the box. The seal is tight but still comfortable. I have really high cheekbones and sometimes that is a problem. The mask still fit perfectly. I was not as smart as some of the other reviewers and didn't think to use anti-fog in the new mask. It has a great seal so it fogged up a lot. I order some spray to fix that.My favorite part of this set is the snorkel. The closest place for us to swim is a lake. There are lovely things to see  so I want to able to look in the water  rather than making sure there is nothing getting in the snorkel. The only times I had anything get in the snorkel was when kids were splashing me heavily on purpose.I am a size 9 but usually wear a 9.5 because I need more width.

"Ancient Appetites is a steampunk and alternative history geared towards the YA market. There is certainly a need for this book. Steampunk is wildly popular but most of the steampunk books I have read are really no appropriate for the YA market.Author, Oisin McGann, has created a fascinating world. Every now and then he lapses into telling about the world rather than letting us see it. But this is kept to a minimum. His steampunk Ireland is as lush and fun as one would expect without being cliche or obvious. I was less enthralled with his characters. Nate is really the only one who gets to be a whole person at all. Nate still feels a little unoriginal on occasion with his rebellion against the family business. His brothers are shadows at best.The unique moral code of this family makes it a little hard to get too attached to any of the characters. Essentially, they just aren't very nice people. Nate of course, is the exception. But Marcus' death just seems like just desserts.That odd moral code is a great topic of discussion. I always read YA and children's novels with an eye towards the kinds of learning and discussion they might facilitate. This is a great opportunity to discuss morals and their origin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2LG1M1J29H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497665701#wasThisHelpful","RN2LG1M1J29H","A2P739KOM4U5JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P739KOM4U5JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is cliche, cheesy, over wrought and outright offensive.Why do romance novels insist on portraying the most horrible behavior as passion? Ugh.The Megan storyline is the more tolerable of the two. It isn't great. Merlin is powerful. He has no power to help the woman he loves. This world is written without a very clear set of rules. He is useless when the story needs someone useless. There seems to be no other guiding set of ideas.The Laura storyline is horrendous. She is breathtakingly selfish. She writes off her husbands wants and needs casually.

"It was so hard to get into this book. I read it and found myself skimming again and again. It felt tedious. I wanted to connect with the story. But wandering through Rebecca's mind is not fun. She is not interesting. She comes off as not very bright. She doesn't have much of a grasp on what is going on in the present. She has no idea what went on in her past. She goes over the story but manages to do it with no self awareness whatsoever. It was very frustrating.The parts where Callie is talking were much more tolerable. The horrible truth about bullying is that sometimes the people we love are bullied but sometimes they are bullies. Rebecca's struggle to deal with some pretty basic issues makes her a less than useful resource for Callie.Over all, I felt like Frankel had some worthwhile things to say.

I dust regularly. i am not getting ahead.I dusted the den and then I set this up and ran it for 24 hours. At the end, the air in the den had no dust or tiny things drifting. I also noticed that no dust had settled in that time. The filter was already full of junk.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: This cleanser has an interesting, and complex, blend of cleansers with moisturizers and skin conditioning agents. This skin care product is free of animal testing, parabens, retinol, fragrances, sulfates, and GMO ingredients. This cleanser is vegan, which means that its ingredients are not derived from animal sources. Negatives: Perhaps due to its complex blend of oils and fatty acids, this cleanser does not rinse off as easily as most skin cleansers. This product contains phenoxyethanol, which can have worse side effects than the use of parabens. On a per-fluid-ounce basis, this is far more expensive than most facial/skin cleansers.This non-foaming gel cleanser has a buttery smooth creamy consistency that feels very nice on the skin.  Even though foaming does not improve a cleanser's cleaning effectiveness, some people prefer more of a foaming lathering action in their cleansers.  This product spreads out more like a lotion than a soap or shampoo.  While everyone's skin chemistry can differ, I felt no irritation, rash, or redness after using this cleanser on my face for the past few weeks.  Except for maybe some really simple old-fashioned soaps made out of lard, lye, and water, all modern cosmetics and skin/hair care products can cause side effects in different people.  So the proverbial ""your mileage may vary"" disclaimer applies here.It is natural to compare this Own cleanser to Cetaphil since Cetaphil has been on the market far longer.  This Own cleanser consists of 24 ingredients, which is three times more than Cetaphil's 8 ingredients.  Cetaphil's eight ingredients are: water, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben.  Three of Cetaphil's ingredients are parabens.  Parabens can cause dermatitis and rosacea in people who are sensitive or allergic to these compounds.  If skin that is coated with methylparaben is exposed to ultraviolet light (e.g. UVB from sunlight), the methylparaben can react with UV rays to increase the rate of cellular death, DNA damage, skin aging, and overall skin damage.  Methylparaben is used as a preservative in many cosmetics.  The sodium lauryl sulfate in Cetaphil has a cleansing action in removing the oils from your skin.  Sodium lauryl sulfate is excellent at dissolving oils, so it is also frequently used in laundry detergents along with uses in various industrial cleansers, and it is used as a degreaser on car engines.  However, its degreasing effectiveness can also make it too harsh for sensitive skin.Here is a brief description of each of the 24 ingredients in this Own facial cleanser: Water: The main fluid in which all 23 other ingredients are mixed with. Cetearyl Alcohol: A blend of Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol, this emulsifies and adds creaminess to the blend, and since it improves moisture retention, it is often used in hair conditioners.  Cetaphil labels this as two separate ingredients of Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol. Glycerin: Frequently added to moisturizer products, and like the propylene glycol used in Cetaphil, it acts as a humectant to help absorb and retain moisture. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride: Like Cetearyl Alcohol, this is also derived from coconut oil.  It is considered an excellent emollient and skin-repairing ingredient in cosmetics due to its mix of fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss. Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil: Safflower oil is commonly used in foods and cooking, and it has excellent nutritional value due to its high content of linoleic acid.  When used on skin, it acts as a lubricant. Cetearyl Olivate / Sorbitan Olivate: Both Cetearyl Olivate and Sorbitan Olivate are derived from olive oil, and they help to moisturize the skin. Glyceryl Stearate: An emulsifier derived from vegetable oils, it helps to soften and moisturize skin. Lauryl Glucoside / Cetearyl Glucoside / Decyl Glucoside: All three of these glucosides are mild surfactants derived from plants that function as cleansers in this blend.  A ""surfactant"" is a compound that is often used in soaps and detergents because it can help dissolve and separate oil, dirt, and proteins. Stearic Acid: A powerful surfactant with a strong cleansing action, it also acts as an emulsifier to keep everything blended in this mix of ingredients.  Stearic acid sources can come from either natural oils like palm, coconut, and butters, or it can come from animal fat, such as the fat from cows, sheep, pigs, and euthanized dogs and cats.  Since this Own product says that it is both vegan and not tested on animals, I assume that the stearic acid used in this product is derived from plant sources and not from animals. Glycolic Acid: Acting as a mild exfoliant, glycolic acid works by breaking down substances that bond dead skin cells beneath the top layer of skin.  Dead skin cells, which contribute to clogged pores and dull skin, can then be rinsed away. Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil: Jojoba oil is extracted from seeds of a desert shrub that is native to California.  It is a waxy oil that is easily absorbed into the skin to help soften skin. Tocopherol: A form of vitamin E, this is sometimes included in skin moisturizers and sunscreens.  However, it is debatable as to how useful tocopherol is when applied to the skin since it can be destroyed by exposure to the UV rays of sunlight.  When used as a facial cleanser, some tocopherol may be absorbed into your sebaceous glands before they are later released into your skin as part of your skin oil secretions. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate: This interesting compound can be absorbed into your skin where it is converted into vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid).  When used in skin care products, MAP is actually more effective than straight vitamin C in functions of UV protection and repair, collagen production, skin lightening and brightening, and as an anti-inflammatory. Hydroxyethylcellulose: Derived from cellulose, this is added to give the cleanser a thicker gel consistency. Allantoin: Allantoin can be derived from either botanical extracts of the comfrey plant or the urine of most mammals.  Since this cleanser is ""vegan"", I presume that the allantoin used here comes from the comfrey plant :-)  It has good moisturizing and skin-conditioning abilities. Sodium PCA: An amino acid derivative, sodium PCA is very hygroscopic, attracting moisture from the air. It imparts a moist feeling to skin. Sodium Hydroxide: Also known as lye, it is used in its concentrated form to make soap and dissolve through clogged drains.  But since sodium hydroxide is extremely alkaline, I suspect that it is added to this cleanser to adjust the pH. Panthenol: A derivative of vitamin B5, it has humectant, emollient, and moisturizer properties.  It is often used in hair shampoos and conditioners because it quickly coats the entire hair shaft and seals the hair.  In this facial cleanser, it functions to improve the skin's hydration. Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter): A fat that is extracted from the African shea tree, it has multiple uses in skin care products, acting as an emollient and moisturizer to protect and repair skin, and to improve the elasticity and suppleness of skin. Ethylhexylglycerin: Derived from glycerin, this is often used as an alternative to parabens.  Its surfactant properties allow it function as both a skin cleanser and conditioner.  It can be a skin irritant for some people. Phenoxyethanol: Although this is sometimes used as a preservative in skin care products as a supposedly safer alternative to parabens, this phenoxyethanol is, by far, the most suspect and controversial ingredient used in this facial cleanser.  Phenoxyethanol has been proven to be a skin irritant that can cause contact dermatitis and worsen eczema in humans.  Previous research has also shown that phenoxyethanol can cause various problems in the nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems of animals.  In 2008, the FDA issued a product recall alert about a ""Mommy's Bliss Nipple Cream"" that contained phenoxyethanol and the FDA warned that the phenoxyethanol ""can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration in infants.""Many skin care products contain fragrances that can be either too strong or prone to causing allergic reactions.  Like Cetaphil, this cleanser is fragrance-free.  This cleanser lotion is gluten-free.  Even though gluten cannot be absorbed through the skin, the use of gluten or wheat products in cosmetics or skin care products can present a problem for people who have who have celiac disease or gluten intolerance if the product is swallowed.  And since this is a facial cleanser, there is tiny possibility that you could be too vigorous in massaging the cleanser on your face so that some enters inside your mouth.This cleanser is advertised to ""gently exfoliate"", but the exfoliating effects of its glycolic acid ingredient are really subtle.  If you want to gently strip off more dead skin cells from the surface of your skin, there are various brands of microdermabrasion kits that combine a battery-operated brush scrubber with a gritty cream to perform gentle exfoliation on your face where the result may be more noticeable.  Stronger over-the-counter glycolic acid exfoliation treatments may contain a higher 10% concentration of glycolic acid.  Clinics offer chemical peels using 30%, 50%, or 70% concentrations of glycolic acid, along with other stronger chemical peels.  This Own cleanser likely uses a very mild glycolic acid concentration.  If you want to maximize the exfoliation results using this Own cleanser, you should leave it on your skin for one or two minutes before washing it all off. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Overall, this is a good facial cleanser.  I would have really preferred that this cleanser did not contain phenoxyethanol, which can cause various adverse skin reactions in humans and can potentially have more toxic side effects.  I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because it does not seem to totally rinse off as cleanly as Cetaphil and many other skin cleansers.  To me, a skin cleanser should be like a hair shampoo in that they should both rinse off without leaving a residue, whereas a skin moisturizer is like a hair conditioner in that they both leave a residue or coating to serve their purpose.  Because this cleanser does not rinse off as easily, it is probably easier to rinse off in the shower instead of standing over the sink.  I tried taking a clean washcloth into the shower and using the wet washcloth to wipe my face more, and that helped to expedite the rinsing and cleaning.  But perhaps this Own cleanser uses such a complex mixture of cleansers combined with moisturizers and oils, it is like washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner at the same time: your hair does not wash and rinse as cleanly when shampoo and conditioner are combined together.  This Own cleanser is also currently four times more expensive than Cetaphil, currently priced at $2.40 per fluid ounce compared to 60 to 65 cents per fluid ounce for Cetaphil.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPRJBTE9YUST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KJ353U#wasThisHelpful","R2LPRJBTE9YUST","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In particular, one ""Broccoli Cilantro"" tea bag contains 90% DV of calcium because of the broccoli being used.  Each tea bag is larger in size and heavier than most tea bags.  Most tea bags weigh 2 to 3 grams while these tea bags weigh 3.6 to 4.8 grams, depending upon the flavor.How much you like these tea blends may depend upon what you expect a ""tea"" to taste like, if you prefer traditional tea blends or are open to newfangled tea ideas, whether you think that some ingredients such as onion and garlic do not belong in a tea bag, and also how much you like the herbs and spices.  For example, some people have an allergy to cilantro that makes anything containing cilantro taste like soap to them.  For those people, the ""Broccoli Cilantro"" and ""Tomato Mint"" blends may taste bad.  Other people do not like the smell or essence of fennel or anise, and may thus not like the ""Fennel Spice"" blend.  I like all six of these flavors, and my preferences may vary depending on the day of the week or the mood I am in :)The tea's instructions say to add 10 ounces of boiling water, steep for 10 minutes or longer, and then squeeze the bag after steeping to maximize flavor.  None of these six tea flavors can really be over-steeped, so you can just leave the bags in your cup and also add more boiling water to re-steep them.  Since I also drink a lot of loose leaf tea ""Chinese style"" by not using a mesh tea ball or strainer and I just let the loose leaf tea float around in my cup, my favorite way to drink these Numi savory teas is to cut open the tea bag, pour all the tea bag contents into my tea mug (which is a large two-cup mug) and then pour boiling water into the loose tea blend.  I like strongly flavored teas, coffees, and beers, and treating these tea blends as if they were loose leaf teas maximizes the flavor much more than just keeping the contents confined inside the tea bag.  After all, it is okay to swallow tea leaves, and the rest of the tea bags' ingredients consist of vegetables, herbs, and spices that are normally cooked and eaten anyway.Numi is a company based in Oakland, CA.  While they also carry many conventional teas in both loose leaf and tea bag packaging, this is one of the more unusual teas that you can drink.  But if you keep an open mind and think of it as being somewhat of a tea and somewhat of a vegetable herb soup, these are quite enjoyable to drink.  But if you are a tea traditionalist, you may be disappointed at how dilute the actual flavor of the tea leaves is in each of these tea bags.  The herbs and spices are far more noticeable in these tea blends while the green/black tea and vegetables have more of a subtle flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RILBYFWPT8L1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9AAI9S#wasThisHelpful","RILBYFWPT8L1G","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies! Positives: This printer can output superb gallery-quality prints with exceptional detail and resolution, while being significantly less expensive than the higher-end Pro-10 and Pro-1 printer models. This Pro-100 prints better blacks and grays on monochrome prints than the older Pro9000 printer that it replaces. The new wireless connectivity options of using 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi or Apple's AirPrint, along with a wired Ethernet option, provide flexibility of shared usage and printer placement by not needing to be physically connected to a USB cable. The dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years. Negatives: While black-and-white prints are better than the previous Pro9000 printer, monochrome output is still inferior to the pricier Pro-10 and Pro-1 printers.If you have never used a prosumer-level dedicated photo printer like this before, prepare to be surprised... both by the size and weight of this printer's box and by the stunning quality of color photos that you can print out, with exceptional detail and resolution even if you press your nose close to a 13""x19"" print.  Weighing a very hefty 56 pounds in its shipping box, the box that this printer is shipped in resembles a two-drawer file cabinet laying on its side (and it is heavier than most empty two-drawer file cabinets).  This printer was shipped to me in its original Canon box package; the big box was not placed inside another bigger Amazon box.Having previously used Canon's excellent PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II printer, this Pro-100 printer has a number of differences and improvements over that older model.  First of all, this Pro-100 is bigger in size and about 10 to 12 pounds heavier than the Pro9000.  Along with the USB 2.0 cable connection and Wireless PictBridge connection to Canon cameras that are also used in the older Pro9000 printer, this Pro-100 also adds wireless AirPrint printing from iPad/iPhone/iOS devices and, most significantly, both wireless 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet printing from your LAN.  While the ability to print directly and wirelessly from an iPad or Canon camera is useful, I think that for a professional-grade photo printer like this, most people will want to view, edit, adjust, and tweak their photos on their computer first before printing them, so being able to add this printer to my router's wireless LAN is a huge convenience, making it easy to both share the printer between different laptop and desktop computers on the LAN, and to have extra freedom in placing this large printer in an optimum location.While both the Pro9000 and this Pro-100 use eight ink cartridges, the Pro9000's black/cyan/photo-cyan/magenta/photo-magenta/yellow/red/green colors are now represented as black/gray/light-gray/cyan/photo-cyan/magenta/photo-magenta/yellow in this Pro-100, with three inks dedicated to blacks and grays instead of just the one black ink cartridge on the Pro9000, resulting in noticeably better black-and-white monochrome prints on this Pro-100 when compared to the Pro9000.The 10-cartridge Pro-10 printer also has three black/gray colors along with adding a red color back into the mix, while the 12-cartridge top-of-the-line Pro-1 dedicates five ink cartridges to black/gray colors.  If you mainly print a lot of black-and-white photos, you should seriously consider spending the extra money on the Pro-1.  While the Pro-1 has better overall color resolution than this Pro-100, one of the Pro-1's greatest strengths is in the range of blacks and grays that it can accurately print.  High-resolution monochrome prints are one of the toughest test of any photo printer since some inkjet printers leak a slight bit of color cast onto black-and-white prints while other inkjets do not offer enough grayscale resolution, and this Pro-100 is not consistently perfect with its black-and-white output and its printing of the deepest black regions.  While this Pro-100 prints better grays and blacks than what the Pro9000 prints, both Canon's Pro-1 and Epson's R3000 can print noticeably superior black-and-white prints when compared to this Pro-100 monochrome prints.  These are not glaring deficiencies in the print quality, but there are subtle differences in how the black-as-outer-space regions of some photos are printed.Although I have not precisely measured how long each ink cartridge lasts when printing the same photo each time, I have always believed that Epson's printers drink up their ink faster than either Canon or HP inkjet printers, both on Epson's photo printers and their printer/copier/fax multi-function printers.  On average, I get about 7 to 10 large 13""x19"" color prints from this Pro-100 before I have to replace some of the color ink cartridges.  This is comparable to the previous Pro9000 printer.  The more expensive Pro-1 uses ink cartridges that are almost three times larger in ink volume, and its colors are distributed across 12 ink cartridges versus the 8 cartridges used by this Pro-100.  So this Pro-100 needs more frequent ink replacements than the Pro-1 printer, although it uses up the ink at a rate that is comparable to the older Pro9000 printer.  But I seem to replace ink cartridges more frequently on Epson inkjet printers than on Canon printers.  As with ""razor blade marketing"", I think that all inkjet printer manufacturers earn the bulk of their printer hardware profits from the ink cartridge refills.  If you regularly print 11""x14"" or 13""x19"" prints with this Pro-100, at the current price of about $17 per ink cartridge, using up a set of all eight ink cartridges will cost you about $125 to $135 to replace all eight refills.When using a sophisticated photo printer like this to print 13""x19"" photos, you should likewise use a camera that is better than a $200 point-and-shoot camera.  This printer's output quality is ideally suited for photos shot using a better SLR camera.  And instead of printing photos directly from an iPad via AirPrint or directly from a Canon camera via PictBridge, you should carefully review and select your photos on the computer first, applying post-processing edits, aligning/straightening/cropping, sharpening, and other enhancements as needed.  As with the computer lingo of ""garbage in, garbage out"", if your photo is not sharp or if your camera's autofocus locked onto a tree that was behind the person you were photographing, this printer will expose those problems far more if you output a 13""x19"" print than what can be noticed on a 4""x6"" print.  I never print smaller than 8""X10"" prints using this Pro-100 printer, and I certainly do not print text documents on this Pro-100, because printing small 4""x6"" photos is both a waste of this printer's capabilities and is a waste of its beautiful pricey inks.  For printing 4""x6"" photos that I share with other people, using a less fancy inkjet photo printer or a printer/copier/fax multi-function inkjet printer suits me just fine.  I only use this Pro-100 for printing photos that will be framed, and my favorite sizes have been 8""x10"", 11""x14"", and 13""x19"".  Once I became addicted to printing beautifully colored and richly detailed 13""x19"" photos from this Pro-100, it is hard for me to go smaller than 8""x10"" now :-)Since you will likely be editing and adjusting your photos from your computer prior to printing them on this Pro-100, you should invest in some color calibration hardware if you are not already calibrating your monitor and printer.  So along with spending money on ink refills, expect to pay at least several hundred dollars for calibration hardware.  If you edit your photos on your computer, viewing them on an uncalibrated laptop/display screen, and then send the images to this printer, the coloration of the resulting prints may be different from the images that you were looking at on the screen.  Datacolor and X-Rite both make excellent color calibration tools.  Both the Datacolor Spyder Studio S4SSR100 and X-Rite CMUNPH ColorMunki Photo are great for ensuring that the display screens, printer, printer ink, and printer paper that you use are all calibrated together so you get exacting control over the how the image will look in going from your computer onto the printed page.  Although I have both the Spyder and ColorMunki tools, I personally prefer Datacolor's Spyder more than ColorMunki.  If you are thinking ""Whoa, this calibration gear can cost more than a new Pro-100!  I just want to print my photos the way that my camera captured them!"",  you can still usually get excellent print results without calibration by using Canon inks and Canon papers with this printer... and as long as you get a visual feel for how light/dark/green/blue/red/yellow your images appear on the screen when compared to how they print out.  But if you are a graphic artist or you want to adjust the colors/hues/saturation/brightness in Photoshop, calibrating your display screens to produce custom monitor profiles and calibrating the printer to get a custom printer profile will ensure that what you see is what you end up printing.  So while using this printer to get professional lab-quality prints may not be a lot cheaper than paying a high-quality photo lab, printing at home does offers a more immediate and convenient printing of photos combined with the ability to precisely control how your prints will appear on paper.Also introduced in this Pro-100 is a new ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in that provides a printer interface to Photoshop CS/Elements/Lightroom and Canon's own Digital Photo Professional (version 2.1 or later).  If you are printing from either Adobe's or Canon's software, this plug-in lets you adjust printer settings, manage color settings (e.g. via an ICC profile), etc.  If you mainly just change some common print options using the standard Microsoft Windows printer pop-up windows, the large number of options available in this ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in may be a bit bewildering.  After all, both this printer and the ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in are targeted towards professional-level photographers.  Luckily, most of the default settings in this plug-in provide for a good starting point.  But for people who are accustomed to tweaking specific color profiles and printer profiles, these available adjustments should be reasonably easy to set up and the options are nicely grouped together in logical functionally related layouts.Other software packaged with this printer include a ""Easy Photo Print"" and an image filters application that lets you apply basic special effects to your photos, along with tools to print onto CDs and CD/DVD case covers.  This printer includes a tray to hold a CD or DVD so you can use this printer, along with the included ""Easy Photo Print"" software, to easily print professional-looking disc labels.  The color labels that are directly printed onto the CD/DVD may have the inks smear and smudge if they get wet, unless you use a water-resistant disc like Taiyo Yuden/JVC WaterShield (in fact, *all* of Taiyo Yuden/JVC CD and DVD media are excellent in general).Upon opening this printer's large shipping box, I was able to fully set up this printer for wireless Wi-Fi printing, including installation of all software, after a little over one hour's time.  All of the contents inside the shipping box were neatly packed together with lots of tape holding various parts and pieces in place.  This printer has impeccable build quality, with an excellent fit and finish, and it is a very solid piece of equipment.  Any large-format photo printer like this will not be compact in size, and this Pro-100's size of 27.2""x8.6""x15.2"" (Width-Height-Depth) needs extra room on a desk or table.  In particular, the 27-inch width is wider than many large-format photo printers that can output 13""x19"" prints.  And Canon's Pro-1 is still even larger in size.  Connecting this printer using the supplied USB cable is the easiest setup method.  My iPad also easily detected this printer's AirPrint capability.  The included software guides you through either the USB or network connection menus.  To initiate the connection to the printer, you press and hold down the [Resume/Cancel] button and then let it flash 6 times for a wireless WPS connection or let it flash 11 times for a wired USB connection.  This printer connection setup process is quite cumbersome, but its wireless printing is very reliable once it has been configured.  If your wireless access point or router is not able to connect to this printer using the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) mode, a more reliable approach is to choose the ""Wireless Setup Using the USB cable"" connection method that Canon's software also offers as a setup option.The print quality of this printer is excellent, even when compared to other dedicated photo printers.  A dye-based printer like this will naturally produce better color saturation than a pigment-based printer such as Canon's Pro-1 or Pro-10, or Epson's R3000.  But a pigment-based printer will usually produce deeper blacks and dark tones.  This Pro-100 is an excellent printer especially for landscape and nature photography because the colors are very rich and saturated.  However, when printing portraits, skin tones can sometimes appear a bit ruddy or suntanned.  I think that this is more due to the natural characteristics of dye inks, and not an issue with the color accuracy of the printer itself.  The printer is not changing the hues of the skin by adding too much red color, but the existing flesh tones, and all colors in general, may be slightly more saturated than what is depicted in the actual images when using a dye-based inkjet printer.  Slightly oversaturated skin colors in people are more noticeable than extra saturation of colors in animals, objects, landscapes, and nature scenery.  In fact, if you show people two landscape/nature/floral photos where one photo accurately depicts all colors and the other photo shows the same scene but with more color saturation, most people will prefer the more colorful saturated photo than the photo with accurate colors.  But the ""more colorful is better"" preference does not apply to extra saturation of skin colors.  By slightly toning down the saturation of my photos that contain people in them prior to printing, I can get more natural skin tones on my prints from this Pro-100.  For printing portraits and photos that include people in them, I reduce the saturation of the skin areas by about 5% to 10%.  But for printing landscape and nature photos, the rich coloration is quite appealing, so I usually do not reduce the saturation levels on most of my landscape and floral images.  For a photo of people surrounded by colorful scenery, I often slightly decrease the saturation just on the skin areas while letting the surrounding background stay the same.  For photos that I have processed through HDR, which are usually a bit more saturated, I may reduce saturation by 5% or as much as 10% prior to printing them on this Pro-100.  And most of my HDR-processed photos are far less saturated than many people's HDR processing since I prefer more natural and realistic-looking HDR-processed images instead of the wildly colored HDR images of some people that I think are tiresome to look at.  If you normally post-process your photos to be heavily saturated in colors, you should take into consideration that a dye-based printer like this Pro-100 will slightly bump up the saturation even more when compared to a pigment-based printer. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Dye-based inks previously were not as colorfast as pigment-based inks over the long term.  But the technology has improved so the dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years.  You can expect excellent results for both image quality and color longevity if you use Canon's Pro Platinum, Luster, or Premium Photo Gloss or Semi-Gloss papers with this Pro-100 printer.  Dye-based inks do not perform as well on porous matte photo papers and other uncoated fine art papers.  If that is your preferred printer paper, instead of using a semi-gloss or gloss paper, then a pigment-based ink printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1 may be better suited for your photo paper preferences.  The longevity of all printed photos depends upon various factors such as whether the photo is protected in a frame or photo album (longer life) or is frequently handled (shorter life), whether the photo is framed (shorter life) or stored inside a photo album (longer life), and whether the framed photo is exposed to bright light (more fading) or displayed more in the shade (less fading).  Dye inks are absorbed into the paper, whereas pigment inks stick to the surface as small pigment particles that are not absorbed into the paper.  Using a t-shirt analogy, dye printer inks are like a t-shirt design that has dyes soaked into the cotton while pigment printer inks are like a t-shirt design that uses an iron-on applique.  Because of this, pigment inks are more easily damaged due to scratches, chipping, or flaking, whereas a dye ink photo can be framed or mounted without glass covering it and it will be more resistant to damage.  However, if a dye-printed page is exposed to water or high humidity, since dye inks easily dissolve in water, the dye ink photo can smear, bleed, or fade, whereas pigment inks are more resistant to water because they stick tighter to the surface of the page and will bleed less if exposed to moisture.  Dye-based inks previously could produce a much wider color gamut than pigment-based inks.  But just as dye inks have caught up to the colorfast longevity of pigment inks, pigment inks have now caught up to the wide color gamut that was previously an exclusive advantage of dye inks.Overall, the detail, resolution, and color accuracy of this Pro-100 are superb, worthy of gallery displays and at least as good as, or better than, prints that you order from a drug store or retail department store.  As mentioned, if you want incrementally better color accuracy and resolution and better black-and-white prints that compare favorably to the high-end prints offered by photo labs, you have to step up to the Pro-10 or Pro-1 printers.  If most of your photography involves people, portraits, weddings, etc, you may also want to consider the Pro-10 or Pro-1 because their pigment-based inks produce more natural looking skin tones, unless you reduce the saturation on the skin areas prior to printing on this Pro-100, or you can also create custom profiles by calibrating this printer's output along with the display monitor and printer paper being used.  I should emphasize that the deeper saturation of colors on this dye-based inkjet printer is not glaringly noticeable on the skin colors of all photos that I print out, but the subtle difference is more noticeable if I compare a people/portrait image printed on this Pro-100 and place the print right next to the same image printed on Canon's Pro-1 pigment-based inkjet printer.  Dye-based printers just have a slightly different look and feel than pigment-based printers.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies! Positives: This printer can output superb gallery-quality prints with exceptional detail and resolution, while being significantly less expensive than the higher-end Pro-10 and Pro-1 printer models. This Pro-100 prints better blacks and grays on monochrome prints than the older Pro9000 printer that it replaces. The new wireless connectivity options of using 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi or Apple's AirPrint, along with a wired Ethernet option, provide flexibility of shared usage and printer placement by not needing to be physically connected to a USB cable. The dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years. Negatives: While black-and-white prints are better than the previous Pro9000 printer, monochrome output is still inferior to the pricier Pro-10 and Pro-1 printers.If you have never used a prosumer-level dedicated photo printer like this before, prepare to be surprised... both by the size and weight of this printer's box and by the stunning quality of color photos that you can print out, with exceptional detail and resolution even if you press your nose close to a 13""x19"" print.  Weighing a very hefty 56 pounds in its shipping box, the box that this printer is shipped in resembles a two-drawer file cabinet laying on its side (and it is heavier than most empty two-drawer file cabinets).  This printer was shipped to me in its original Canon box package; the big box was not placed inside another bigger Amazon box.Having previously used Canon's excellent PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II printer, this Pro-100 printer has a number of differences and improvements over that older model.  First of all, this Pro-100 is bigger in size and about 10 to 12 pounds heavier than the Pro9000.  Along with the USB 2.0 cable connection and Wireless PictBridge connection to Canon cameras that are also used in the older Pro9000 printer, this Pro-100 also adds wireless AirPrint printing from iPad/iPhone/iOS devices and, most significantly, both wireless 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet printing from your LAN.  While the ability to print directly and wirelessly from an iPad or Canon camera is useful, I think that for a professional-grade photo printer like this, most people will want to view, edit, adjust, and tweak their photos on their computer first before printing them, so being able to add this printer to my router's wireless LAN is a huge convenience, making it easy to both share the printer between different laptop and desktop computers on the LAN, and to have extra freedom in placing this large printer in an optimum location.While both the Pro9000 and this Pro-100 use eight ink cartridges, the Pro9000's black/cyan/photo-cyan/magenta/photo-magenta/yellow/red/green colors are now represented as black/gray/light-gray/cyan/photo-cyan/magenta/photo-magenta/yellow in this Pro-100, with three inks dedicated to blacks and grays instead of just the one black ink cartridge on the Pro9000, resulting in noticeably better black-and-white monochrome prints on this Pro-100 when compared to the Pro9000.The 10-cartridge Pro-10 printer also has three black/gray colors along with adding a red color back into the mix, while the 12-cartridge top-of-the-line Pro-1 dedicates five ink cartridges to black/gray colors.  If you mainly print a lot of black-and-white photos, you should seriously consider spending the extra money on the Pro-1.  While the Pro-1 has better overall color resolution than this Pro-100, one of the Pro-1's greatest strengths is in the range of blacks and grays that it can accurately print.  High-resolution monochrome prints are one of the toughest tests of photo printers since some inkjet printers leak a slight bit of color cast onto black-and-white prints while other inkjets do not offer enough grayscale resolution, and this Pro-100 is not consistently perfect with its black-and-white output and its printing of the deepest black regions.  While this Pro-100 prints better grays and blacks than what the Pro9000 prints, both Canon's Pro-1 and Epson's R3000 can print noticeably superior black-and-white prints when compared to this Pro-100 monochrome prints.  These are not glaring deficiencies in the print quality, but there are subtle differences in the accuracy and resolution of black and gray color gradations when you compare an image printed on this Pro-100 with the same image printed on the Pro-1.Although I have not precisely measured how long each ink cartridge lasts when printing the same photo each time, I have always believed that Epson's printers drink up their ink faster than either Canon or HP inkjet printers, and Epson ink cartridges seem to be more prone to clogging, both on Epson's photo printers and their printer/copier/fax multi-function printers.  On average, I get about 7 to 10 large 13""x19"" color prints from this Pro-100 before I have to replace some of the color ink cartridges.  This is comparable to the previous Pro9000 printer.  The more expensive Pro-1 uses ink cartridges that are almost three times larger in ink volume, and its colors are distributed across 12 ink cartridges versus the 8 cartridges used by this Pro-100.  So this Pro-100 needs more frequent ink replacements than the Pro-1 printer, although it uses up the ink at a rate that is comparable to the older Pro9000 printer.  But I seem to replace ink cartridges more frequently on Epson inkjet printers than on Canon printers.  As with ""razor blade marketing"", I think that all inkjet printer manufacturers earn the bulk of their printer hardware profits from the ink cartridge refills.  If you regularly print 11""x14"" or 13""x19"" prints with this Pro-100, at the current price of about $17 per ink cartridge, using up a set of all eight ink cartridges will cost you about $125 to $135 to replace all eight refills.When using a sophisticated photo printer like this to print 13""x19"" photos, you should likewise use a camera that is better than a $200 point-and-shoot camera.  This printer's output quality is ideally suited for photos shot using a better SLR camera.  And instead of printing photos directly from an iPad via AirPrint or directly from a Canon camera via PictBridge, you should carefully review and select your photos on the computer first, applying post-processing edits, aligning/straightening/cropping, sharpening, and other enhancements as needed.  As with the computer lingo of ""garbage in, garbage out"", if your photo is not sharp or if your camera's autofocus locked onto a tree that was behind the person you were photographing, this printer will expose those problems far more if you output a 13""x19"" print than what can be noticed on a 4""x6"" print.  I never print smaller than 8""X10"" prints using this Pro-100 printer, and I certainly do not print text documents on this Pro-100, because printing small 4""x6"" photos is both a waste of this printer's capabilities and is a waste of its beautiful pricey inks.  For printing 4""x6"" photos that I share with other people, using a less fancy inkjet photo printer or a printer/copier/fax multi-function inkjet printer suits me just fine.  I only use this Pro-100 for printing photos that will be framed, and my favorite sizes have been 8""x10"", 11""x14"", and 13""x19"".  Once I became addicted to printing beautifully colored and richly detailed 13""x19"" photos from this Pro-100, it is hard for me to go smaller than 8""x10"" now :-)Since you will likely be editing and adjusting your photos from your computer prior to printing them on this Pro-100, you should invest in some color calibration hardware if you are not already calibrating your monitor and printer.  So along with spending money on ink refills, expect to pay at least several hundred dollars for calibration hardware.  If you edit your photos on your computer, viewing them on an uncalibrated laptop/display screen, and then send the images to this printer, the coloration of the resulting prints may be different from the images that you were looking at on the screen.  Datacolor and X-Rite both make excellent color calibration tools.  Both the Datacolor Spyder Studio S4SSR100 and X-Rite CMUNPH ColorMunki Photo are great for ensuring that the display screens, printer, printer ink, and printer paper that you use are all calibrated together so you get exacting control over the how the image will look in going from your computer onto the printed page.  Although I have both Spyder and ColorMunki calibration tools, I prefer Datacolor's Spyder more than X-Rite's ColorMunki.  X-Rite's hardware, overall, is faster than Datacolor's hardware, but I think that Datacolor's software is far better than X-Rite's software with respect to software features, quality, and stability.If you are thinking: ""Whoa, this display and printer calibration gear can cost more than a new Pro-100!  I just want to print my photos the way that my camera captured them!"", you can still usually get excellent print results without calibration by using Canon inks and Canon papers with this printer.  You can also get a visual feel for how light/dark/red/green/blue/yellow your images appear on the screen when compared to how they print out by holding a large print next to your monitor displaying the same image.  Some people adjust color hues and temperatures by visually comparing printed output to the screen display, using a combination of soft-proofing and hardcopy proofing.  This is combined with using the paper profiles supplied by Canon or the manufacturer of the printer paper you are using.  While that approach helps to prevent too much discrepancy between what is displayed on screen and what is printed, it is also fraught with potential human error and variations as you switch papers and inks, as your monitor ages and shifts in its color response, and as the brightness and subtle hues of the ambient room lighting change in between each visual screen-to-print comparison.  In addition, an image on a monitor projects additive colors through its pixels, whereas an image on a print is subtractive in that it absorbs and reflects ambient light, and this can significantly alter your visual comparison of hues and contrast when comparing the same image between display and print.If you are a graphic artist or you want to control the colors/hues/saturation/brightness in Photoshop, calibrating your display screen to produce custom monitor profiles and calibrating the printer to get a custom ICC printer profile is the best way to ensure that what you see on screen is what you end up printing.  Only by generating a custom printer profile can you accurately connect the dots between your display, your printer (which can also have variations in print output even between two printers of the same model), your ink, and your paper.  Because a display monitor's color response slowly shifts as it ages, you should calibrate a newer display every one or two months and calibrate an older display every two weeks.  As anyone who has ever painted the inside of a house realizes, each gallon can or custom-mix of a specific paint color can have slight variations that make it visibly different in between batches.  The same variation can happen in between batches of printer paper and ink cartridges made by the same manufacturer.  So to take into account these variations in printer-ink-paper combinations, you should generate a new custom printer profile every time that you switch to a new package of paper and every time that you replace ink cartridges.Also introduced in this Pro-100 is a new ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in that provides a printer interface to Photoshop CS/Elements/Lightroom and Canon's own Digital Photo Professional (version 2.1 or later).  If you are printing from either Adobe's or Canon's software, this plug-in lets you adjust printer settings, manage color settings (e.g. via an ICC profile), etc.  If you mainly just change some common print options using the standard Microsoft Windows printer pop-up windows, the large number of options available in this ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in may be a bit bewildering.  After all, both this printer and the ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in are targeted towards professional-level photographers.  Luckily, most of the default settings in this plug-in provide for a good starting point.  But for people who are accustomed to tweaking specific color profiles and printer profiles, these available adjustments should be reasonably easy to set up and the options are nicely grouped together in logical functionally related layouts.Other software packaged with this printer include a ""Easy Photo Print"" and an image filters application that lets you apply basic special effects to your photos, along with tools to print onto CDs and CD/DVD case covers.  This printer includes a tray to hold a CD or DVD so you can use this printer, along with the included ""Easy Photo Print"" software, to easily print professional-looking disc labels.  The color labels that are directly printed onto the CD/DVD may have the inks smear and smudge if they get wet, unless you use a water-resistant disc like Taiyo Yuden/JVC WaterShield (in fact, *all* of Taiyo Yuden/JVC CD and DVD media are excellent in general).Upon opening this printer's large shipping box, I was able to fully set up this printer for wireless Wi-Fi printing, including installation of all software, after a little over one hour's time.  All of the contents inside the shipping box were neatly packed together with lots of tape holding various parts and pieces in place.  This printer has impeccable build quality, with an excellent fit and finish, and it is a very solid piece of equipment.  Any large-format photo printer like this will not be compact in size, and this Pro-100's size of 27.2""x8.6""x15.2"" (Width-Height-Depth) needs extra room on a desk or table.  In particular, the 27-inch width is wider than many large-format photo printers that can output 13""x19"" prints.  And Canon's Pro-1 is still even larger in size.  I have my Pro-100 placed sideways on top of a two-drawer file cabinet.After installing the included software, you should go to Canon's Web site to check if there are updated versions of firmware, drivers, and software.  This really applies to any kind of software that you install; periodically check for new updates or patches that can be downloaded from the software company's Web site, first verifying that the updates are newer than what you have installed and that the updates apply to your specific setup.  Whenever I install new software, I immediately check for new software, firmware, or driver updates or patches before I begin to use the software.  Some software updates are major and can overwrite or reset any changes that you have configured in the software, so it is best to download and apply all new updates before proceeding to use the software.  As with the software and firmware for their cameras, Canon frequently releases updates that may include bug fixes or extra features.  For example, there are Pro-100 software updates on Canon's Web site that add support for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 along with support for more paper types.Connecting this printer using the supplied USB cable is the easiest setup method.  My iPad also easily detected this printer's AirPrint capability.  The included software guides you through either the USB or network connection menus.  To initiate the connection to the printer, you press and hold down the [Resume/Cancel] button and then let it flash 6 times for a wireless WPS connection or let it flash 11 times for a wired USB connection.  This printer connection setup process is quite cumbersome, but its wireless printing is very reliable once it has been configured.  Canon needs to make the setup software and connection configuration easier and quicker to use.  If your wireless access point or router is not able to connect to this printer using the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) mode, a more reliable approach is to choose the ""Wireless Setup Using the USB cable"" connection method that Canon's software also offers as a setup option.  If you do encounter problems during setup of the printer or configuration of the printer's network connection, you can phone Canon's customer service at 1-800-OK-CANON (1-800-652-2666) Monday through Friday 10:00AM to 10:00PM EST, and you can talk to their knowledgeable staff who have good English skills.The print quality of this printer is excellent, even when compared to other dedicated photo printers.  A dye-based printer like this will naturally produce better color saturation than a pigment-based printer such as Canon's Pro-1 or Pro-10, or Epson's R3000.  But a pigment-based printer will usually produce deeper blacks and dark tones.  This Pro-100 is an excellent printer especially for landscape and nature photography because the colors are very rich and saturated.  However, when printing portraits, skin tones can sometimes appear a bit ruddy or suntanned.  I think that this is more due to the natural characteristics of dye inks, and not an issue with the color accuracy of the printer itself.  The printer is not changing the hues of the skin by adding too much red color, but the existing flesh tones, and all colors in general, may be slightly more saturated than what is depicted in the actual images when using a dye-based inkjet printer.  Slightly oversaturated skin colors in people are more noticeable than extra saturation of colors in animals, objects, landscapes, and nature scenery.  In fact, if you show people two landscape/nature/floral photos where one photo accurately depicts all colors and the other photo shows the same scene but with more color saturation, most people will prefer the more colorful saturated photo than the photo with accurate colors.  But the ""more colorful is better"" preference does not apply to extra saturation of skin colors.  By slightly toning down the saturation of my photos that contain people in them prior to printing, I can get more natural skin tones on my prints from this Pro-100.  For printing portraits and photos that include people in them, I reduce the saturation of the skin areas by about 5% to 10%.  But for printing landscape and nature photos, the rich coloration is quite appealing, so I usually do not reduce the saturation levels on most of my landscape and floral images.  For a photo of people surrounded by colorful scenery, I often slightly decrease the saturation just on the skin areas while letting the surrounding background stay the same.  For photos that I have processed through HDR, which are usually a bit more saturated, I may reduce saturation by 5% or as much as 10% prior to printing them on this Pro-100.  And most of my HDR-processed photos are far less saturated than many people's HDR processing since I prefer more natural and realistic-looking HDR-processed images instead of the wildly colored HDR images of some people that I think are tiresome to look at.  If you normally post-process your photos to have extra color saturation, keep in mind that a dye-based printer like this Pro-100 will slightly bump up the saturation even more when compared to a pigment-based printer. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Dye-based inks previously were not as colorfast as pigment-based inks over the long term.  But the technology has improved so the dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years.  You can expect excellent results for both image quality and color longevity if you use Canon's Pro Platinum, Luster, or Premium Photo Gloss or Semi-Gloss papers with this Pro-100 printer.  Dye-based inks do not perform as well on porous matte photo papers and other uncoated fine art papers.  If that is your preferred printer paper, instead of using a semi-gloss or gloss paper, then a pigment-based ink printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1 may be better suited for your photo paper preferences.  The longevity of all printed photos depends upon various factors such as whether the photo is protected in a frame or photo album (longer life) or is frequently handled (shorter life), whether the photo is framed (shorter life) or stored inside a photo album (longer life), and whether the framed photo is exposed to bright light (more fading) or displayed more in the shade (less fading).  Dye inks are absorbed into the paper, whereas pigment inks stick to the surface as small pigment particles that are not absorbed into the paper.  Using a t-shirt analogy, dye printer inks are like a t-shirt design that has dyes soaked into the cotton while pigment printer inks are like a t-shirt design that uses an iron-on applique.  Because of this, pigment inks are more easily damaged due to scratches, chipping, or flaking, whereas a dye ink photo can be framed or mounted without glass covering it and it will be more resistant to mechanical damage.  However, if a dye-printed page is exposed to water or high humidity, since dye inks easily dissolve in water, the dye ink photo can smear, bleed, or fade, whereas pigment inks are more resistant to water because they stick tighter to the surface of the page and will bleed less if exposed to moisture.  The appearance of dye-ink prints can be affected by the texture of the paper being used, taking on some of the characteristics of the paper, whereas pigment-based prints look more consistent across all kinds of printer paper.  Dye-based inks previously could produce a much wider color gamut than pigment-based inks.  But just as dye inks have caught up to the colorfast longevity of pigment inks, pigment inks have now caught up to the wide color gamut that was previously an exclusive advantage of dye inks.Overall, the detail, resolution, and color accuracy of this Pro-100 are superb, worthy of gallery displays and at least as good as, or better than, prints that you order from a drug store or retail department store.  I print a lot of 11""x14"" and 13""x19"" photos of my nature, landscape, and macro photography that I frame, give as gifts, and hang on walls around my house, and visitors are often surprised that I printed these photos at home instead of using a commercial service.  With a simple black frame and a white wall background, each large print looks glorious with its rich colors and fine detail.  From a cost perspective, if you also take into account the cost of display and printer calibration hardware and replacing expensive ink cartridges, using this Pro-100 to get professional lab-quality large-format prints may not be much cheaper than paying a high-quality commercial photo lab.  But printing at home does offer a more immediate and convenient printing of photos and, if you calibrate both your display and printer, you can have more precise control over how your prints will look with the specific papers you are using.  Even if you do decide to send most of your images to commercial photo labs for printing, calibrating your monitor will assure that the colors you are viewing and editing are accurately displayed.  So if color accuracy is important to you, monitor calibration is a must.As mentioned, if you want incrementally better color accuracy and resolution and better black-and-white prints that compare favorably to the high-end prints offered by photo labs, you have to step up to the Pro-10 or Pro-1 printers.  But those two printers cost two to three times more than this Pro-100, so this Pro-100 may be totally sufficient for most amateur photographers unless, again, most of your photography is black-and-white, in which case I would recommend the Pro-1.  If most of your photography involves portraits and weddings, you may also want to consider the Pro-10 or Pro-1 because their pigment-based inks produce slightly more natural-looking skin tones, unless you sometimes slightly reduce the saturation on the skin areas prior to printing on this Pro-100, or you can also create custom profiles by calibrating this printer's output along with the display monitor and printer paper being used.  I should emphasize that the slightly deeper saturation of colors on this dye-based inkjet printer is not very noticeable on the skin colors of all photos that I print out, but the subtle differences are more noticeable if I compare an image showing close-ups of faces printed on this Pro-100 and place the Pro-100 print right next to the same image printed on Canon's Pro-1 pigment-based inkjet printer.  And you may actually prefer the slightly richer skin tones printed by the Pro-100 when compared to a pigment-based printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1.  Dye-based printers just have a slightly different look and feel than pigment-based printers.  Other than those two caveats, the quality of the photo prints from this Pro-100 should satisfy all but the most discerning amateur photographers.  I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions.  I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHD768Z4AE72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CB04INC#wasThisHelpful","R1VHD768Z4AE72","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Both the Datacolor Spyder Studio S4SSR100 and X-Rite CMUNPH ColorMunki Photo are great for ensuring that the display screens, printer, printer ink, and printer paper that you use are all calibrated together so you get exacting control over the how the image will look in going from your computer onto the printed page.  Although I have both Spyder and ColorMunki calibration tools, I prefer Datacolor's Spyder more than X-Rite's ColorMunki.  X-Rite's hardware, overall, is faster than Datacolor's hardware, but I think that Datacolor's software is far better than X-Rite's software with respect to software features, quality, and stability.If you are thinking: ""Whoa, this display and printer calibration gear can cost more than a new Pro-100!  I just want to print my photos the way that my camera captured them!"", you can still usually get excellent print results without calibration by using Canon inks and Canon papers with this printer.  You can also get a visual feel for how light/dark/red/green/blue/yellow your images appear on the screen when compared to how they print out by holding a large print next to your monitor displaying the same image.  Some people adjust color hues and temperatures by visually comparing printed output to the screen display, using a combination of soft-proofing and hardcopy proofing.  This is combined with using the paper profiles supplied by Canon or the manufacturer of the printer paper you are using.  While that approach helps to prevent too much discrepancy between what is displayed on screen and what is printed, it is also fraught with potential human error and variations as you switch papers and inks, as your monitor ages and shifts in its color response, and as the brightness and subtle hues of the ambient room lighting change in between each visual screen-to-print comparison.  In addition, an image on a monitor projects additive colors through its pixels, whereas an image on a print is subtractive in that it absorbs and reflects ambient light, and this can significantly alter your visual comparison of hues and contrast when comparing the same image between display and print.If you are a graphic artist or you want to control the colors/hues/saturation/brightness in Photoshop, calibrating your display screen to produce custom monitor profiles and calibrating the printer to get a custom ICC printer profile is the best way to ensure that what you see on screen is what you end up printing.  Only by generating a custom printer profile can you accurately connect the dots between your display, your printer (which can also have variations in print output even between two printers of the same model), your ink, and your paper.  Because a display monitor's color response slowly shifts as it ages, you should calibrate a newer display every one or two months and calibrate an older display every two weeks.  As anyone who has ever painted the inside of a house realizes, each gallon can or custom-mix of a specific paint color can have slight variations that make it visibly different in between batches.  The same variation can happen in between batches of printer paper and ink cartridges made by the same manufacturer.  So to take into account these variations in printer-ink-paper combinations, you should generate a new custom printer profile every time that you switch to a new package of paper and every time that you replace ink cartridges.Also introduced in this Pro-100 is a new ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in that provides a printer interface to Photoshop CS/Elements/Lightroom and Canon's own Digital Photo Professional (version 2.1 or later).  If you are printing from either Adobe's or Canon's software, this plug-in lets you adjust printer settings, manage color settings (e.g. via an ICC profile), etc.  If you mainly just change some common print options using the standard Microsoft Windows printer pop-up windows, the large number of options available in this ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in may be a bit bewildering.  After all, both this printer and the ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in are targeted towards professional-level photographers.  Luckily, most of the default settings in this plug-in provide for a good starting point.  But for people who are accustomed to tweaking specific color profiles and printer profiles, these available adjustments should be reasonably easy to set up and the options are nicely grouped together in logical functionally related layouts.Other software packaged with this printer include a ""Easy Photo Print"" and an image filters application that lets you apply basic special effects to your photos, along with tools to print onto CDs and CD/DVD case covers.  This printer includes a tray to hold a CD or DVD so you can use this printer, along with the included ""Easy Photo Print"" software, to easily print professional-looking disc labels.  The color labels that are directly printed onto the CD/DVD may have the inks smear and smudge if they get wet, unless you use a water-resistant disc like Taiyo Yuden/JVC WaterShield (in fact, *all* of Taiyo Yuden/JVC CD and DVD media are excellent in general).Upon opening this printer's large shipping box, I was able to fully set up this printer for wireless Wi-Fi printing, including installation of all software, after a little over one hour's time.  All of the contents inside the shipping box were neatly packed together with lots of tape holding various parts and pieces in place.  This printer has impeccable build quality, with an excellent fit and finish, and it is a very solid piece of equipment.  Any large-format photo printer like this will not be compact in size, and this Pro-100's size of 27.2""x8.6""x15.2"" (Width-Height-Depth) needs extra room on a desk or table.  In particular, the 27-inch width is wider than many large-format photo printers that can output 13""x19"" prints.  And Canon's Pro-1 is still even larger in size.  I have my Pro-100 placed sideways on top of a two-drawer file cabinet.After installing the included software, you should go to Canon's Web site to check if there are updated versions of firmware, drivers, and software.  This really applies to any kind of software that you install; periodically check for new updates or patches that can be downloaded from the software company's Web site, first verifying that the updates are newer than what you have installed and that the updates apply to your specific setup.  Whenever I install new software, I immediately check for new software, firmware, or driver updates or patches before I begin to use the software.  Some software updates are major and can overwrite or reset any changes that you have configured in the software, so it is best to download and apply all new updates before proceeding to use the software.  As with the software and firmware for their cameras, Canon frequently releases updates that may include bug fixes or extra features.  For example, there are Pro-100 software updates on Canon's Web site that add support for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 along with support for more paper types.Connecting this printer using the supplied USB cable is the easiest setup method.  My iPad also easily detected this printer's AirPrint capability.  The included software guides you through either the USB or network connection menus.  To initiate the connection to the printer, you press and hold down the [Resume/Cancel] button and then let it flash 6 times for a wireless WPS connection or let it flash 11 times for a wired USB connection.  This printer connection setup process is quite cumbersome, but its wireless printing is very reliable once it has been configured.  Canon needs to make the setup software and connection configuration easier and quicker to use.  If your wireless access point or router is not able to connect to this printer using the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) mode, a more reliable approach is to choose the ""Wireless Setup Using the USB cable"" connection method that Canon's software also offers as a setup option.  If you do encounter problems during setup of the printer or configuration of the printer's network connection, you can phone Canon's customer service at 1-800-OK-CANON (1-800-652-2666) Monday through Friday 10:00AM to 10:00PM EST, and you can talk to their knowledgeable staff who have good English skills.The print quality of this printer is excellent, even when compared to other dedicated photo printers.  A dye-based printer like this will naturally produce better color saturation than a pigment-based printer such as Canon's Pro-1 or Pro-10, or Epson's R3000.  But a pigment-based printer will usually produce deeper blacks and dark tones.  This Pro-100 is an excellent printer especially for landscape and nature photography because the colors are very rich and saturated.  However, when printing portraits, skin tones can sometimes appear a bit ruddy or suntanned.  I think that this is more due to the natural characteristics of dye inks, and not an issue with the color accuracy of the printer itself.  The printer is not changing the hues of the skin by adding too much red color, but the existing flesh tones, and all colors in general, may be slightly more saturated than what is depicted in the actual images when using a dye-based inkjet printer.  Slightly oversaturated skin colors in people are more noticeable than extra saturation of colors in animals, objects, landscapes, and nature scenery.  In fact, if you show people two landscape/nature/floral photos where one photo accurately depicts all colors and the other photo shows the same scene but with more color saturation, most people will prefer the more colorful saturated photo than the photo with accurate colors.  But the ""more colorful is better"" preference does not apply to extra saturation of skin colors.  By slightly toning down the saturation of my photos that contain people in them prior to printing, I can get more natural skin tones on my prints from this Pro-100.  For printing portraits and photos that include people in them, I reduce the saturation of the skin areas by about 5% to 10%.  But for printing landscape and nature photos, the rich coloration is quite appealing, so I usually do not reduce the saturation levels on most of my landscape and floral images.  For a photo of people surrounded by colorful scenery, I often slightly decrease the saturation just on the skin areas while letting the surrounding background stay the same.  For photos that I have processed through HDR, which are usually a bit more saturated, I may reduce saturation by 5% or as much as 10% prior to printing them on this Pro-100.  And most of my HDR-processed photos are far less saturated than many people's HDR processing since I prefer more natural and realistic-looking HDR-processed images instead of the wildly colored HDR images of some people that I think are tiresome to look at.  If you normally post-process your photos to have extra color saturation, keep in mind that a dye-based printer like this Pro-100 will slightly bump up the saturation even more when compared to a pigment-based printer. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Dye-based inks previously were not as colorfast as pigment-based inks over the long term.  But the technology has improved so the dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years.  You can expect excellent results for both image quality and color longevity if you use Canon's Pro Platinum, Luster, or Premium Photo Gloss or Semi-Gloss papers with this Pro-100 printer.  Dye-based inks do not perform as well on porous matte photo papers and other uncoated fine art papers.  If that is your preferred printer paper, instead of using a semi-gloss or gloss paper, then a pigment-based ink printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1 may be better suited for your photo paper preferences.  The longevity of all printed photos depends upon various factors such as whether the photo is protected in a frame or photo album (longer life) or is frequently handled (shorter life), whether the photo is framed (shorter life) or stored inside a photo album (longer life), and whether the framed photo is exposed to bright light (more fading) or displayed more in the shade (less fading).  Dye inks are absorbed into the paper, whereas pigment inks stick to the surface as small pigment particles that are not absorbed into the paper.  Using a t-shirt analogy, dye printer inks are like a t-shirt design that has dyes soaked into the cotton while pigment printer inks are like a t-shirt design that uses an iron-on applique.  Because of this, pigment inks are more easily damaged due to scratches, chipping, or flaking, whereas a dye ink photo can be framed or mounted without glass covering it and it will be more resistant to mechanical damage.  However, if a dye-printed page is exposed to water or high humidity, since dye inks easily dissolve in water, the dye ink photo can smear, bleed, or fade, whereas pigment inks are more resistant to water because they stick tighter to the surface of the page and will bleed less if exposed to moisture.  The appearance of dye-ink prints can be affected by the texture of the paper being used, taking on some of the characteristics of the paper, whereas pigment-based prints look more consistent across all kinds of printer paper.  Dye-based inks previously could produce a much wider color gamut than pigment-based inks.  But just as dye inks have caught up to the colorfast longevity of pigment inks, pigment inks have now caught up to the wide color gamut that was previously an exclusive advantage of dye inks.Overall, the detail, resolution, and color accuracy of this Pro-100 are superb, worthy of gallery displays and at least as good as, or better than, prints that you order from a drug store or retail department store.  I print a lot of 11""x14"" and 13""x19"" photos of my nature, landscape, and macro photography that I frame, give as gifts, and hang on walls around my house, and visitors are often surprised that I printed these photos at home instead of using a commercial service.  With a simple black frame and a white wall background, each large print looks glorious with its rich colors and fine detail.  From a cost perspective, if you also take into account the cost of display and printer calibration hardware and replacing expensive ink cartridges, using this Pro-100 to get professional lab-quality large-format prints may not be much cheaper than paying a high-quality commercial photo lab.  But printing at home does offer a more immediate and convenient printing of photos and, if you calibrate both your display and printer, you can have more precise control over how your prints will look with the specific papers you are using.  Even if you do decide to send most of your images to commercial photo labs for printing, calibrating your monitor will assure that the colors you are viewing and editing are accurately displayed.  So if color accuracy is important to you, monitor calibration is a must.As mentioned, if you want incrementally better color accuracy and resolution and better black-and-white prints that compare favorably to the high-end prints offered by photo labs, you have to step up to the Pro-10 or Pro-1 printers.  But those two printers cost two to three times more than this Pro-100, so this Pro-100 may be totally sufficient for most amateur photographers unless, again, most of your photography is black-and-white, in which case I would recommend the Pro-1.  If most of your photography involves portraits and weddings, you may also want to consider the Pro-10 or Pro-1 because their pigment-based inks produce slightly more natural-looking skin tones, unless you sometimes slightly reduce the saturation on the skin areas prior to printing on this Pro-100, or you can also create custom profiles by calibrating this printer's output along with the display monitor and printer paper being used.  I should emphasize that the slightly deeper saturation of colors on this dye-based inkjet printer is not very noticeable on the skin colors of all photos that I print out, but the subtle differences are more noticeable if I compare an image showing close-ups of faces printed on this Pro-100 and place the Pro-100 print right next to the same image printed on Canon's Pro-1 pigment-based inkjet printer.  And you may actually prefer the slightly richer skin tones printed by the Pro-100 when compared to a pigment-based printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1.  Dye-based printers just have a slightly different look and feel than pigment-based printers.  Other than those two caveats, the quality of the photo prints from this Pro-100 should satisfy all but the most discerning amateur photographers.  I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions.  I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFBHOKDDBQ50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CB03U68#wasThisHelpful","R2SFBHOKDDBQ50","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Not recommended. This product gives me cold pricklies. Positives: These gluten-free bars have high protein and fairly low fat, and there is no sugar added to them. The protein blend adds a healthy boost of calcium. Negatives: The salt content is way too high, which ruins the taste for me.  Many protein bars use less than 200mg of sodium in a 60-gram bar, instead of the 300mg of sodium in this bar. These are slightly pricey compared to similar high quality health-oriented protein bars.From the wrapper label:Nutrition Facts:Serving Size: 1 bar (60g)Calories: 240Fat Calories: 80Total Fat: 9g (14% DV)Saturated Fat: 3g (15% DV)Trans Fat: 0gCholesterol: <5mg (2% DV)Sodium: 300mg (13% DV)Total Carbohydrates: 23g (8% DV)Dietary Fiber: 1g (4% DV)Sugars: 0gSugar Alcohol: 12gProtein: 20gVitamin A: 0%Vitamin C: 0%Calcium: 10%Iron: 6%Ingredients: protein blend (whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, calcium caseinate, casein), coating (maltitol, cocoa butter, chocolate, sodium caseinate, milk fat, soy lecithin, natural flavors, salt), glycerin, maltitol, peanuts, water, canola oil, peanut flour, chicory fiber, sea salt, natural flavors, soy lecithin.Contains: milk, peanuts, soy.Manufactured in a plant that also processes eggs and tree nuts.While I like many of the other thinkThin flavors, the singular reason why I rate this ""Caramel Fudge"" bar only 2 stars is that it is way too salty compared to most health bars, snack bars, or even compared to many unhealthy candy bars.  I do not get to appreciate the caramel or fudge flavors.  From the first bite through the last bite, the only flavor that I really notice is the sea salt that is used.  Since many snack bars weigh about 40 grams, the 60-gram weight of these ""Caramel Fudge"" protein bars can satisfy your hunger during exercise.  You will like these protein bars more than me if you frequently like to eat salty foods.  Many 40-gram and 60-gram protein bars contain only 120 to 200 mg of sodium, whereas this bar contains 300 mg of sodium.  I think that the flavor of this bar would be far better if its sodium content was reduced by one third to one half.This protein bar has a bit of a mealy grainy texture to it that is common for protein bars made from whey, soy, and milk proteins.  I like its texture and I prefer a snack bar texture that is less sticky and gooey since most gooey snack bars are loaded with corn syrup.  In fact, one great nutritional aspect of this ""Caramel Fudge"" bar is that no extra sugar is added.  This bar does contain sugar alcohols in the form of maltitol.  Sugar alcohols are prepared from sugar, but they do not actually contain alcohol, and they have a mild sweetness to them.  Their names all end in ""ol"", such as maltitol, xylitol, and sorbitol.  But unlike sugar, sugar alcohols do not contribute to tooth decay and cavities.  Sugar alcohols do not contain as many calories as sugar, and if you are a diabetic, the consumption of sugar alcohols has less of an effect on your blood glucose level than other sugars and carbohydrates since they are incompletely absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestines.Because this vegetarian-friendly protein bar contains whey protein, soy protein, and milk (casein) protein, if you are allergic to either soy or dairy products, you should probably avoid this protein bar.  Whey protein may cause gas, bloating, cramps, fatigue, and headaches in some people.  Whey protein is derived from dairy sources, and if you have lactose intolerance, you may be more susceptible to these side effects from consuming whey protein.  And since this protein bar contains whey and milk protein, it is suitable for vegetarians like me, but not suitable for people on a vegan diet.  These thinkThin bars are compatible with people who have celiac disease or gluten intolerance, and they are also vegan-friendly. But if you are highly sensitive to soy, nuts, milk, or eggs, these bars may not be suitable for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PILS8NR435A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDINRM#wasThisHelpful","R14PILS8NR435A","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The outside is drizzled with a little chocolate with some crunchy bits.  I like its texture and I prefer a snack bar texture that is less sticky and gooey since most gooey snack bars are loaded with corn syrup.  Each one-bar serving has a good coverage of the most common essential vitamins: Vitamins A, C, E, Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folate, B12, Biotin, and Pantothenic Acid are all at 25% RDA.Because this vegetarian-friendly protein bar contains whey protein, milk protein, and soy protein, if you are allergic to either soy or dairy products, you should probably avoid this protein bar.

The reason that I rate this protein bar 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the 5 grams of fat (8% RDA, including 3.5 grams of saturated fat (18% RDA)), 14 grams of sugar, and 190 milligrams of sodium (8% RDA) are a bit high compared to some other healthy snack bars.  Although everyone's palate differs, I think that these protein bars would taste even better with less sodium added to each bar.  But then again, I also think that many restaurants add too much salt to their dishes too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GB2HJBZQUIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FAL73Y#wasThisHelpful","R29GB2HJBZQUIW","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: These gluten-free bars have a nice flavor that uses natural ingredients without resorting to the use of corn syrup. Negatives: The salt content is a bit on the high side for a health-conscious snack bar. These are slightly pricey compared to similar high quality health-oriented snack bars.From the wrapper label:Nutrition Facts:Serving Size: 1 bar (40g)Calories: 170Fat Calories: 80Total Fat: 8g (12% DV)Saturated Fat: 1g (5% DV)Trans Fat: 0gCholesterol: 0mg (0% DV)Sodium: 90mg (4% DV)Total Carbohydrates: 18g (6% DV)Dietary Fiber: 4g (16% DV)Sugars: 8gProtein: 8g (13% DV)Vitamin A: 0%Vitamin C: 0%Calcium: 4%Iron: 6%Ingredients: almonds, soy crisps (soy protein, tapioca starch), peanuts, dried cranberries (cranberries, pineapple juice, sugar, sunflower oil), brown rice syrup, chicory fiber, cashews, dextrose, dried apples, natural flavors, sunflower lecithin, citric acid, sea salt.Allergens: contains peanut, soy, almond, cashew.Manufactured in a plant that also processes tree nuts, milk, egg.Gluten free - 100% non-GMO (updated April 8, 2013)Even though this thinkThin ""Cranberry Apple Mixed Nuts"" flavor is from their ""Crunch"" bar product line, this is one of their least crunchy flavors.  The texture is far more chewy and slightly gooey than crunchy.  While I usually associate a chewy gooey snack bar as being loaded with sugar, this bar is actually fairly reasonable with its 8 grams of sugar and 80 fat calories.  While 80 fat calories out of 170 total calories may seem like a lot, if you read enough snack bar labels, you will notice that many of the very healthy snack bars still have their fat calories represent two-thirds of the total calories, instead of the fat calories being less than half of the total calories in this bar.I am particularly happy with the fact that corn syrup, and all its variants such as high-fructose corny syrup, is not used in these snack bars, and that these bars are not all loaded up with sugar.  Too many snack bars list corn syrup as one of their primary ingredients!  Researchers have linked the use of high-fructose corn syrup to rising rates of type 2 diabetes, and the United States has the most per-capita consumption of high-fructose corn syrup - a whopping 55 pounds of HFCS per person per year.  I am not a sugar addict and, personally, I think that these bars would have tasted just as good if they each had 4 to 6 grams of sugar, instead of 8 grams.  The salt content is notably on the high side at 90mg for a 40-gram bar.  There are some healthy snack bars that contain less than 30mg of salt in their 40-gram bars.This bar has a nice smell when I first opened the package.  Cranberry juice and apple juice are often mixed together in drinks, but for some reason, cranberries are less frequently combined with dried apples in a snack bar.  I can distinctly taste the cranberries in this bar, but the dried apples are far more subtle in their presence.  The dried apples to impart a different flavor to this snack bar when compared to other snack bars that combine cranberries with nuts without apples.  These thinkThin bars are compatible with people who have celiac disease or gluten intolerance, and they are also vegan-friendly.  But if you are highly sensitive to soy, nuts, milk, or eggs, these bars may not be suitable for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6VSDAT72HJPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDISI6#wasThisHelpful","R6VSDAT72HJPD","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: This 5400-RPM drive that utilizes 8-GB SSD smart-caching is a great upgrade to replace an existing 5400-RPM or PlayStation drive, as long as you frequently access applications and data files repeatedly. This 5400-RPM drive can perform almost as fast as many 7200-RPM drives, but it still cannot match SSD drive speeds. This drive runs very quietly and can just barely be heard most of the time. The 1-TB drive has a standard 9.5mm size suitable for most laptops, while the 500-GB version of this drive is 7.0mm size and may be a better fit for ultrabooks and thin laptops. This drive has a 3-year limited warranty. Negatives: Unlike some previous Seagate Momentus XT drives that combine flash memory caching with a 7200-RPM drive, this drive spins at 5400-RPM. In order to provide a robust speed boost that improves all usage scenarios, the SSD caching really needs to be increased to at least 24-GB or 32-GB in size, especially if you frequently work with graphics/photo/video/multimedia files. Even though it uses a 5400-RPM hard drive, this Seagate SSHD consumes almost as much energy as some regular 7200-RPM hard drives, or about 40% to 80% more energy than some of the better energy-efficient 5400-RPM mobile hard drives on the market. While this drive does noticeably improve the boot time during a cold boot, the speed-up when waking up from hibernation mode is only slightly quicker. Both with performance and price, this drive may not be better than buying a 1-TB 7200-RPM drive.This solid state hybrid drive combines 8-GB of MLC (Multi-Level Cell) NAND flash memory with a conventional 1-TB 5400-RPM hard drive that has 64-MB of DRAM read/write buffer cache.  The flash memory's firmware provides intelligent smart-caching so that recently or frequently used files are stored in the faster flash memory instead of needing to always access the slower spinning hard drive, and the firmware learns and tries to predict which files you will need to access.This concept of bypassing the hard drive to speed up throughput has been around for more than 30 years now.  During the early 1980s, Microsoft and other software vendors offered a ""VDISK"" application that could allocate a block of RAM memory for use as a virtual disk drive.  The operating system would then just treat this virtual disk drive as if it was another hard drive, albeit an extremely fast hard drive.  So even with the Microsoft MS-DOS 2.0 operating system than ran on the original IBM PC (which is prehistoric stone age compared to Windows and OS X :-) , you could read and write data to a device that was 50 to 70 times faster than a 7200-RPM hard drive and 15 to 20 times faster than an SSD drive.  The main disadvantage with the original ""VDISK"" applications was that if the computer lost power or was turned off, all the RAM disk contents would instantly disappear.  While RAM disk functionality is no longer in Windows, RAM disk software is still offered by some software companies, it can still provide a speed boost when combined with either regular hard drives or SSD drives, and the modern RAM disk software can write the RAM contents as a disk image on the hard drive, either at regular intervals or during shutdown, to prevent accidental data loss if your computer suddenly loses power.  If your computer has plenty of memory that remains unused by applications, you can allocate some of that free memory to a RAM disk to speed up disk-intensive activities such as HD video editing, databases, and compilation of source code during software development.  A company called Dataram makes an excellent ""RAMDisk"" software.  Their freeware version lets you create a RAM disk up to 4 GB in size, while their commercial version lets you create a virtual disk that is larger than 4 GB.If your computer has a conventional hard drive along with either an SSD drive or mSATA SSD card, Intel has two software applications that can considerably speed up how fast the computer wakes up from hibernation mode and can speed up hard disk performance by smart-caching recently and frequently used files.  Intel's ""Rapid Start Technology"" can be used to allocate a hidden partition on an SSD drive to write out the entire contents of system memory when the computer goes into hibernation mode.  When the computer wakes up from hibernation mode, it can be ready to use far quicker than if hibernation mode had written the contents of 16 GB of system memory to a regular hard drive.  Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" software lets the user configure a part of an SSD to be used as a smart cache, so the SSD's fast-cache partition sits in between system memory and the regular hard drive to provide SSD-like performance.  And unlike RAM disk software, this SRT does not require a separate drive letter identifier and there is no extra latency in having to save the RAM contents as a disk image since SSD drives use non-volatile NAND flash memory.This Seagate hybrid solid state hard drive uses the same smart-caching approach as combining Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" with both a regular hard drive and a SSD drive.  The critical performance-altering difference, however, is that this Seagate drive only has an 8-GB SSD cache, whereas with Intel's SRT, you can configure it to allocate more caching space on the SSD, which helps in situations where you often work with large files.This SSHD is the successor to Seagate's previous second-generation Momentus XT hybrid hard drives, which also use flash memory caching, and Seagate advertises that this drive ""boots and performs like an SSD"".  Seagate created the industry's first solid state hybrid hard drive in 2007 with their Momentus PSD.  But their Momentus PSD only used 128 MB or 256 MB of onboard NAND flash caching, which was too small to create much of a speed boost.  Their initial release of Momentus XT SSHDs substantially increased the NAND flash cache to 4 GB, which was further increased to 8 GB on their last versions of Momentus XT drives.  But some of Seagate's previous Momentus XT hybrid drive models combined a 7200-RPM drive with the 8-GB of flash memory, whereas this third-generation SSHD spins at a slower 5400-RPM speed.  Both with Seagate's previous 7200-RPM Momentus XT drives and this drive, I saw about a 20% to 30% speed boost when cold-booting my Windows 7 PC from a previous full shutdown.  During the first few shutdowns after initially installing this drive as the system/boot drive, the boot times were not quicker, but then it seems that this hybrid drive's firmware ""learned"" which system files to cache for noticeably faster booting.  But I saw only a slightly quicker response when going into and coming out of hibernation mode.  This hard drive's SSD smart-caching cannot speed up the time that it takes to come out of hibernation mode because the computer's entire memory contents must be written to disk during hibernation and this hard drive's smart-caching logic cannot adapt to the memory dump onto a disk image during hibernation; for this to work, the computer would need to have less than 8-GB of memory to write its memory contents into the 8-GB of SSHD cache anyway.  Depending upon what software applications I am running, the smart-caching may or may not offer a noticeable performance boost.The 9.5mm size of the 1-TB internal drive will fit most laptops.  Some SSD drives have a 7.0mm size that may not fit the drive bracket or connector of some laptops.  Note that the 1-TB version of this SSHD hard drive, with a model number of ""ST1000LM014"", has a 9.5mm thickness, while the 500-GB version, with a model number of ""ST500LM000"", is a thinner 7.0mm size.  So the 9.5mm-thick 1-TB drive may be a better size fit for your laptop, while the 7.0mm-thick 500-GB drive may be a better fit for an ultrabook or thin laptop.  Some laptops and devices, such as Sony PlayStations, can use either a 9.5mm or 7.0mm hard drive.While some Seagate drives include a ""Quick Start Guide"", this drive does not include any guide manual.  If you have installed an internal laptop drive before, this drive easily installs without issues or the need to install any special drivers.  Depending upon where you are going to install this internal hard drive, you may need a small No.1 Phillips screwdriver, a T6 Torx screwdriver (for a MacBook), or other screwdriver.  If you work on computer hardware, it is always handy to have No. 1, 0, 00, and 000 screwdrivers in your electronics toolbox.When tested using the ""HD Tune"" hard drive performance benchmarking tool, I get a minimum/maximum/average sequential read speed of 46/116/85 MB/s and an average sequential write speed of 81 MB/s.  These are pretty good speeds for a 5400-RPM internal laptop drive, but there is obviously no sign that the 8-GB of flash memory is working here during the sequential read test.  An SSD drive can exceed 400 MB/s on sequential reads.  However, in random read access, I measured as high as 146 MB/s on 1-MB random reads.  Although this is still far slower than an SSD drive, and Seagate Barracuda, Western Digital VelociRaptor, and Hitachi Deskstar drives are faster, this is as fast as many 7200-RPM laptop drives.  These test results do show that this Seagate SSHD is better at random read/writes, whereas you get less performance and less use of its 8-GB SSD cache if you are frequently performing sequential reads/writes of large video/movie/multimedia files.  During initial reads of files, this hard drive performs just like an average 5400-RPM drive.  The SSHD does not read from the 8-GB SSD cache unless you are repeatedly accessing the same files.If you are already using 7200-RPM drives, this is not a faster upgrade.  This drive could have been faster than regular 7200-RPM drives if it also used a 7200-RPM drive like Seagate's previous Momentus XT hybrid drives, instead of using a 5400-RPM drive.  But if your laptop has regular 5400-RPM drives, this makes a great upgrade.  Just don't expect SSD-level performance :-)  If you can afford to buy a SSD drive for use as the system/boot drive, that is the fastest and best option.  A dedicated SSD drive is also the best option if you need to edit very large HD videos since the speed-up due to the SSD smart-caching of this Seagate hybrid drive is much better suited for smaller system files, application files, and smaller data files that are frequently used.  The 8-GB of flash caching is too small for users who frequently hop around reading and writing large multimedia files.  Earlier this year, X-Bit Labs reported that Seagate will stop production of 7200-RPM laptop hard drives by the end of 2013 to focus just on these SSHD drives along with 5400-RPM drives for the laptop market.  Other companies such as Western Digital and Hitachi continue to offer 7200-RPM laptop drives.  Part of Seagate's marketing decision may also be due to the price of SSD drives steadily becoming lower and lower; i.e. Seagate is assuming that customers will either spend more for the faster SSD drives or spend less for these enhanced 5400-RPM SSHD drives.  But I would have preferred that Seagate stop production of 5400-RPM drives to focus on 7200-RPM SSHD drives.  Unless these 5400-RPM SSHD drives have their price lowered, the 7200-RPM conventional 2.5-inch hard drives from Western Digital and Hitachi currently offer performance that is just as good as this Seagate SSHD at prices that are 25% to 40% cheaper.While this drive is better than a regular 5400-RPM drive, it is less competitive than other 1-TB 7200-RPM internal laptop drives both in terms of pricing and performance.  Both the sequential and random access performance could have been improved if this drive included a larger SSD cache than 8 GB.  At a minimum, the hard drive really needs at least 24 GB or 32 GB of SSD caching built into this drive.  I have a 16-GB laptop that uses Intel's ""Rapid Start Technology"" combined with a 32-GB mSATA SSD card and two 1-TB 5400-RPM hard drives, and it only takes three or four seconds to fully wake up from hibernation mode, reading the 16-GB system memory image that was written to the mSATA SSD card and loading it back into system memory.  Using this Seagate SSHD as my system/boot drive on another laptop, it still takes quite a bit longer to become fully operational when waking up from hibernation mode.  On one of my laptops that is equipped with two 1-TB 5400-RPM conventional hard drives and the 32-GB mSATA SSD card, when I edit large photo/graphics/video files, sometimes repeatedly opening and closing numerous files throughout the week, those files often get cached onto the 32-GB mSATA SSD card by Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" software that is installed on this laptop.  And then when I reopen a large 11-GB HD video file to edit it again on the following day, I am pleasantly surprised and reminded of the SSD caching because the HD video file gets loaded extremely fast by the application into memory.  If I hop back and forth editing photos and videos on another laptop where I have installed this Seagate SSHD as my system/boot drive, this caching rarely happens on the SSHD's 8-GB SSD cache.Even though it uses a 5400-RPM hard drive, this Seagate SSHD uses more power than most 5400-RPM hard drives.  This Seagate SSHD drive uses 0.9 watts of power while it is idling and 2.7 watts while reading/writing.  By comparison, some of the latest 5400-RPM hard drives in 500-GB and 1-TB sizes use about 0.6 to 0.7 watts while idling and 1.4 to 1.7 watts while reading/writing.  So perhaps the SSD caching and the need for the smart-caching firmware to constantly track whether data can be read from the SSD or has to be retrieved from the hard disk adds an additional 1-watt of power usage overhead during reads/writes compared to a regular 5400-RPM drive.  With respect to how hot it runs, its heat feels more like a 5400-RPM drive than a 7200-RPM drive; i.e. staying fair cool under moderate usage and getting warm under heavy usage.  But this SSHD drive uses almost as much energy as some regular 7200-RPM hard drives, or about 40% to 80% more energy than some of the better energy-efficient 5400-RPM laptop hard drives on the market.  With this SSHD installed in my laptop, I noticed that its battery life was reduced compared to the previous 5400-RPM hard drive that it replaced; usually I get at least 6 hours of battery power and now I get between 4 and 5 hours running on battery.  Because of this, I ended up moving this Seagate SSHD from my laptop to my PlayStation where it serves as a far better performance and disk space upgrade.This Seagate SSHD is currently priced on Amazon about 25% to 40% more than a regular 1-TB 5400-RPM or 7200-RPM hard drive.  Some great 1-TB drives, at both 5400-RPM and 7200-RPM speeds, are currently priced around $75 to $80 at the time of this review's writing; 5400-RPM runs cooler and lasts longer on battery, while 7200-RPM runs hotter and eats up more battery juice while being about 15% to 20% faster than some of the best 5400-RPM drives.  I really wish that Seagate retained the 7200-RPM design that they used in last year's Momentus XT hybrid drive models.  If this SSHD used a 7200-RPM drive combined with at least 24-GB or 32-GB of SSD caching, Seagate would have a really winning combination, it would justify a higher price of this SSHD drive, and I would then give it an unequivocal 5-star rating, instead of rating it 4 stars.  But with its current design, price, performance, and power usage, it may not be better than using a regular 7200-RPM drive.  The more frequently you access the same files every day, the more you will utilize the built-in SSD cache and realize a performance boost.  The more that you access a variety of large files, reading and writing new files throughout the week (which, for my needs, means HD video editing), the less benefit you will get from the SSD cache and a 7200-RPM drive will provide better performance.So it really depends upon what you are using this SSHD drive for, and what is important to you.  If you want speed and performance while working with large graphics/photo/video/multimedia files, an SSD drive is the best (and most expensive) choice, and a 7200-RPM drive is the second best choice.  7200-RPM drives used to cost more than 5400-RPM drives, but the price difference between most 7200-RPM and 5400-RPM drives has now become negligible.If you are looking for a 1-TB laptop drive that will serve as the system/boot drive of a laptop and you are not using the hard drive to also view or edit lots of graphics/photos/videos, instead just using the drive for office/software/email/Internet work, then this Seagate SSHD is a great choice.  If you replace an existing 5400-RPM system/boot drive with this 5400-RPM SSHD drive, you will notice a livelier faster system response with common computer functions since you would get SSD read speeds while repeatedly accessing the same files and applications.  Studies have shown that the typical office worker reads about 19 GB of data during a 5-day work week, with about half of that data being unique reads and the other half being duplicate reads of the same files.  For example, if you frequently go back and forth between using Microsoft Outlook, Word, and Excel, or if you are a software developer who goes back and forth between editing, debugging, and testing code, you will notice a quicker zippier response from your laptop when using this SSD-caching 5400-RPM drive compared to using a regular 5400-RPM hard drive.  This SSHD is also an excellent upgrade for a PlayStation because PlayStations access the same software and game files quite frequently, thus allowing the drive to frequently read from the SSD cache, resulting in faster start times, load times, and response times.However, if you are a graphic designer or photo/video editing software user, or if you frequently access photo/video/multimedia files or a variety of other large files either for work or entertainment, the 8-GB of NAND flash caching is too small to provide much of a speed boost when compared to a 7200-RPM or SSD drive.  People tend to access a particular multimedia file - such as a JPEG/RAW photo file, HD video, or Adobe graphics file - less frequently than specific application program files and document files.  You may access a multimedia file just once, either to view or edit it, and then not access it again until later on.  In these one-use situations, these multimedia files will not be cached onto the SSD, but will need to be read from the 5400-RPM hard drive, and a 7200-RPM would be faster in reading and writing these large files, both because the files may not be already cached onto the 8-GB SSD and because, even if you repeatedly read in the same set of multimedia files every day, trying to cache numerous large multimedia files could quickly overflow the 8-GB flash cache.  In this case, you should shop for 1-TB 7200-RPM drives, which are currently about $20 to $40 cheaper than this Seagate drive.If speed is less important to you than maximizing the number of hours that you can run on battery power, and SSD drives are out of your budget, some of the most energy-efficient 5400-RPM drives use 30% to 80% less energy than either this SSHD drive or 7200-RPM drives.  SSD drives are the best storage solution for speed, size, weight, energy use and battery life, heat generation, and resistance to both mechanical and thermal damage.  But if you need 512-GB or 1-TB capacity, SSDs are really expensive (for now... ;-)If you do replace your main system drive, you can either use cloning software such as ""Acronis True Image"" to mirror all your system files and applications back onto the new drive, or you can perform a fresh OS install and reinstall all applications that you were using.  Seagate also has a ""DiscWizard"" tool on their Web site that you can download to help guide you with creating and partitioning the drive, and transferring data.  The advantage of cloning your system files and applications is that it is much faster to put everything back onto the new drive.  The advantage of performing fresh installs of the OS and applications is that it can often declutter your files and free up hundreds of megabytes of space (which is like totally cleaning out a basement that has accumulated years of stuff).This drive is rated at a very quiet 22 dBA sound level when idle, and 24 dBA when the drive is seeking/reading/writing.  With the drive installed inside my laptop, I can only barely hear the drive's operation in a quiet room when my ears are about one feet away from the drives' location inside the laptop and the drives are actively reading/writing.  When the laptop is idle, I do not hear the drives at all.  And even if this hard drive is actively seeking/reading/writing, its tiny sound is often masked by my laptop's fan noise with the fan running at its slowest speed.  This product has a 3-year limited warranty, which is good, but not great since some hard drives have a 5-year warranty.  There was a time not too long ago when all hard drives had a 5-year warranty as a de facto standard.Also note that there are currently two versions of this 1-GB SSHD hard drive: the Seagate 1TB Solid State Hybrid Drive SATA 6Gbps 64MB Cache 2.5-Inch ST1000LM014 and the Seagate Superspeed Laptop 1TB SSHD Solid State Hybrid Drive STBD1000400.  The ""STBD1000400"" model, what Seagate refers to as their ""kit"" version, has the standard retail box packaging and includes a warranty booklet.  The ""ST1000LM014"" model has basic bare-drive packaging.  But the hard drive is identical with both of these model numbers.  Despite Seagate's confusing model numbering and advertising that mentions extra parts being included in the STBD1000400, there are no extra hardware parts included in the STBD1000400 kit.  The STBD1000400 kit just has a nicer cardboard box and a printed warranty booklet, and you may discard the box after installing the hard drive anyway; that is the only difference between both model numbers.  I usually interpret a hardware ""kit"" to mean that it also includes mounting screws or some kind of mounting bracket, but the STBD1000400's ""kit"" just means that its box looks better sitting on a store shelf.  If you are considering between both of these models, just get whichever version is cheaper.  At the time of this review's writing, the ""ST1000LM014"" model was about $15 cheaper than the ""STBD1000400"" model; but prices can change day by day on Amazon.  I have seen the ST1000LM014's price range between $95 and $130 on Amazon, while the STBD1000400's price has fluctuated between $115 and $130; again, you get the exact same hard drive in both models.I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions.  I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234UJSMQL172B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B99JUBQ#wasThisHelpful","R234UJSMQL172B","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.Although there were a lot of potential topics that were not adequately covered by this little book (thus the removal of one star), I found the information covered by this husband and wife team to be fairly useful, albeit some of the advice may definitely be construed as everyday common sense.  Some of us may go through life just assuming that we know how to handle all life situations.  And when it comes to love, we may expect that love will just come naturally once we find ""the one"".  But we often do not stop and introspect about what we are actually doing (and not doing) correctly, why we are doing something, and why things do not work out as we had hoped.  The value of this book and accompanying CD is that it takes you through a series of steps and lessons to help you clarify, write down, and consider what you think about yourself and other people, and how you are approaching or avoiding love.The author, salesman, and motivational speaker, Zig Ziglar, published a book in 1975 called ""See You At The Top"" in which he exhorted the reader to eliminate ""stinkin' thinkin'"" and to move from ""mediocrity to meteority.""  The affirmations and meditations that are combined with introspection exercises in this book promote a similar idea of overcoming fears, building self-esteem, visualizing the qualities that you want in a relationship, and eliminating negative stinkin' thinkin'.  The CD that is included with this book is not just an audio version of the book, but it takes you through meditations and affirmations.  I think that any kind of affirmation needs to be repeatedly pounded into your mind and heart until it becomes internalized as a permanent part of your character.  As people often say: ""Talk is cheap.""  But if you keep your words positive through affirmations, they can become part of your stream of consciousness over time, which then become your behaviors, which then form your habits, which then become your inner values, that finally affect your destiny.  Although the messages presented in this book are not tremendously profound, it was a helpful read.  I have found less useful fluff padded inside some self-help books on love that had more than twice the number of pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLALD4F0PMH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145874020X#wasThisHelpful","R3DLALD4F0PMH4","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: This 5400-RPM drive that utilizes 8-GB SSD smart-caching is a great upgrade to replace an existing 5400-RPM or PlayStation drive, as long as you frequently access applications and data files repeatedly. This 5400-RPM drive can perform almost as fast as many 7200-RPM drives, but it still cannot match SSD drive speeds. This drive runs very quietly and can just barely be heard most of the time. The 1-TB drive has a standard 9.5mm size suitable for most laptops, while the 500-GB version of this drive is 7.0mm size and may be a better fit for ultrabooks and thin laptops. This drive has a 3-year limited warranty. Negatives: Unlike some previous Seagate Momentus XT drives that combine flash memory caching with a 7200-RPM drive, this drive spins at 5400-RPM. In order to provide a robust speed boost that improves all usage scenarios, the SSD caching really needs to be increased to at least 24-GB or 32-GB in size, especially if you frequently work with graphics/photo/video/multimedia files. Even though it uses a 5400-RPM hard drive, this Seagate SSHD consumes almost as much energy as some regular 7200-RPM hard drives, or about 40% to 80% more energy than some of the better energy-efficient 5400-RPM mobile hard drives on the market. While this drive does noticeably improve the boot time during a cold boot, the speed-up when waking up from hibernation mode is only slightly quicker. Both with performance and price, this drive may not be better than buying a 1-TB 7200-RPM drive.This solid state hybrid drive combines 8-GB of MLC (Multi-Level Cell) NAND flash memory with a conventional 1-TB 5400-RPM hard drive that has 64-MB of DRAM read/write buffer cache.  The flash memory's firmware provides intelligent smart-caching so that recently or frequently used files are stored in the faster flash memory instead of needing to always access the slower spinning hard drive, and the firmware learns and tries to predict which files you will need to access.This concept of bypassing the hard drive to speed up throughput has been around for more than 30 years now.  During the early 1980s, Microsoft and other software vendors offered a ""VDISK"" application that could allocate a block of RAM memory for use as a virtual disk drive.  The operating system would then just treat this virtual disk drive as if it was another hard drive, albeit an extremely fast hard drive.  So even with the Microsoft MS-DOS 2.0 operating system than ran on the original IBM PC (which is prehistoric stone age compared to Windows and OS X :-) , you could read and write data to a device that was 50 to 70 times faster than a 7200-RPM hard drive and 15 to 20 times faster than an SSD drive.  The main disadvantage with the original ""VDISK"" applications was that if the computer lost power or was turned off, all the RAM disk contents would instantly disappear.  While RAM disk functionality is no longer in Windows, RAM disk software is still offered by some software companies, it can still provide a speed boost when combined with either regular hard drives or SSD drives, and the modern RAM disk software can write the RAM contents as a disk image on the hard drive, either at regular intervals or during shutdown, to prevent accidental data loss if your computer suddenly loses power.  If your computer has plenty of memory that remains unused by applications, you can allocate some of that free memory to a RAM disk to speed up disk-intensive activities such as HD video editing, databases, and compilation of source code during software development.  A company called Dataram makes an excellent ""RAMDisk"" software.  Their freeware version lets you create a RAM disk up to 4 GB in size, while their commercial version lets you create a virtual disk that is larger than 4 GB.If your computer has a conventional hard drive along with either an SSD drive or mSATA SSD card, Intel has two software applications that can considerably speed up how fast the computer wakes up from hibernation mode and can speed up hard disk performance by smart-caching recently and frequently used files.  Intel's ""Rapid Start Technology"" can be used to allocate a hidden partition on an SSD drive to write out the entire contents of system memory when the computer goes into hibernation mode.  When the computer wakes up from hibernation mode, it can be ready to use far quicker than if hibernation mode had written the contents of 16 GB of system memory to a regular hard drive.  Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" software lets the user configure a part of an SSD to be used as a smart cache, so the SSD's fast-cache partition sits in between system memory and the regular hard drive to provide SSD-like performance.  And unlike RAM disk software, this SRT does not require a separate drive letter identifier and there is no extra latency in having to save the RAM contents as a disk image since SSD drives use non-volatile NAND flash memory.This Seagate hybrid solid state hard drive uses the same smart-caching approach as combining Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" with both a regular hard drive and a SSD drive.  The critical performance-altering difference, however, is that this Seagate drive only has an 8-GB SSD cache, whereas with Intel's SRT, you can configure it to allocate more caching space on the SSD, which helps in situations where you often work with large files.This SSHD is the successor to Seagate's previous second-generation Momentus XT hybrid hard drives, which also use flash memory caching, and Seagate advertises that this drive ""boots and performs like an SSD"".  Seagate created the industry's first solid state hybrid hard drive in 2007 with their Momentus PSD.  But their Momentus PSD only used 128 MB or 256 MB of onboard NAND flash caching, which was too small to create much of a speed boost.  Their initial release of Momentus XT SSHDs substantially increased the NAND flash cache to 4 GB, which was further increased to 8 GB on their last versions of Momentus XT drives.  But some of Seagate's previous Momentus XT hybrid drive models combined a 7200-RPM drive with the 8-GB of flash memory, whereas this third-generation SSHD spins at a slower 5400-RPM speed.  Both with Seagate's previous 7200-RPM Momentus XT drives and this drive, I saw about a 20% to 30% speed boost when cold-booting my Windows 7 PC from a previous full shutdown.  During the first few shutdowns after initially installing this drive as the system/boot drive, the boot times were not quicker, but then it seems that this hybrid drive's firmware ""learned"" which system files to cache for noticeably faster booting.  But I saw only a slightly quicker response when going into and coming out of hibernation mode.  This hard drive's SSD smart-caching cannot speed up the time that it takes to come out of hibernation mode because the computer's entire memory contents must be written to disk during hibernation and this hard drive's smart-caching logic cannot adapt to the memory dump onto a disk image during hibernation; for this to work, the computer would need to have less than 8-GB of memory to write its memory contents into the 8-GB of SSHD cache anyway.  Depending upon what software applications I am running, the smart-caching may or may not offer a noticeable performance boost.The 9.5mm size of the 1-TB internal drive will fit most laptops.  Some SSD drives have a 7.0mm size that may not fit the drive bracket or connector of some laptops.  Note that the 1-TB version of this SSHD hard drive, with a model number of ""ST1000LM014"", has a 9.5mm thickness, while the 500-GB version, with a model number of ""ST500LM000"", is a thinner 7.0mm size.  So the 9.5mm-thick 1-TB drive may be a better size fit for your laptop, while the 7.0mm-thick 500-GB drive may be a better fit for an ultrabook or thin laptop.  Some laptops and devices, such as Sony PlayStations, can use either a 9.5mm or 7.0mm hard drive.While some Seagate drives include a ""Quick Start Guide"", this drive does not include any guide manual.  If you have installed an internal laptop drive before, this drive easily installs without issues or the need to install any special drivers.  Depending upon where you are going to install this internal hard drive, you may need a small No.1 Phillips screwdriver, a T6 Torx screwdriver (for a MacBook), or other screwdriver.  If you work on computer hardware, it is always handy to have No. 1, 0, 00, and 000 screwdrivers in your electronics toolbox.When tested using the ""HD Tune"" hard drive performance benchmarking tool, I get a minimum/maximum/average sequential read speed of 46/116/85 MB/s and an average sequential write speed of 81 MB/s.  These are pretty good speeds for a 5400-RPM internal laptop drive, but there is obviously no sign that the 8-GB of flash memory is working here during the sequential read test.  An SSD drive can exceed 400 MB/s on sequential reads.  However, in random read access, I measured as high as 146 MB/s on 1-MB random reads.  Although this is still far slower than an SSD drive, and Seagate Barracuda, Western Digital VelociRaptor, and Hitachi Deskstar drives are faster, this is as fast as many 7200-RPM laptop drives.  These test results do show that this Seagate SSHD is better at random read/writes, whereas you get less performance and less use of its 8-GB SSD cache if you are frequently performing sequential reads/writes of large video/movie/multimedia files.  During initial reads of files, this hard drive performs just like an average 5400-RPM drive.  The SSHD does not read from the 8-GB SSD cache unless you are repeatedly accessing the same files.If you are already using 7200-RPM drives, this is not a faster upgrade.  This drive could have been faster than regular 7200-RPM drives if it also used a 7200-RPM drive like Seagate's previous Momentus XT hybrid drives, instead of using a 5400-RPM drive.  But if your laptop has regular 5400-RPM drives, this makes a great upgrade.  Just don't expect SSD-level performance :-)  If you can afford to buy a SSD drive for use as the system/boot drive, that is the fastest and best option.  A dedicated SSD drive is also the best option if you need to edit very large HD videos since the speed-up due to the SSD smart-caching of this Seagate hybrid drive is much better suited for smaller system files, application files, and smaller data files that are frequently used.  The 8-GB of flash caching is too small for users who frequently hop around reading and writing large multimedia files.  Earlier this year, X-Bit Labs reported that Seagate will stop production of 7200-RPM laptop hard drives by the end of 2013 to focus just on these SSHD drives along with 5400-RPM drives for the laptop market.  Other companies such as Western Digital and Hitachi continue to offer 7200-RPM laptop drives.  Part of Seagate's marketing decision may also be due to the price of SSD drives steadily becoming lower and lower; i.e. Seagate is assuming that customers will either spend more for the faster SSD drives or spend less for these enhanced 5400-RPM SSHD drives.  But I would have preferred that Seagate stop production of 5400-RPM drives to focus on 7200-RPM SSHD drives.  Unless these 5400-RPM SSHD drives have their price lowered, the 7200-RPM conventional 2.5-inch hard drives from Western Digital and Hitachi currently offer performance that is just as good as this Seagate SSHD at prices that are 25% to 40% cheaper.While this drive is better than a regular 5400-RPM drive, it is less competitive than other 1-TB 7200-RPM internal laptop drives both in terms of pricing and performance.  Both the sequential and random access performance could have been improved if this drive included a larger SSD cache than 8 GB.  At a minimum, the hard drive really needs at least 24 GB or 32 GB of SSD caching built into this drive.  I have a 16-GB laptop that uses Intel's ""Rapid Start Technology"" combined with a 32-GB mSATA SSD card and two 1-TB 5400-RPM hard drives, and it only takes three or four seconds to fully wake up from hibernation mode, reading the 16-GB system memory image that was written to the mSATA SSD card and loading it back into system memory.  Using this Seagate SSHD as my system/boot drive on another laptop, it still takes quite a bit longer to become fully operational when waking up from hibernation mode.  On one of my laptops that is equipped with two 1-TB 5400-RPM conventional hard drives and the 32-GB mSATA SSD card, when I edit large photo/graphics/video files, sometimes repeatedly opening and closing numerous files throughout the week, those files often get cached onto the 32-GB mSATA SSD card by Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" software that is installed on this laptop.  And then when I reopen a large 11-GB HD video file to edit it again on the following day, I am pleasantly surprised and reminded of the SSD caching because the HD video file gets loaded extremely fast by the application into memory.  If I hop back and forth editing photos and videos on another laptop where I have installed this Seagate SSHD as my system/boot drive, this caching rarely happens on the SSHD's 8-GB SSD cache.Even though it uses a 5400-RPM hard drive, this Seagate SSHD uses more power than most 5400-RPM hard drives.  This Seagate SSHD drive uses 0.9 watts of power while it is idling and 2.7 watts while reading/writing.  By comparison, some of the latest 5400-RPM hard drives in 500-GB and 1-TB sizes use about 0.6 to 0.7 watts while idling and 1.4 to 1.7 watts while reading/writing.  So perhaps the SSD caching and the need for the smart-caching firmware to constantly track whether data can be read from the SSD or has to be retrieved from the hard disk adds an additional 1-watt of power usage overhead during reads/writes compared to a regular 5400-RPM drive.  With respect to how hot it runs, its heat feels more like a 5400-RPM drive than a 7200-RPM drive; i.e. staying fair cool under moderate usage and getting warm under heavy usage.  But this SSHD drive uses almost as much energy as some regular 7200-RPM hard drives, or about 40% to 80% more energy than some of the better energy-efficient 5400-RPM laptop hard drives on the market.  With this SSHD installed in my laptop, I noticed that its battery life was reduced compared to the previous 5400-RPM hard drive that it replaced; usually I get at least 6 hours of battery power and now I get between 4 and 5 hours running on battery.  Because of this, I ended up moving this Seagate SSHD from my laptop to my PlayStation where it serves as a far better performance and disk space upgrade.This Seagate SSHD is currently priced on Amazon about 25% to 40% more than a regular 1-TB 5400-RPM or 7200-RPM hard drive.  Some great 1-TB drives, at both 5400-RPM and 7200-RPM speeds, are currently priced around $75 to $80 at the time of this review's writing; 5400-RPM runs cooler and lasts longer on battery, while 7200-RPM runs hotter and eats up more battery juice while being about 15% to 20% faster than some of the best 5400-RPM drives.  I really wish that Seagate retained the 7200-RPM design that they used in last year's Momentus XT hybrid drive models.  If this SSHD used a 7200-RPM drive combined with at least 24-GB or 32-GB of SSD caching, Seagate would have a really winning combination, it would justify a higher price of this SSHD drive, and I would then give it an unequivocal 5-star rating, instead of rating it 4 stars.  But with its current design, price, performance, and power usage, it may not be better than using a regular 7200-RPM drive.  The more frequently you access the same files every day, the more you will utilize the built-in SSD cache and realize a performance boost.  The more that you access a variety of large files, reading and writing new files throughout the week (which, for my needs, means HD video editing), the less benefit you will get from the SSD cache and a 7200-RPM drive will provide better performance.So it really depends upon what you are using this SSHD drive for, and what is important to you.  If you want speed and performance while working with large graphics/photo/video/multimedia files, an SSD drive is the best (and most expensive) choice, and a 7200-RPM drive is the second best choice.  7200-RPM drives used to cost more than 5400-RPM drives, but the price difference between most 7200-RPM and 5400-RPM drives has now become negligible.If you are looking for a 1-TB laptop drive that will serve as the system/boot drive of a laptop and you are not using the hard drive to also view or edit lots of graphics/photos/videos, instead just using the drive for office/software/email/Internet work, then this Seagate SSHD is a great choice.  If you replace an existing 5400-RPM system/boot drive with this 5400-RPM SSHD drive, you will notice a livelier faster system response with common computer functions since you would get SSD read speeds while repeatedly accessing the same files and applications.  Studies have shown that the typical office worker reads about 19 GB of data during a 5-day work week, with about half of that data being unique reads and the other half being duplicate reads of the same files.  For example, if you frequently go back and forth between using Microsoft Outlook, Word, and Excel, or if you are a software developer who goes back and forth between editing, debugging, and testing code, you will notice a quicker zippier response from your laptop when using this SSD-caching 5400-RPM drive compared to using a regular 5400-RPM hard drive.  This SSHD is also an excellent upgrade for a PlayStation because PlayStations access the same software and game files quite frequently, thus allowing the drive to frequently read from the SSD cache, resulting in faster start times, load times, and response times.However, if you are a graphic designer or photo/video editing software user, or if you frequently access photo/video/multimedia files or a variety of other large files either for work or entertainment, the 8-GB of NAND flash caching is too small to provide much of a speed boost when compared to a 7200-RPM or SSD drive.  People tend to access a particular multimedia file - such as a JPEG/RAW photo file, HD video, or Adobe graphics file - less frequently than specific application program files and document files.  You may access a multimedia file just once, either to view or edit it, and then not access it again until later on.  In these one-use situations, these multimedia files will not be cached onto the SSD, but will need to be read from the 5400-RPM hard drive, and a 7200-RPM would be faster in reading and writing these large files, both because the files may not be already cached onto the 8-GB SSD and because, even if you repeatedly read in the same set of multimedia files every day, trying to cache numerous large multimedia files could quickly overflow the 8-GB flash cache.  In this case, you should shop for 1-TB 7200-RPM drives, which are currently about $20 to $40 cheaper than this Seagate drive.If speed is less important to you than maximizing the number of hours that you can run on battery power, and SSD drives are out of your budget, some of the most energy-efficient 5400-RPM drives use 30% to 80% less energy than either this SSHD drive or 7200-RPM drives.  SSD drives are the best storage solution for speed, size, weight, energy use and battery life, heat generation, and resistance to both mechanical and thermal damage.  But if you need 512-GB or 1-TB capacity, SSDs are really expensive (for now... ;-)If you do replace your main system drive, you can either use cloning software such as ""Acronis True Image"" to mirror all your system files and applications back onto the new drive, or you can perform a fresh OS install and reinstall all applications that you were using.  Seagate also has a ""DiscWizard"" tool on their Web site that you can download to help guide you with creating and partitioning the drive, and transferring data.  The advantage of cloning your system files and applications is that it is much faster to put everything back onto the new drive.  The advantage of performing fresh installs of the OS and applications is that it can often declutter your files and free up hundreds of megabytes of space (which is like totally cleaning out a basement that has accumulated years of stuff).This drive is rated at a very quiet 22 dBA sound level when idle, and 24 dBA when the drive is seeking/reading/writing.  With the drive installed inside my laptop, I can only barely hear the drive's operation in a quiet room when my ears are about one feet away from the drives' location inside the laptop and the drives are actively reading/writing.  When the laptop is idle, I do not hear the drives at all.  And even if this hard drive is actively seeking/reading/writing, its tiny sound is often masked by my laptop's fan noise with the fan running at its slowest speed.  This product has a 3-year limited warranty, which is good, but not great since some hard drives have a 5-year warranty.  There was a time not too long ago when all hard drives had a 5-year warranty as a de facto standard.Also note that there are currently two versions of this 1-GB SSHD hard drive: the Seagate 1TB Solid State Hybrid Drive SATA 6Gbps 64MB Cache 2.5-Inch ST1000LM014 and the Seagate Superspeed Laptop 1TB SSHD Solid State Hybrid Drive STBD1000400.  The ""STBD1000400"" model, what Seagate refers to as their ""kit"" version, has the standard retail box packaging and includes a warranty booklet.  The ""ST1000LM014"" model has basic bare-drive packaging.  But the hard drive is identical with both of these model numbers.  Despite Seagate's confusing model numbering and advertising that mentions extra parts being included in the STBD1000400, there are no extra hardware parts included in the STBD1000400 kit.  The STBD1000400 kit just has a nicer cardboard box and a printed warranty booklet, and you may discard the box after installing the hard drive anyway; that is the only difference between both model numbers.  I usually interpret a hardware ""kit"" to mean that it also includes mounting screws or some kind of mounting bracket, but the STBD1000400's ""kit"" just means that its box looks better sitting on a store shelf.  If you are considering between both of these models, just get whichever version is cheaper.  At the time of this review's writing, the ""ST1000LM014"" model was about $15 cheaper than the ""STBD1000400"" model; but prices can change day by day on Amazon.  I have seen the ST1000LM014's price range between $95 and $130 on Amazon, while the STBD1000400's price has fluctuated between $115 and $130; again, you get the exact same hard drive in both models.I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions.  I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGI9TYRHIO1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSH3CCC#wasThisHelpful","RQGI9TYRHIO1R","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"   Rating: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!This L-Carnosine is like the maid working at the hotel that is your body.  Its antioxidant functions can go through your body's cells and organs and vacuum up the superoxide free radicals and reactive oxygen species debris that were left by your body's various oxidative processes that constantly occur as normal cellular processes.  It is related to the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine; in other words, it is a protein building block.  It is mainly found in the brain, heart, and muscles, especially in the muscles of physically active people, although it is also present in the skin and digestive system.  Along with helping your body to age slower by increasing the replicative lifespan of the cells in some of your organs, it also neutralizes, prevents, or inhibits the deleterious side effects of many other biochemical by-products that are the result of your body's daily cell functions along with abnormalities caused by accidental malfunctioning of your body.  It has a large variety of benefits related to improving cell health and promoting healthy aging.  It can inhibit the glycosylation of proteins, which has been linked to aging of skin, brain, and eyes.  Studies have shown that it can prevent or slow the growth of senile cataracts in older people.  Some animal studies have shown it to slow the growth of cancers.  It also helps to protect your stomach, kidneys, and liver.  Some studies have shown that carnosine helps to protect the liver from oxidative stress and damage due to the consumption of alcohol.  Hmmm... I could have really used this supplement during my freshman year in college!  ;-)The ""Hayflick Limit"", named after the person who discovered it in 1961, Leonard Hayflick, states that most cells can only divide for a limited number of repetitions, often between 40 and 60 divisions, before they reach a state of aged senescence, no longer divide into multiple cells, and the cell eventually dies.  Studies have shown that carnosine can increase the number of times a cell can replicate itself by 20 to 25 percent, and also triple the lifespan of each cell.Each capsule of this supplement contains 500 mg of L-Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine).  The usage instructions for this Jarrow supplement say to take ""1 capsule 1 to 3 times per day with juice or water on an empty stomach"".  Since I tend to practice moderation with supplements and I do not subscribe to a mega-vitamin mega-dosage approach, since mega-doses can place too much stress on your liver and kidneys, I would suggest taking just one of these carnosine capsules per day instead of three.  Because this supplement increases the replicative lifespan of cells, allowing cells to divide into more cells for a longer period of time, there have been suggestions that carnosine could promote the growth of some cancers (even though it prevents the growth of other cancers) just as taking Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can increase the risk of getting some kinds of cancers.  Taking one capsule per day gives me a 3-month supply with each 90-capsule bottle.  The 500-mg of carnosine in a single capsule is a good daily quantity for most people.  But if I was elderly in age, I would then take one capsule in the morning and one in the evening.  The capsules used in this Jarrow supplement are made of gelatin, which is derived from collagen obtained from various animal by-products, so people who are pure vegans should not take this supplement.I trust the Jarrow brand of supplements because their products are manufactured in GMP-certified facilities located in Santa Fe Springs, CA.  I do not mind buying electronics and other non-food products that are made in China.  But for things such as human food, pet food, vitamins and supplements, and things that I may eat, drink, breathe, or may be absorbed by my skin, I actively try to avoid products that are made in China.  Avoiding China-made vitamins and supplements can be difficult since, for instance, China supplies more than 80% of the vitamin C that is sold in the U.S. or blended into multi-vitamins.  So it is great that Jarrow makes their products in California.Despite this L-Carnosine's wide variety of benefits, this is one of those supplements where you will likely not notice any improvements to your health after taking it for a few weeks just because its benefits happen at such a subtle molecular level.  In fact, if anyone told me that they feel really great after taking this supplement for a few weeks, I would attribute it to a mental placebo effect in that they are convincing themselves that this supplement is doing great things inside their body and thus they feel great because of that.  So after taking this supplement for two months, while I cannot say that my health has markedly improved, I also did not experience any bad side effects from it.  Each capsule is about the size of a large oval vitamin.  If you frequently have problems swallowing larger pills, you can still wash this down your throat by drinking a lot of water after swallowing.Even if you live a very fit lifestyle, eat healthy meals, and exercise frequently, the daily cellular functions inside the hotel that is your body can still result in heavy metal rock bands checking into your body's hotel rooms.  One of these heavy metal rock bands that frequently uses your body's hotel rooms is called ""Free Radical!"" and another heavy metal band is called ""Reactive Oxygen Species"".  These rock bands, along with their adoring groupies, can repeatedly mess up your body's hotel rooms by partying through the night, setting guitars on fire, leaving strange stains on the bedsheets and drapes, dropping pizza slices all over the carpet, and making your hotel rooms look damaged and old.  Carnosine is like the dutiful maid who cringes at the sight of the mess that was left behind, takes a deep breath, and then proceeds to vacuum, wash, and clean out your body's hotel rooms.  And if you take both carnosine and astaxanthin, which is another great supplement to slow down the aging process, then you have two maids who help to clean out the debris left by the ""Free Radical!"" and ""Reactive Oxygen Species"" rock bands in your body's hotel rooms.I hope that my review helps you to make an informed decision about this supplement. If you have a question, please ask in the 'Comment' section of this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171JSVXXQET0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001VKMUG#wasThisHelpful","R171JSVXXQET0Z","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!Prior to this purchase, I bought a BlueRigger 3.5mm audio cable from Amazon last year.  Even though most 3.5mm audio cables are pretty basic and flimsy, I was highly impressed by the build quality of the BlueRigger audio cable.  The same excellent build quality is also in this HDMI-to-DVI-D-dual-link cable.  The thickness and shielding of this cable is very good, and the gold-plated connectors are solidly built.  The cable sheath has the following words printed on it: ""High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet E252840 AWM STYLE 20276 20276 80c 30V VW-1 BlueRigger"".  I am using this cable on laptops connected to a 1920x1200 24"" IPS monitor and a 2560x1440 27"" IPS monitor.  This cable will work with all 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 display monitors.Even though nearly all HDMI-to-DVI and HDMI-to-HDMI cables only advertise themselves as supporting a maximum resolution of 1920x1200, most of these cables will work with a 2560x1440 display resolution.  This BlueRigger cable also works with a 2560x1440 display.  You will likely need to add a custom resolution since most graphics cards do not officially support resolutions higher than 1920x1200 via the HDMI port.  If your graphics card is Intel HD Graphics (3000 or 4000), open up the ""Intel Graphics and Media Control Panel"" and click 'Custom Resolutions'.  Try setting a 'Refresh Rate' of ""60 Hz"" and a 'Timing Standard' of ""CVT-RB"" (Coordinated Video Timings - Reduced Blank).  If you get an error saying that the bandwidth is too low for the settings, try lowering the 'Refresh rate in 5-Hz increments.  If a 60 Hz refresh rate does not work or produces image distortion or flickering, a 55 Hz or 50 Hz refresh rate should work in most setups, but you may have to go as low as 40 Hz or 35 Hz refresh rate, depending upon your hardware setup.  If your video card is Nvidia, open up the Nvidia control panel, try setting 'Refresh Rate' to ""60 Hz"" and 'Scan type' to ""Progressive"".  Expand the 'Timing' menu, set the 'Standard:' timing to ""CVT reduced blank"", and then click the [Test] button.  Again, if you get image distortion or flickering, lower the refresh rate.  After creating the custom resolution, you can select the 2560x1440 entry from the Nvidia Control Panel under 'Change Resolution'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YPEJZ6MJ71K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S4R5CK#wasThisHelpful","R14YPEJZ6MJ71K","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: Unlike some timers that limit the number of hours they can count down from, this timer can count down from 99 hours, 99 minutes, and 99 seconds. Unlike some timers that use two buttons to slowly increment/decrement the time settings, this timer can be easily and quickly programmed by pushing eight buttons in a matter of seconds. The timer can also be used as a stopwatch to count up, instead of down, although the stopwatch still increments in seconds and not milliseconds. The rear of the timer allows for three ways to mount it, either using the magnet, hanging it from its hanging hole in the rear, or using its stand to prop it up. The rear stand also has a double function as a clip to hold small papers or cards. This timer comes with a 1-year warranty, which is good for an inexpensive product like this. Negatives: I wish that this timer also included a regular clock. The rear magnet needs to be stronger to prevent it from detaching from a refrigerator if you press the buttons too hard. The LCD display needs an on/off button to turn off the display, both to preserve battery life and to prevent LCD screen burn-in of the ""00:00 00"" digits.This timer is very handy for a variety of uses: kitchen, office or workplace, hobbies, afternoon nap timer, overnight alarm clock, and timing durations using the stopwatch function.  It is more flexible than some timers that either cannot count down up to 99 hours, 99 minutes, and 99 seconds (over 4 days in duration) or have to be programmed by pushing two buttons to increment/decrement the time settings.  To program the timer, you always just press eight buttons, which can be accomplished in just a few seconds.  Many other digital timers require you to tediously press-and-hold two buttons to increase/decrease the hours, minutes, seconds.Do you need to count down 45 minutes of wait time for something in the kitchen?  Press the [Stop/Reset] button to zero the display, followed by 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, and then the [Start] button to start the timer.  45 minutes later, the timer beeps with a fairly loud shrill sound that can be heard throughout the house.  You can press any button (not just Stop/Reset) to turn off the beeping.  If you do not manually stop the alarm, the beeping stops after one minute.Do you want to take a 30-minute nap?  Press Stop/Reset, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, Start.Do you want to use this timer as an alarm clock overnight after sleeping 8 hours?  Press Stop/Reset, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, Start.  Eight hours later, when you wake up and press any button to turn off the beeping, there is no snooze function, so you either have to get out of bed, or if you want to snooze for ten more minutes, you need to wake up enough to reach over and press Stop/Reset, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, Start.  Just make sure that you do not drowsily push 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 instead and end up snoozing for one hour instead of ten minutes :-)How about using this timer as a stopwatch?  Press Stop/Reset and then Start to start the stopwatch.  To pause the stopwatch, press Stop/Reset once.  To resume the stopwatch, press Start.  To clear the stopwatch, press Stop/Reset once to pause and a second time to reset the display back to ""00:00 00"".There is no on/off button and the LCD display always remains on.  To increase the lifespan of the single AAA battery that this timer uses (and a battery is included with this timer), it needs to have an on/off switch.  Just as important, being able to turn off the LCD display prevents screen burn-in.  Over time, the ""00:00 00"" image may be etched into the LCD screen, reducing the display's clarity and legibility.  Some timer/stopwatch devices also have a regular clock function, and this West Bend timer cannot display the a clock time.  If the LCD display always has to stay on, it can at least just always display the clock time when it is not being used as a timer or stopwatch.  And if this timer's display could be used as a clock, you would not even need to program the timer if you just wanted to watch the clock increment the seconds and minutes on its display.The rear of this timer provides three ways to mount it.  You can either open up the spring-loaded stand to set it on a counter or table, use the rear hanging hole to hang it from a small nail or string, or attach the rear magnet to a metal appliance or surface.  The magnet is not that strong so if you have this timer attached to a refrigerator and press too hard on the buttons, you can knock the timer off and have it drop onto the kitchen floor, possibly damaging it.  It is possible to lightly press the timer's buttons without causing the timer to detach from its magnetic hold, but the safest way is to always hold the timer in your hand whenever you press its buttons to program it or stop its beeping.  Many brands of small timers like this also use a weak magnet, so this is a common problem amongst digital timers.This timer comes with a 1-year warranty, so keep your receipt as proof of purchase if the timer malfunctions.  But I imagine that the warranty does not cover damage due to the timer dropping onto the floor.Overall, this is a great little timer.  I would have rated it 5 stars if it also included a clock function, which many other timers also have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U62H8KHSWKRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JA1JE#wasThisHelpful","R3U62H8KHSWKRM","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies. (I actually rate this 3.5 stars instead of a full 4.0 stars) Packaging, Style, Appearance:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Construction & Build Quality:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Ergonomics & Comfort:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Sound Quality:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Competitive Pricing & Value:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Positives: Along with being used as regular wired headphones, these headphones can connect wirelessly either by pairing to a Bluetooth device or by touching to an NFC-compatible smartphone. These headphones are light in weight and extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods. These are one of the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones that I have ever worn on my larger-than-average head. Even though a headphones' appearance should not matter, these Sony headphones look as good and stylish as some of the other trendier hip headphone brands on the market. It feels quite liberating to not have my ears tethered to regular wired headphones or earbuds. Operating a smartphone while wearing these headphones works well. Negatives: These premium-priced headphones are mostly made of plastic parts. The bass response is overemphasized and slightly muddy. There is not enough higher-frequency treble to add crispness and sparkle to the sound and to balance the heavy bass response; the lack of treble can really dull the sound. A 90-day labor warranty is too stingy for $400 headphones.What is in the box package? Sony MDR-1RBT Bluetooth headphones 20-inch USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable 5-foot 3.5mm audio cable for plugging the headphones into a regular mini-jack ""Quick Start Guide"" foldout sheet ""Reference Guide"" foldout sheet Nylon drawstring carrying pouch with soft interior liningDuring the 1980s and 1990s, long before Bose came on the headphones scene, and even longer before Dr. Dre Beats became a hip fashion statement, Sony, Audio-Technica, and Sennheiser were making some amazing high-end headphones.  While Audio-Technica and Sennheiser have continued offering great headphones across the entire price range, it seems that during the past ten to twenty years, Sony has focused more of their headphones product line on less expensive headphones and earbuds, perhaps to cater more to the iPod/MP3 generation instead of to audiophiles who are listening at home with their headphones plugged into stereo equipment.  These Sony MDR-1RBT Bluetooth headphones are a premium product: premium in design and features, and definitely premium in pricing.These headphones are packaged inside a softly-lined black box that looks more like a gift box, as if you were opening up a fancy box containing jewelry.  Inside the box are the headphones, a 20-inch USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable to charge up the headphones when used in wireless Bluetooth mode, a 5-foot 3.5mm audio cable for connecting the headphones as regular wired headphones, and two foldout guide sheets.  The drawstring carrying pouch is lined with a soft fabric and has a smaller pocket inside it that is useful for carrying the two cables and two foldout guide sheets that come with the headphones.These over-the-ear headphones are very comfortable to wear, with the surrounding cushions feeling very soft and sumptuous.  These are definitely one of the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones that I have ever worn!  My head is larger than average (e.g. most bicycle helmets are too small for me), and some headphones clamp on my head too tightly, but I can wear these headphones for several hours in total comfort.  Because they totally surround your ears with a soft pleather-like cushion, they can feel more warm to wear for an extended period compared to on-the-ear headphones, especially if you wear them outside or wear them while moving around, due to the heat from your body that gets trapped inside the ear-cups.Weighing 10.5 ounces, these headphones feel relatively light.  However, this light weight is achieved by mainly using plastic parts in this headphones' construction.  The headband uses a band of metal, but most of the parts are made of plastic, including some shiny plastic parts that are colored to look like metal.  The ear-cups are connected to plastic hinges, which does not give the impression of long-term durability.  With all the plastic used in its construction, the build quality of this MDR-1RBT feels cheap.  For $400 premium-priced headphones, I would expect more lightweight aluminum, magnesium, or titanium metals being used in the headphones' construction, even if that added a bit more weight to the overall design, for better long-term durability.  And for premium-priced headphones using not-so-premium build quality, these headphones only have a short 90-day labor warranty, although the parts warranty is for 1 year.  Sony should have at least included an all-inclusive labor-and-parts 1 year warranty for these headphones.The plastic rims of both ear-cups contain various controls and input jacks.  The left ear-cup has the power button for using the headphones wirelessly, the Micro-USB port for plugging in the recharging cable to recharge the internal non-user-replaceable lithium ion battery for wireless use, a ""Reset"" button for resetting the Bluetooth connection, the audio input jack for the 3.5mm audio cable for wired use, a microphone opening for phone use, and a red/blue indicator light to show the power or communication status of the headphones.  The right ear-cup has +/- volume buttons, an NFC on/off slider witch to enable/disable the NFC one-touch connection, a forward/reverse/play/pause jog switch for music functions, a phone button to control call functions, and there is an ""N"" NFC logo on the right ear-cup where you touch a smartphone to active the NFC connection.  Once you get used to the location of the controls, they have pretty good ergonomics and are easy to locate while you wear the headphones.  The most-frequently used controls are located on the right side.  If you are left-handed and prefer to operate most of the controls with your left hand, you can wear the headphones with the right channel on your left ear and the headphones fit just as well.There are three ways to connect these headphones to an audio source: (1) Use the included 5-foot 3.5mm audio cable to connect the headphones like regular wired headphones; (2) Pair and wirelessly connect the headphones to a Bluetooth device; and (3) Touch and wirelessly connect the headphones to an iOS or Android smartphone using NFC (Near Field Communication).  If your Android phone can connect via NFC, you need to download Sony's ""NFC Easy Connect"" app in order to use this feature.  If your phone is housed inside a thicker carrying case, that can impede the NFC detection when you touch the phone to the right ear-cup.  But pairing these headphones to a Bluetooth-connected smartphone or device is just as easy and you can wirelessly connect to more devices using Bluetooth, so I tend to mainly use the Bluetooth connection more.  The Bluetooth connection was always reliable and consistent.  As with most Bluetooth devices, these headphones have a line-of-sight Bluetooth range of about 30 feet.  Walls, floors, and other obstacles will reduce the range at which these headphones can be separated from the Bluetooth device.  Using the included 20-inch USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable, it takes about 6 hours to fully charge up the headphones' internal lithium ion battery for wireless use.  Once it is charged up, you get up to 30 hours of music and phone usage time out of the headphones.Sony advertises that these headphones have a ""frequency response"" of 4 Hz to 80 kHz.  The specifications for many audio/stereo components typically list ""frequency response"" as a +/-3 dB range; i.e. the range of frequencies that the headphones or loudspeakers can play back within a +/-3 dB variation of accuracy.  Most humans can hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, although some people can detect down to 15 Hz and up to 25 kHz.  So for Sony to publish a ""frequency response"" for these headphones of 4 Hz to 80 kHz"" is absurd because (1) playing frequencies higher than 30 kHz is pretty useless unless you are buying these headphones for a bat, or for your pet dog, cat, or hamster, who can hear the ultra-high frequencies far better than humans, and (2) more importantly, the 40mm drivers used in these headphones cannot accurately reproduce either a very low earthquake-shaking 4 Hz frequency or an extremely high 80kHz frequency.  In fact, most high-quality headphones can play a tiny smidgen of an actual 4 Hz or 80 kHz sound, but the sound volume of the 4 Hz extremely-low-bass frequency will be much lower than bass frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz.A far more indicative audio specification for these headphones is Sony's listing of these headphones' ""effective frequency range"" of 100 Hz to 4000 Hz.  The ""effective frequency range"" typically denotes the frequency range beyond which, in this case, frequencies lower than 100 Hz and higher than 4000 Hz taper off to less than 10 dB.  The midrange frequencies that encompass most vocals go out to about 5000 Hz, although the range between 2500 Hz and 5000 Hz is sometimes referred to as ""low treble"".  The higher treble frequencies add crispness and clarity to vocals since vocal content often goes out to 7000 or 8000 Hz, and treble frequencies also give cymbals and stringed instruments their sparkle, and give electric guitars their sizzle.  The bass-heavy sound of these headphones give me an impression of being a bit muddy.  This may also be due to the headphones' emphasis on bass and midrange frequencies and not enough high frequencies to provide a more balanced sound.  The midrange frequencies of these headphones sound smooth and warm, and all percussion sounds have a strong punchy feel to them, but the treble sounds more muted.These headphones are best suited for electronic music, dance music, rap, hip-hop, and modern pop music.  Talk radio and the voice of late-night jazz DJs also sound warm and full.  However, because the high-frequency treble is lacking, I would not recommend these headphones if you mainly listen to classical music.  Since I listen to a very wide variety of music, I do not like these headphones as much for classical music and jazz, and rock music does not sound as good because the electric guitars, vocals, and cymbals do not sound as crisp.  Acoustic guitars, violins, and harps lack sparkle in their upper timbres.  So these headphones do not have a bright high-frequency sizzle to their sound, which may or may not be to your liking.  Some headphones can sound too strident during extended listening due to the overemphasis of high frequencies, and with the subdued underemphasized high frequencies on these headphones, they do sound smooth and pleasurable to listen to for long periods of time.  But I really wish that these premium headphones from Sony offered a much more balanced sound.  You can manually tweak the EQ and boost the treble using your phone, MP3 player, stereo, or playback device to get a better balanced sound, but this should not be a necessary adjustment on $400 headphones.  Both with headphones and loudspeakers, I really prefer a neutral sound that does not emphasize either the bass, midrange, or treble.  And then if I do want more bass for some kinds of music (or for loudspeakers during a party), I can adjust the bass, treble, EQ, and ""Loudness"" settings to add more punch to my beat.  An accurate and balanced sound reproduction is best if, like me, you listen to many different genres of music. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:If you use these headphones in wireless Bluetooth mode, the Bluetooth 3.0 A2DP protocol used in these headphones has a maximum available bandwidth of 768 KBPS and Bluetooth utilizes audio compression to transmit the stereo sound.  So you will get more audio signal degradation when using these headphones in Bluetooth mode than when you plug these headphones in using the included 3.5mm audio cable.  This may not matter anyway if your music source is all MP3 files compressed with a low bit rate.  But using Bluetooth headphones is far more about the convenience of being liberated from not having wires dangling from your ears.  If your golden ears demand audiophile-grade CD-quality sound, Bluetooth is not the way to go :-)  But even when using these headphones in regular wired mode plugged into my stereo listening to CDs (and not MP3s), the sound is still too bass-heavy and not as crisp and clear as many other high-end over-the-ear headphones due to the lack of treble to balance the sound.  I still have an old Sony MDR-V6 headphones that I purchased in 1988, 25 years ago, that sounds far more balanced and neutral than this MDR-1RBT, and its price was just a small fraction of this headphones' price.  The MDR-V6 and this MDR-1RBT both use 40mm drivers.  While the MDR-V6 lacks the heavy punchy bass of this MDR-1RBT, the MDR-V6 is more enjoyable for listening to a wide variety of music, whereas this MDR-1RBT is better suited for music with a heavy beat.  Compared to other Bluetooth headphones currently on the market, I think that Sony currently has the best Bluetooth headphones with this MDR-1RBT model.  But I would have rated the sound quality 5-stars if there was more treble and a better balance of frequencies to the sound.  If sound quality is far more important to you than going wireless, or if you like listening to jazz and classical music, there are many better ways to spend $400 on headphones.Overall rating for this Sony MDR-1RBT: 3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV4N11OQDUSMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00948CFUC#wasThisHelpful","RV4N11OQDUSMQ","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: This bag is ideally suited for carrying weatherproofed action video camcorders like GoPro and Contour along with accessories. The drawstring cinching action works very well to quickly open and securely close the bag. The inside of the bag is lined with four webbed pockets and one nylon pocket of various sizes for lots of flexible storage options. The bag includes a carabiner attached to a sewn-in nylon loop for clipping the bag to other belts, backpacks, etc. The non-slip bottom allows the bag to easy stand upright on its own. Negatives: While the rear, bottom, and sides are padded, the front of this bag is jut one thin layer of nylon and does not provide any cushion protection. The interior pockets should have a zipper or Velcro closure to prevent items from falling out.Although the Amazon product listing currently describes this as a ""Luminosity DSA-101 Action Camera Case"", it really is not a camera ""case"", and Case Logic calls this their ""Luminosity Action Camera Bag"".  So perhaps the ""DSA"" in the DSA-101 model number should mean ""DrawString Action"" or ""Duffel Sack Action""?  At the time of this review's writing, the 'Product Description' incorrectly lists this as 'Fits Devices - 5.5""(l) x 4.6""(w) x 10""(h)'.  This is incorrect, and should say: 'Fits Devices - 5.5""(l) x 4.6""(w) x 9.1""(h)'.  After all, it is not physically possible for a bag with an external height of 9.3"" to have internal dimensions that fit a device that is 10"" long.  Although this bag is ideally suited for carrying weatherproofed action video camcorders such as GoPro and Contour, you can carry other electronics gear in this bag.  The product description says that you can store ""up to two action-cams"" with accessories.  This bag is roomy enough to carry at least three or four action cameras or point-and-shoot-sized cameras as long as you can organize them so that they do not bounce against each other during transport.  And there is plenty of room to bring along other mounting hardware or a GorillaPod flexible tripod.While this bag can hold a large DSLR camera or 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom lens, it is not a good bag for carrying larger electronics because there is insufficient padding around the entire bag to fully protect this kind of heavier gear.  While the rear, bottom, and sides are slightly padded, the front of this bag has a triangular panel consisting of just one single thin layer of ripstop nylon.  I really wish that this front section was also padded like the rest of the bag.  Using full wraparound padding would have added a small bit of weight to the 4.2-ounce bag, but the extra cushion protection would be useful for protecting electronics that are being carried in it.  Although GoPro and Contour cameras are fairly sturdy devices, I would still prefer that this bag be completely padded just in case it gets bumped around.This bag is entirely made of nylon.  The interior of the bag is lined with blue nylon on its padded rear, bottom, and sides, and the front of the interior consists of the single layer of unpadded black nylon.  The bag that I received slightly differs from a product photo that is currently posted for this bag.  The product photo shows a cutaway view where there are two webbed pockets on the rear panel, two taller webbed pockets on both sides, and two overlapping nylon pockets on the front panel.  My bag's interior has two webbed pockets on the rear panel, one taller webbed pocket on one side, one taller nylon pocket on the other side, and one webbed pocket on the front panel.  Regardless of which pocket arrangement is used for the bag that you receive, this does provide for lots of flexible options to store other accessories such as memory cards, batteries, cables, smartphone, MP3 player, earbud headphones, snack bars, etc.The interior pockets are too loose to securely hold memory cards, batteries, and other small items.  This not a problem if this bag remains upright at all times.  But since this is supposed to be an ""action camera bag"", when I tried hooking this bag to my CamelBak backpack while mountain biking rough technical terrain, I found that my memory cards, batteries, and other accessories had all fallen out of the pockets early on during my ride.  To fix this problem, I ended up cutting narrow quarter-inch-wide strips of adhesive-backed ""Industrial Strength Velcro Tape"" and I lined the mouth of each pocket with the Velcro.  So now the interior pockets of my bag are all outfitted with Velcro closures and my stuff no longer falls out of them :-)  But it would have been nice if this bag already had zippers or Velcro sewn into them to hold items more securely.The drawstring closure is innovative and allows the bag to be quickly opened and closed.  To open the bag, you pull two nylon loop handles in opposite directions.  To close the bag, you grab hold of two hypalon (synthetic rubber) tabs and pull them in opposite directions.  Drawstring closures usually either can become loose or require you to slide a clasp along the drawstring to prevent the string loop from loosening the closure.  This bag also uses a clasp to prevent the drawstring from inadvertently loosening, but you just have to set it up once and there is no need to adjust the clasp with each opening/closing of this bag.  Since I often take cameras along while skiing or snowshoeing, I tried opening and closing this bag while wearing ski gloves.  Opening the bag is very easy while wearing ski gloves since the two nylon loops are so easy to grab.  Closing the bag is also still easy because the small thumbnail-sized hypalon pull-tab is attached to the drawstring and I can just pull on the drawstring loop, while the other hypalon tab is three inches long and still easy to grab while wearing ski gloves.  While the two hypalon pull tabs and two nylon pull loops are attached to the bag using two layers of stitching and they seem quite durable, if any of the two tabs or pull loops separate from the bag due to stitching failure/fatigue, you can still open and close the bag, but it becomes more cumbersome.  So I would not use extreme force when pulling these tabs and loops.The top-rear of the bag has a nylon loop sewn into the bag, and the bag includes a carabiner for clipping the bag to your belt, backpack, other bags, etc.  Since the bag includes a pull-loop handle that you pull when opening up the bag, you can also clip the carabiner to the front-facing loop if you need that setup for some reason.Case Logic advertises that ""through snow, dirt, water and sand, action-cam users vary in activities"".  While the top of this bag can be very tightly cinch closed, there is still a possibility that a little bit of water, rain, melted snow, or mud may drip into the tiny hole that still remains after the top of the bag is closed up.  This will not matter if waterproof action cameras are stored inside, but it is something to consider if, for instance, you want to strap this bag to your waist while whitewater rafting.Overall, this is a nice bag to accompany your GoPro or Contour action camcorder.  It is too big to just carry a point-and-shoot camera, and it is not designed (or sufficiently padded) for carrying DSLR cameras or lenses.  I would have rated this 5 stars, instead of 4, if it included full wraparound padding on its front panel and if the interior pockets could be closed using zippers or Velcro.  This bag is overpriced if sold at $25 or $30, but it is more reasonable if you can buy this for $15 or $20.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEQWETQEL84O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVQ73IY#wasThisHelpful","R1WEQWETQEL84O","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.The author, Richard Templar, has written a number of other ""Rules of .."" books, including ""Rules of Life"", ""Rules of Work"", ""Rules of Money"", ""Rules of Management"", and ""Rules of Parenting"".  In this ""Rules of Love"" 239-page handbook-sized paperback, there are 107 rules, with each rule occupying two pages.  You already probably know most of the rules as many of them are common sense or they are related to empathy, compassion, and the ""golden rule"" (the ethic of reciprocity that you should treat people like you yourself want to be treated).  And many of the rules also apply to any kind of relationship beyond your love partner, e.g. your office co-workers, family members, and friends.  But the rules and the description of each rule is succinct enough to give us the thumping on the back of our heads to remind us yet again since all of us have been guilty of forgetting some of these rules while we are in a relationship, while we are dating, or while we are interacting with friends, family, or co-workers.  This is not the quintessential book on love and relationships, and there are undoubtedly various other rules that have not been mentioned here, but this is still a good and quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LO8T3T5FQR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133384225#wasThisHelpful","R6LO8T3T5FQR9","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.This vinpocetine is touted to promote better brain functioning.  Trying to objectively and accurately review this supplement based on possible improvements to brain and neural functions can be far too obscured by the ""if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work"" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  And since trying to evaluate one's own brain performance lies at the very core of one's subjective consciousness, trying to avoid this placebo effect for a brain/nerve supplement is much more difficult than if someone was trying to evaluate the efficacy of an nutritional supplement that promised to remove wrinkles on their face, grow more hair on their head, or cure their erectile dysfunction, all of which can be more objectively and visually evaluated than trying to decide if you have better memory and mental acuity due to this supplement.  And, depending upon your body and health, I really think that getting a good night of sleep can help with your brain's function more, and drinking a cup of coffee can also help you focus more.  Studies have shown that while you sleep, your brain consolidates information that you have previously acquired while your were awake and strengthens the neural connections that form your memory.  Having a good night of sleep also improves your focus and concentration on the next day.  And if you have bad dietary and exercise habits, taking this supplement may also not help your brain much since regular exercise has been shown to really improve brain function.  After trying this supplement for several months, I do not really feel any different.  But I also did not feel any bad side effects either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M2OTPN859GI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007A2E0W#wasThisHelpful","R2M2OTPN859GI4","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!Vitamin K is one of the lesser-known vitamins in the crowded supplement market.  During the past few decades, vitamin C, D, E, and B-complex vitamins have received much more publicity.  But vitamin K has a variety of multifaceted benefits for heart and bone health, your immune system, and it may also help fight or prevent some forms of cancer.  Since vitamin K plays a role in the coagulation of blood (e.g. to stop the flow of blood if you get a cut), you should not take this supplement if you are also taking anticoagulant drugs like Warfarin since they both have opposing and conflicting actions.  As with all supplements, you should consult with your doctor before taking this, especially if you have existing health ailments, are taking other medications, or experience adverse side effects from taking a supplement.One of vitamin K's prime functions is to maintain proper levels of blood clotting, letting your body clot blood, for example, if your skin gets cut in order to stop the bleeding.  But thrombosis can also occur if a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel, obstructing the blood flow and causing even more serious problems as a result.  Vitamin K protects bones from weakening or fracture.  The MK-4 form of vitamin K, in particular, can block formation of too many osteoclasts that can lead to excess bone demineralization.  Osteoclasts are bone cells that demineralize bones to make the bones' minerals available for other body functions.  But osteoclasts can sometimes create too much demineralization, thereby weakening bones.  Vitamin K helps to moderate this demineralization process.  Vitamin K protects against atherosclerosis and arterial calcification, which is commonly known as ""hardening of the arteries"".  As cells die over time, extracellular calcium is deposited and can build up along the inside of the arteries.  Vitamin K works with matrix gla protein (MGP) to block the formation of calcium crystals inside the blood vessels.Each of these softgel capsules contains 90 mcg (112% DV) of vitamin K2, as menaquinone-7 extracted from ""natto"", which is a Japanese food made from soybeans fermented with Bacillus subtilis bacteria.  Natto is naturally rich in vitamin K2, but its strong smell and flavor along with its slimy texture may offend Western palates.  If you get a chance to try eating natto, however, its health benefits extend far beyond its vitamin K2 content.  Natto may be purchased in some Japanese restaurants or Asian grocery stores.  Natto is also rich in protein, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, potassium, selenium, zinc, copper, and vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), and C.  Natto contains a nattokinase enzyme that may reduce blood clotting and help to avoid thrombosis that can lead to heart attacks, pulmonary embolism, or strokes.  It also contains compounds that have anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering effects.  If you like eating okra, which also has a slimy texture, then you will not mind the slimy natto and you just have to get an ""acquired taste"" for natto's odor and flavor.  Depending upon how the natto was prepared in the restaurant or how the natto was frozen for purchase at the grocery store, it may contain live cultures of the beneficial Bacillus subtilis bacteria just as yogurt contains live cultures of beneficial bacteria.  Bacillus subtilis is ubiquitous in the soil and human intestines.  Meat and eggs are the most common source of the MK-4 form of vitamin K2, whereas fermented soy is the most common food source of MK-7.  Just as yogurt bacteria can populate our intestines, the natto bacilli can stay alive in the intestines after the food is consumed and continue providing us with vitamin K2 in the MK-7 form.Along with vitamin K2, this Jarrow supplement also contains medium chain triglycerides, evening primrose oil, and soybean oil as other ingredients.  Vitamin D, E, and K supplements often are combined with oils like these in supplements because vitamins A/D/E/K are fat-soluble vitamins, whereas vitamins B and C are water-soluble.  This softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, water, and caramel (as a light barrier).  There are no wheat, gluten, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/tree nuts in the ingredients.  Because the capsules used in this Jarrow supplement are made of gelatin, which is derived from collagen obtained from various animal by-products, people who are pure vegans should not take this supplement.  If you are highly allergic to soy, note that this supplement does contain soy in the form of soybean oil.  While the natto fermented soybeans are only used as the source of this vitamin K2, it is unclear whether pure vitamin K2 is extracted for this supplement or whether the phytoestrogens that are present in soy also show up in this supplement.  While phytoestrogens are linked to benefits such as relief from perimenopausal symptoms (e.g. hot flushes and night sweats), prevention of osteoporosis, and cardiovascular health and the prevention of heart disease, phytoestrogens are also linked to disruptions of hormonal balances in infants and children because they can behave like a weak form of the human estrogen hormone.  Fermented soybean food, such as natto, tempeh, and soy sauce contain less phytoestrogens.  Tofu, which is not fermented, but is cultured like cheese, contains a moderate amount of phytoestrogens.  And edamame contains the most phytoestrogens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRZN519HFY8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OVVFA#wasThisHelpful","R3BRZN519HFY8I","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!This L-Carnosine is like the maid working at the hotel that is your body.  Its antioxidant functions can go through your body's cells and organs and vacuum up the superoxide free radicals and reactive oxygen species debris that was left by your body's various oxidative processes.  It is related to the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine; in other words, it is a protein building block.  It is mainly found in the brain, heart, and muscles, especially in the muscles of physically active people, although it is also present in the skin and digestive system.  Along with helping your body to age slower by increasing the replicative lifespan of the cells in some of your organs, it also neutralizes, prevents, or inhibits the deleterious side effects of many other biochemical by-products that are the result of your body's daily cell functions along with abnormalities caused by accidental malfunctioning of your body.  It has a large variety of benefits related to improving cell health and promoting healthy aging.  It can inhibit the glycosylation of proteins, which has been linked to aging of skin, brain, and eyes.  Studies have shown that it can prevent or slow the growth of senile cataracts in older people.  Some animal studies have shown it to slow the growth of cancers.  It also helps to protect your stomach, kidneys, and liver.  Some studies have shown that carnosine helps to protect the liver from oxidative stress and damage due to the consumption of alcohol.  Hmmm... I could have really used this supplement during my freshman year in college!  ;-)Each capsule of this supplement contains 500 mg of L-Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine).  The usage instructions for this Jarrow supplement say to take ""1 capsule 1 to 3 times per day with juice or water on an empty stomach"".  Since I tend to practice moderation with supplements and I do not subscribe to a mega-vitamin mega-dosage approach, I would suggest taking just one of these carnosine capsules per day instead of three.  Because this supplement increases the replicative lifespan of cells, allowing cells to divide into more cells for a longer period of time, there have been suggestions that carnosine could promote the growth of some cancers (even though it prevents the growth of other cancers) just as taking Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can increase the risk of getting some kinds of cancers.  The capsules used in this Jarrow supplement are made of gelatin, which is derived from collagen obtained from various animal by-products, so people who are pure vegans should not take this supplement.Despite this supplement's wide variety of benefits, this is one of those supplements where you will likely not notice any improvements to your health after taking it for a few weeks just because its benefits happen at such a subtle molecular level.  In fact, if anyone told me that they feel really great after taking this supplement for a few weeks, I would attribute it to a mental placebo effect in that they are convincing themselves that this supplement is doing great things inside their body and thus they feel great because of that.  So after taking this supplement for two months, while I cannot say that my health has markedly improved, I also did not experience any bad side effects from it.  Each capsule is about the size of a large oval vitamin.  If you frequently have problems swallowing larger pills, you can still wash this down your throat by drinking a lot of water after swallowing.Even if you live a very fit lifestyle, eat healthy meals, and exercise frequently, the daily cellular functions inside the hotel that is your body can still result in heavy metal rock bands checking into your body's hotel rooms.  One of these heavy metal rock bands that frequently uses your body's hotel rooms is called ""Free Radical!"" and another heavy metal band is called ""Reactive Oxygen Species"".  These rock bands, along with their adoring groupies, can repeatedly mess up your body's hotel rooms by partying through the night, setting guitars on fire, leaving strange stains on the bedsheets and drapes, dropping pizza slices all over the carpet, and making your hotel rooms look damaged and old.  Carnosine is like the dutiful maid who cringes at the sight of the mess that was left behind, takes a deep breath, and then proceeds to vacuum, wash, and clean out your body's hotel rooms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R154B281WHJA9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OVV4G#wasThisHelpful","R154B281WHJA9M","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.This is a pretty good zesty Italian mix when used as a salad dressing and as a marinade.  I actually like this better as a marinade because there are better Italian dressings out there when compared to using this mix.  Sugar and salt are the first two items listed in the ingredients listing, and its sugar and salt are a bit on the high side: 3 grams of sugar and 300 mg (12% RDA) per 1-teaspoon serving (which makes 2 tablespoons of dressing).  I would actually like the flavor even more if it was a bit less sweet.  This dressing mix contains autolyzed yeast extract.  Autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed proteins do contain a fair amount of glutamates, but nowhere near the glutamate concentration found in MSG.  So this autolyzed yeast is not the same as MSG.  But if you are highly sensitive to MSG or glutamates, you should not use this product.  Although I tend to avoid products containing MSG, I am not sensitive or allergic to it, and the use of autolyzed yeast is not a deal-breaker for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTGKHHBKEFRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B324T42#wasThisHelpful","R3UTGKHHBKEFRK","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.I live in a semi-arid climate where the humidity is low, and the air can be even more dry during the winter, leaving both my hair more frizzy and harder to control.  This frizz-control shampoo has a nice mild floral fragrance that is not too strong and overpowering.  It lathers up really well and rinses very clean.  Some frizz-control shampoos work by weighing down the hair more, but this shampoo still gives good volume to your hair.  Everyone's hair chemistry, thickness, and texture can be different, so I really do not think that there is a one-size-fits-all shampoo or conditioner that works well with every hair.  I think that this shampoo works best on thicker hair that is not as oily.  If your hair is thinner/finer or more oily, it may not work as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYIF6GK7YKJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAIOP44#wasThisHelpful","RLYIF6GK7YKJN","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.I live in a semi-arid climate where the humidity is low, and the air can be even more dry during the winter, leaving both my hair and scalp dry.  Although this conditioner treatment is referred to as ""Ultra Shea"", the shea butter smell is faint, and it has a much stronger floral smell to it.  I do not mind the fragrance, even though I would have preferred less fragrance, but the floral odor may be quite strong and overpowering for some people.  But this treatment mask washes out pretty cleanly without leaving your hair smelling too much like flowers.  And by the time that your hair totally dries, the fragrance subsides even more.  The strong floral fragrance goes right through the plastic of the tube and I can even smell the fragrance emanating from the closed-up tube as I initially step into the bathtub.This treatment mask comes out of the tube as a partially-separated striped orange/pink and white combination.  The white stripe is the nourishing treatment component and the orange/pink stripe is the ""concentrated Nutrium 10 technology"", which includes vitamins B5/C/E, aloe vera extract, and sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils... an interesting blend.  It looks a bit like the stripes that come out of Aquafresh toothpaste, but not as cleanly separated.  Just like the striping in Aquafresh toothpaste, this two-toned blend (what they call a ""bi-phase formula"") is probably just a marketing gimmick, and they probably could have just pre-blended everything together.The treatment mask is not creamy smooth like some masks, but it is rather thick, so it does not spread out as easily, requiring me to use more product.  Because of this, I can see how this 6-fluid-ounce bottle may not last long if you have lots of long hair.  But at least this product is quite inexpensive.  I do wish that this treatment mask was easier to spread and massage into my hair and scalp.The instructions on the tube say: ""Use bi-weekly in place of Clear Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner"".  But the word ""bi-weekly"" is a classic ambiguity of the English language: all dictionaries define ""bi-weekly"" to mean either ""twice a week"" or ""every two weeks"", and dictionaries define ""bi-monthly"" to also mean either ""twice a month"" or ""every two months"".  Hmmm...  While this is not important for a hair product, this ambiguity of the ""bi-weekly"" word's meaning could be very important if a doctor wrote you a prescription to take a medication on a bi-weekly basis.  When I used this treatment every two weeks, my hair felt soft and silky.  But when I tried using this treatment twice a week, my hair still felt soft, but it also felt too limp and too lax.  So I really think that this ""bi-weekly"" treatment should be for every two weeks, and using it twice a week is four times too much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCTI810BQQX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AE0790U#wasThisHelpful","RNCTI810BQQX0","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies! But the pump container needs to be replaced with a simple squeeze tube!!Living in this dry mountain air, I always welcome any kind of moisturizing skin care, especially since I love being outside in the great outdoors and playing up in the mountains both during winter and summer.  And if the moisturizer also smooths out wrinkles, that is an added bonus!  Several of us, all in our forties, first started using this last autumn, and we all give it a thumbs-up.  This does help to smooth out fine lines, especially around the eye area and forehead region, and when used twice a day, our skin felt smoother and tighter.  Larger wrinkles and crow's feet will not totally disappear, but they do become less noticeable over time with regular usage of this lotion.  This lotion has a nice creamy feel and smell to it.  Although everyone's skin sensitivities and allergies may differ, none of our ""test panel"" of users experienced any allergic reactions, rashes, or itchiness from using this product.But I am removing one whole star rating because the pump dispenser is really annoying to use when a simple squeeze tube would have been both easier to use and also more compact to carry.  Sometimes, the pump may even clog so no lotion can be pumped out.  In that case, you have to pry up the entire pump mechanism; the pump comes apart fairly easily after a bit of prying.  With the pumped now removed, you can just dip a finger into the tub to get lotion out.  The red cap and black pump can then be snapped back onto the tub.  But if you are unable to clear the clog on the pump, then you need to pry off the pump again when you use the lotion later.  When the container became empty and would no longer pump out more lotion, I pried off the pump part and found that there was still some lotion left inside the tub that could have been extracted if it was dispensed from a more flexible squeeze tube.  Since this lotion is not cheap, I would want every drop of lotion that I paid for.  So Olay should have packaged this lotion in a simple squeeze tube.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CL9M1JF7OF28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00796ND3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2CL9M1JF7OF28","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies. Positives: Hundreds of verbs that are good for use in resumes are alphabetized and grouped into categories in three chapters pertaining to ""Soft Skills"", ""Hard Skills"", and ""Experience, Credentials, Education"". Each verb includes a definition and possible synonyms. Negatives: Some of the included verbs are too prosaic and pedestrian; these common verbs should have been left out to focus on verbs that add more oomph to a resume. Some of the included verbs are slang or too obscure, and also should have been left out of this book. Although most of the verbs include one example usage as a bullet point in a resume, because verbs often have multiple contexts and meanings, more example uses should have been provided for many of the verbs to help spark readers' imagination and help readers adapt the verb to their own resume and employment situations. A discussion should have been included about how the use of these verbs in the passive tense can lack power compared to using them in the active tense.This book contains hundreds of verbs that the author considers to be ""power verbs"".  ""Power verbs"" are not a new concept; ""power verbs"" are sometimes also called ""action verbs"".  I heard about using ""action verbs"" in resumes decades ago.  This ""Power Verbs For Job Seekers"" book does a nice job of collecting hundreds of verbs and organizing them into three chapters based on ""Soft Skills"" (which relate more to your personality), ""Hard Skills"" (which relate more to job requirements), and ""Experience, Credentials, Education"".  Each chapter is further divided into categories and the verbs are then listed alphabetically in each category.Many of the verbs included in this book can add persuasive power to your resume.  However, there are also far too many common verbs that really are not ""power verbs"" and including them into this book just adds more clutter for the reader to sift through.  Seriously, do we really need ""help"", ""gave"", or ""make"" to be included in a listing of ""power verbs""?  The listing for ""Make"" also includes 24 synonym verbs, all of which have more power than the ""make"" verb itself.  The listing for the ""Make"" verb uses an example bullet point of: ""Made 20% more prototypes in the same time frame than any department"".  If you replace that ""Made"" with ""Created"", ""Built"", ""Invented"", or ""Fabricated"", you get a more descriptive and powerful action verb.  In another separate listing for ""Make"", there is an example bullet point of: ""Made industry 'Top Ten Performers' five consecutive years (2007-2012)"".  Likewise, this phrase would have more oomph if it replaced ""Made"" with ""Achieved"": ""Achieved industry 'Top Ten Performers' five consecutive years (2007-2012)"".  Because verbs often have multiple meanings depending upon how they are used, most of the verbs in this book should have included more than one example resume bullet point to provide readers with more ideas on how to apply the verbs to their own resume situation.Some of the verbs included in this book definitely should not have been included at all, either because they contribute nothing to the content of a resume or because they are too obscure.  For example, the author considers ""banter"" to be a power verb, with an example usage of ""The sales team bantered with the accounting team about the viability of some accounts"".  Hmm... that does not sound powerful or persuasive if used either in a resume, cover letter, or job interview.The author obviously likes the slang term of ""carry the water"", including it in five different sections of this book.  But many people, including myself, do not know what slang wording like this means.  When I asked several friends and co-workers of various ages what ""carry the water"" meant, they did not know either.  Even when I researched the phrase, ""carry the water"" has several meanings involving responsibility, performing a task, and it has another meaning when used in golf.  ""Carry the water"" also sounds similar to ""carrying water weight"", or feeling bloated.  So casual ambiguous jargon like ""carry the water"" should definitely be left out of resumes and job interviews.  There are enough useful power verbs that everyone can understand so you do not have to resort to slang or obscure verbs to get your point across.As another example, ""elucbrate"" and ""lucubrate"" are included in this book as power verbs (but ""ululate"" is not considered a power verb ;-)  While these words may help you appear to be really smart while playing Scrabble with friends, they really should not be used either in a resume or during a job interview.  Many hiring managers quickly skim over stacks of resumes, spending less than 20 seconds per resume, and adding really obscure verbs into your resume may just cause the reader to ignore the word or, even worse, become annoyed at the inclusion of obscure words.  Furthermore, the author got tripped up by his own obscure verbs by including the misspelling of ""elucbrate"", which is misspelled in two different sections of this book; the correct spelling for ""elucbrate"" is ""elucubrate"".  But both ""elucubrate"" and ""lucubrate"" should be avoided in resumes.  If you mention ""Last year, I lucubrated all night to prepare my sales presentation"" during a job interview, the hiring manager might think that you said ""I lubricated all night..."" instead ;-)Because a resume is like a persuasive sales brochure that you are using to sell yourself, it is important to not only choose the optimum actions verbs, but also to choose the optimum way to phrase these power verbs.  Unfortunately, there is no discussion in this book about using verbs in the active tense (or active voice) instead of the passive tense.  An example of a passive tense phrase in a resume would be: ""Sales were improved 18% by using a new tracking system that I implemented.""  Converting this phrase to an active tense sounds more persuasive in a resume: ""I implemented a new tracking system that improved sales by 18%.""  Using an active tense emphasizes more that the job seeker was directly responsible for the actions, instead of merely implying that something happened as a result of the job seeker's actions. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Overall, this is a useful book, particularly if you are often at a loss for words and stuck trying to find a good verbal expression.  If you decide to purchase this book, the ""Kindle Edition"" is more useful because you can quickly search through the book for verbs instead of flipping pages back and forth.  But this book could have been far more useful if it included many other more powerful verbs.  For example, ""evaluate"", ""strategize"", ""delegate"", ""simplify"", ""inspect"", ""regulate"", ""influenced"", ""crafted"", ""persuade"", and ""enable"" are all not included in this book.  And this book really needs to exclude some of the slang wording and obscure verbs.  This book is definitely not comprehensive in its listing of verbs that are useful for job seekers.  If you search the Internet for ""power verbs"" or ""action verbs"", you can amass many more additional power verbs for writing in resumes and speaking during job interviews.Thank you for reading this review that I lucubrated and elucubrated ;-)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQIFJI66URC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133158721#wasThisHelpful","RAQIFJI66URC9","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies. (I actually rate this 3.5 stars instead of a full 4.0 stars) Packaging, Style, Appearance:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Construction & Build Quality:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Ergonomics & Comfort:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Sound Quality:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Competitive Pricing & Value:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Positives: Along with being used as regular wired headphones, these headphones can connect wirelessly either by pairing to a Bluetooth device or by touching to an NFC-compatible smartphone. These headphones are light in weight and extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods. These are one of the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones that I have ever worn on my larger-than-average head. Even though a headphones' appearance should not matter, these Sony headphones look as good and stylish as some of the other trendier hip headphone brands on the market. It feels quite liberating to not have my ears tethered to regular wired headphones or earbuds. Operating a smartphone while wearing these headphones works well. Negatives: These premium-priced headphones are mostly made of plastic parts. The bass response is overemphasized and slightly muddy. There is not enough higher-frequency treble to add crispness and sparkle to the sound and to balance the heavy bass response; the lack of treble can really dull the sound. A 90-day labor warranty is too stingy for $400 headphones.What is in the box package? Sony MDR-1RBT Bluetooth headphones 20-inch USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable 5-foot 3.5mm audio cable for plugging the headphones into a regular mini-jack ""Quick Start Guide"" foldout sheet ""Reference Guide"" foldout sheet Nylon drawstring carrying pouch with soft interior liningDuring the 1980s and 1990s, long before Bose came on the headphones scene, and even longer before Dr. Dre Beats became a hip fashion statement, Sony, Audio-Technica, and Sennheiser were making some amazing high-end headphones.  While Audio-Technica and Sennheiser have continued offering great headphones across the entire price range, it seems that during the past ten to twenty years, Sony has focused more of their headphones product line on less expensive headphones and earbuds, perhaps to cater more to the iPod/MP3 generation instead of to audiophiles who are listening at home with their headphones plugged into stereo equipment.  These Sony MDR-1RBT Bluetooth headphones are a premium product: premium in design and features, and definitely premium in pricing.These headphones are packaged inside a softly-lined black box that looks more like a gift box, as if you were opening up a fancy box containing jewelry.  Inside the box are the headphones, a 20-inch USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable to charge up the headphones when used in wireless Bluetooth mode, a 5-foot 3.5mm audio cable for connecting the headphones as regular wired headphones, and two foldout guide sheets.  The drawstring carrying pouch is lined with a soft fabric and has a smaller pocket inside it that is useful for carrying the two cables and two foldout guide sheets that come with the headphones.These over-the-ear headphones are very comfortable to wear, with the surrounding cushions feeling very soft and sumptuous.  These are definitely one of the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones that I have ever worn!  My head is larger than average (e.g. most bicycle helmets are too small for me), and some headphones clamp on my head too tightly, but I can wear these headphones for several hours in total comfort.  Because they totally surround your ears with a soft pleather-like cushion, they can feel more warm to wear for an extended period compared to on-the-ear headphones, especially if you wear them outside or wear them while moving around, due to the heat from your body that gets trapped inside the ear-cups.Weighing 10.5 ounces, these headphones feel relatively light.  However, this light weight is achieved by mainly using plastic parts in this headphones' construction.  The headband uses a band of metal, but most of the parts are made of plastic, including some shiny plastic parts that are colored to look like metal.  The ear-cups are connected to plastic hinges, which does not give the impression of long-term durability.  With all the plastic used in its construction, the build quality of this MDR-1RBT feels cheap.  For $400 premium-priced headphones, I would expect more lightweight aluminum, magnesium, or titanium metals being used in the headphones' construction, even if that added a bit more weight to the overall design, for better long-term durability.  And for premium-priced headphones using not-so-premium build quality, these headphones only have a short 90-day labor warranty, although the parts warranty is for 1 year.  Sony should have at least included an all-inclusive labor-and-parts 1 year warranty for these headphones.The plastic rims of both ear-cups contain various controls and input jacks.  The left ear-cup has the power button for using the headphones wirelessly, the Micro-USB port for plugging in the recharging cable to recharge the internal non-user-replaceable lithium ion battery for wireless use, a ""Reset"" button for resetting the Bluetooth connection, the audio input jack for the 3.5mm audio cable for wired use, a microphone opening for phone use, and a red/blue indicator light to show the power or communication status of the headphones.  The right ear-cup has +/- volume buttons, an NFC on/off slider witch to enable/disable the NFC one-touch connection, a forward/reverse/play/pause jog switch for music functions, a phone button to control call functions, and there is an ""N"" NFC logo on the right ear-cup where you touch a smartphone to active the NFC connection.  Once you get used to the location of the controls, they have pretty good ergonomics and are easy to locate while you wear the headphones.  The most-frequently used controls are located on the right side.  If you are left-handed and prefer to operate most of the controls with your left hand, you can wear the headphones with the right channel on your left ear and the headphones fit just as well.There are three ways to connect these headphones to an audio source: (1) Use the included 5-foot 3.5mm audio cable to connect the headphones like regular wired headphones; (2) Pair and wirelessly connect the headphones to a Bluetooth device; and (3) Touch and wirelessly connect the headphones to an iOS or Android smartphone using NFC (Near Field Communication).  If your Android phone can connect via NFC, you need to download Sony's ""NFC Easy Connect"" app in order to use this feature.  If your phone is housed inside a thicker carrying case, that can impede the NFC detection when you touch the phone to the right ear-cup.  But pairing these headphones to a Bluetooth-connected smartphone or device is just as easy and you can wirelessly connect to more devices using Bluetooth, so I tend to mainly use the Bluetooth connection more.  The Bluetooth connection was always reliable and consistent.  As with most Bluetooth devices, these headphones have a line-of-sight Bluetooth range of about 30 feet.  Walls, floors, and other obstacles will reduce the range at which these headphones can be separated from the Bluetooth device.  Using the included 20-inch USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable, it takes about 6 hours to fully charge up the headphones' internal lithium ion battery for wireless use.  Once it is charged up, you get up to 30 hours of music and phone usage time out of the headphones.Sony advertises that these headphones have a ""frequency response"" of 4 Hz to 80 kHz.  The specifications for many audio/stereo components typically list ""frequency response"" as a +/-3 dB range; i.e. the range of frequencies that the headphones or loudspeakers can play back within a +/-3 dB variation of accuracy.  Most humans can hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, although some people can detect down to 15 Hz and up to 25 kHz.  So for Sony to publish a ""frequency response"" for these headphones of 4 Hz to 80 kHz"" is absurd because (1) playing frequencies higher than 30 kHz is pretty useless unless you are buying these headphones for a bat, or for your pet dog, cat, or hamster, who can hear the ultra-high frequencies far better than humans, and (2) more importantly, the 40mm drivers used in these headphones cannot accurately reproduce either a very low earthquake-shaking 4 Hz frequency or an extremely high 80kHz frequency.  In fact, most high-quality headphones can play a tiny smidgen of an actual 4 Hz or 80 kHz sound, but the sound volume of the 4 Hz extremely-low-bass frequency will be much lower than bass frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz.A far more indicative audio specification for these headphones is Sony's listing of these headphones' ""effective frequency range"" of 100 Hz to 4000 Hz.  The ""effective frequency range"" typically denotes the frequency range beyond which, in this case, frequencies lower than 100 Hz and higher than 4000 Hz taper off to less than 10 dB.  The midrange frequencies that encompass most vocals go out to about 5000 Hz, although the range between 2500 Hz and 5000 Hz is sometimes referred to as ""low treble"".  The higher treble frequencies add crispness and clarity to vocals since vocal content often goes out to 7000 or 8000 Hz, and treble frequencies also give cymbals and stringed instruments their sparkle, and give electric guitars their sizzle.  The bass-heavy sound of these headphones give me an impression of being a bit muddy.  This may also be due to the headphones' emphasis on bass and midrange frequencies and not enough high frequencies to provide a more balanced sound.  The midrange frequencies of these headphones sound smooth and warm, and all percussion sounds have a strong punchy feel to them, but the treble sounds more muted.These headphones are best suited for electronic music, dance music, rap, hip-hop, and modern pop music.  Talk radio and the voice of late-night jazz DJs also sound warm and full.  However, because the high-frequency treble is lacking, I would not recommend these headphones if you mainly listen to classical music.  Since I listen to a very wide variety of music, I do not like these headphones as much for classical music and jazz, and rock music does not sound as good because the electric guitars, vocals, and cymbals do not sound as crisp.  Acoustic guitars, violins, and harps lack sparkle in their upper timbres.  So these headphones do not have a bright high-frequency sizzle to their sound, which may or may not be to your liking.  Some headphones can sound too strident during extended listening due to the overemphasis of high frequencies, and with the subdued underemphasized high frequencies on these headphones, they do sound smooth and pleasurable to listen to for long periods of time.  But I really wish that these premium headphones from Sony offered a much more balanced sound.  You can manually tweak the EQ and boost the treble using your phone, MP3 player, stereo, or playback device to get a better balanced sound, but this should not be a necessary adjustment on $400 headphones.  Both with headphones and loudspeakers, I really prefer a neutral sound that does not emphasize either the bass, midrange, or treble.  And then if I do want more bass for some kinds of music (or for loudspeakers during a party), I can adjust the bass, treble, EQ, and ""Loudness"" settings to add more punch to my beat.  An accurate and balanced sound reproduction is best if, like me, you listen to many different genres of music. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:If you use these headphones in wireless Bluetooth mode, the Bluetooth 3.0 A2DP protocol used in these headphones has a maximum available bandwidth of 768 KBPS and Bluetooth utilizes audio compression to transmit the stereo sound.  So you will get more audio signal degradation when using these headphones in Bluetooth mode than when you plug these headphones in using the included 3.5mm audio cable.  This may not matter anyway if your music source is all MP3 files compressed with a low bit rate.  But using Bluetooth headphones is far more about the convenience of being liberated from not having wires dangling from your ears.  If your golden ears demand audiophile-grade CD-quality sound, Bluetooth is not the way to go :-)  But even when using these headphones in regular wired mode plugged into my stereo listening to CDs (and not MP3s), the sound is still too bass-heavy and not as crisp and clear as many other high-end over-the-ear headphones due to the lack of treble to balance the sound.  I still have an old Sony MDR-V6 headphones that I purchased in 1988, 25 years ago, that sounds far more balanced and neutral than this MDR-1RBT, and its price was just a small fraction of this headphones' price.  The MDR-V6 and this MDR-1RBT both use 40mm drivers.  While the MDR-V6 lacks the heavy punchy bass of this MDR-1RBT, the MDR-V6 is more enjoyable for listening to a wide variety of music, whereas this MDR-1RBT is better suited for music with a heavy beat.  Compared to other Bluetooth headphones currently on the market, I think that Sony currently has the best Bluetooth headphones with this MDR-1RBT model.  But I would have rated the sound quality 5-stars if there was more treble and a better balance of frequencies to the sound.  If sound quality is far more important to you than going wireless, or if you like listening to jazz and classical music, there are many better ways to spend $400 on headphones.Overall rating for this Sony MDR-1RBT: 3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68P7E80UH8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009A6D034#wasThisHelpful","R68P7E80UH8G","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies (but best suited for foods that are not too juicy or smelly).Bumkins currently has 11 different colors and patterns for these reusable sandwich and snack bags.  I have the ""Bright Blue"" bag with the Cat In The Hat and Thing 1 and Thing 2 romping around on the bag.  This is a fun design for both kids and adults.  Although the product description says that this bag measures 7""x7"", the bag that I received was 7.0"" long and only 6.5"" wide.  It is still roomy enough to hold most sandwiches although overstuffed sandwiches may not fit inside.Because this is a zippered bag, it is neither airtight nor watertight.  Prior to using this bag for the first time, I washed the inside of the bag and while I was rinsing it, I filled the bag halfway full with water to see how watertight the seams were.  A little bit of water was oozing out from the bottom corners of the bag (the two corners opposite the zippered side) along with some water slowly dripping out from one spot in the middle of the seam that is opposite the zippered side.  And if the bag is zipped up, water leaks out freely along the entire length of the zippered side.  So I would not store any fruit slices, juicy sandwiches, or other moist items inside this bag because the fluids would leak out through the zippered side.  I would also not store any food that had a strong smell to it because the odor would filter through the zipper fabric.  For example, I used this bag to hold a sandwich that had Dijon mustard in it.  After the sandwich was left inside the bag for an entire morning, the mustard smell had permeated through the zipper and filled my outer sack with mustard odor.  A well-designed Ziploc baggie or a plastic container would keep food odors from leaking out.This bag is reusable and it can be washed either in the laundry or in the dishwasher.  But for many years now, I have always hand-washed and reused baggies, sandwich bags, and Ziploc bags, letting them air-dry while being propped open by the rails of a dish rack.  I only throw away a Ziploc bag if the plastic has been torn or if the Ziploc closure no longer forms a tight seal.  I also wash and reuse the Ziploc bags that shredded cheese is sold in because the both the plastic and the Ziploc closure on those bags are often more durable than the Ziploc bags that are sold as sandwich bags.These Bumkins bags are best used with sandwiches or snacks that are dry or not too moist, and do not have much of a strong odor.  For foods that have more moisture content or odor, a Ziploc bag is a better choice.  And if you need the food to be stored in a crushproof container, then a plastic food container is the best choice.  I wish that this bag was also available in a larger size, and was also available with a watertight/airtight Ziploc closure instead of the fabric zipper closure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVX0G1GIHT0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00814ZBYW#wasThisHelpful","RZVX0G1GIHT0F","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies (but the slim interior space is better suited either for a laptop with a compact slim AC adapter, or an 11-inch or 13-inch ultrabook or MacBook Air).The first thing that I noticed about this laptop briefcase was how light and slim it was.  This briefcase only weighs 21 ounces (1 pound 5 ounces), including the shoulder strap, which is lighter than many laptop bags.  The exterior feels like soft neoprene while all interiors are lined with nylon.  The main laptop compartment has dimensions of 15.25 inches wide and 11.25 inches deep, and can accomodate a laptop of 15.2""x10.5""x1.7"".  Inside the main laptop compartment is an 8.0-inch wide sleeve that perfectly fits my iPad 2.  My iPad 2 is covered with the excellent Targus VuScape Protective Cover/Stand for Apple iPad 2 - 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, WiFi and WiFi + 3G  THZ044US (Black/Blue Interior), and this interior tablet sleeve is nicely sized to hold my iPad securely with the Targus cover left on.  The Targus cover doubles the thickness of the iPad to 0.7 inches thick, but it will still easily fit inside the tablet sleeve.Because the briefcase is fairly slim, however, storing the iPad with its Targus cover, my Dell 15-inch laptop, and the Dell's chunky AC adapter made for a very snug fit.  I initially stored the AC adapter vertically along one edge of the laptop compartment, but, even then, it zipped up into a bulging compartment that also put extra strain on the main zipper.  Finally, I decided that it was just easier to carry the AC adapter in the outside zippered compartment.  This creates a bulging outer pocket, but it is easier and quicker to store the AC adapter in the outer compartment than to arrange it each time vertically squeezed into one side of the main laptop compartment.  And with my AC adapter squeezed inside the main compartment, I worried about straining the main compartment's zipper too much.  The outside zippered compartment is almost as wide and high as the main laptop compartment, albeit not as deep.  The inside wall of this outside zippered compartment has another zippered pocket that is as wide as the main briefcase and can also hold a tablet, and I sometimes store my iPad inside this pocket instead.  This outer pocket may be used as a tablet storage option if you have a thicker laptop and you need extra room inside the main laptop compartment.  The rear of the briefcase has a small zippered pocket and a trolley pass-through sleeve for slipping this briefcase onto the pull-handle of another luggage.The included shoulder strap is comfortable.  However, I would have much preferred that the shoulder strap used metal clips.  Instead, the shoulder strap uses plastic clips that clip onto plastic D-rings on the briefcase.  While I prefer metal D-rings instead of plastic D-rings for durability, I really dislike these kinds of plastic shoulder strap clips when used on a briefcase that is carrying the weight of a laptop (and tablet).  And over time, the plastic clips can fatigue and bend or break after repeatedly attaching/detaching the shoulder strap by pressing down on the plastic, or by the weight of the loaded briefcase repeatedly straining the J-shaped hook of the plastic clips.Overall, this is a good basic nicely-styled briefcase for a 15-inch laptop.  The tablet storage sleeve feature is nice, but since many laptop bags and briefcases already have extra zippered compartments that can separately store a tablet anyway, I think that this tablet sleeve feature only adds a moderate amount of uniqueness to the design.  This is a fine briefcase for carrying back and forth between the office or coffee shop.  But in my opinion, it is too lightweight, not padded enough, and not roomy enough to take with me on business trips, air flights, and travel outings.  And if your laptop uses an AC adapter that is like a small brick (like my Dell AC adapter), you either have to *squeeze* it into this sleek briefcase's main laptop compartment or keep it in the outside zippered compartment; in both cases, this briefcase's slim profile then no longer looks sleek and bulges outward.  Even thin 15-inch ultrabook laptops often have somewhat chunky AC adapters.If your 15-inch or smaller laptop uses a slim compact AC adapter and you do not need to carry various other folders/binders, mice, and laptop peripherals, then this briefcase can be quickly packed and retain its nice sleek look, and this briefcase may work just fine for you.  Likewise, this is a great lightweight bag to carry an 11-inch or 13-inch ultrabook or MacBook Air.  But for my 15-inch laptop needs, especially when traveling through airports, the main interior laptop compartment of this briefcase really needed to be an additional quarter-inch wider/thicker inside it so I could store my AC adapter brick vertically inside without having the nylon/neoprene bulge outward.  For carrying my laptop to the office, I can just quickly store my mouse and other peripherals in the outside zippered compartment, which adds protruding bulges to this outside pocket.  But when traveling, and for extra protection, I would rather have enough room inside the briefcase to store my mouse.So I rate this briefcase 4 stars mainly for people who do not have a thick chunky AC adapter and who do not need to carry a larger-sized mouse or too many other peripherals or folders/books/papers.  For those people, this is a great briefcase with a slim profile and a light weight that can complement the light three-pound or four-pound weight of an ultrabook.  But for my own use with a 15-inch laptop, this briefcase is a bit too slim, and if it was just an extra quarter-inch wider/thicker in its main laptop compartment, I would have then rated it 5 stars.  I have both a 11-inch and a 13-inch laptop and I use this briefcase to carry those instead of my 15-inch laptops.  I also use a Lenovo 14-inch Y410P laptop that, at 5.5 pounds, is thicker than most 14-inch laptops, and the 14-inch laptop, its AC adapter brick, and my iPad can all snugly fit inside this briefcase without straining the zipper.  But when Case Logic designed this briefcase to carry a 15-inch laptop, they forgot to take into account the fact that many laptops use a large chunky AC adapter, and this internal space issue could have been easily corrected by making this briefcase slightly wider.I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper to decide if this Case Logic briefcase is suitable for your needs! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UD7V5PH62OVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TK9LR2#wasThisHelpful","R1UD7V5PH62OVJ","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies! Positives: This hard drive is indeed very slim, with its 9.5mm thickness being comparable to an internal laptop hard drive. The read/write transfer speeds are pretty fast for a 5400-RPM hard drive (but performance will feel slower if you are accustomed to using 7200-RPM drives). By installing a Windows or Mac driver, you can use either the Windows or Mac version of this drive on both Windows and Mac computers, which is great for transferring files in between both platforms. This drive comes in 500-GB, 1-TB, 2-TB, and 4-TB capacities with different color options for the top metal panel. Negatives: While the Seagate Dashboard software that is pre-loaded on the hard drive includes very useful and flexible backup software, the other two parts of the software to share files to social media sites and save files from social media sites are limited in their usefulness and flexibility. If you are relying on the Seagate Dashboard software to backup all of your user files, such as documents and emails, Dashboard will not backup hidden files, so you need to unhide all folders and files in your C:\Users\ folder by unchecking the folders' or files' ""Hidden"" property attribute.With a thickness of 9.5mm for the 500-GB drive, this very portable little drive is only slightly thicker than an iPhone or pencil, and its thickness is comparable to many internal laptop/notebook drives. But while 9.5mm-thick internal laptop drives do not have an external case covering them, this drive is housed inside an attractive anodized aluminum metal case, with a plastic bottom base, that gives it a solidly rigid feel to the drive. The hard drive that is housed inside the case may even be thinner than a 7mm internal hard drive. So this external hard drive is actually thinner than most internal laptop/ultrabook hard drives. And the 500-GB drive weighs only 5 ounces, making this an extremely portable drive to carry around. With a thickness of 12.0mm, the 1-TB and 2-TB versions of this drive are 2.5mm thicker and slightly heavier than the 500-GB version. But a 12.0mm-thick drive casing is still tiny for a 2-TB external drive. There are some 15mm-thick 2-TB internal drives that are thicker than this, and they do not have an external case.This hard drive comes with an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable. While this cable length is adequate for plugging into a laptop, I wish that the supplied cable was just a little longer in length (24 inches would be ideal) to allow more flexibility when connecting the hard drive to a desktop computer. My desktop computers are connected to USB hubs located on my desk so the cable is not too short for me, but many people will plug this hard drive directly into their desktop computer's USB port.This drive is whisper quiet and when it is plugged into the USB port, a thin sliver of light glows near one corner of the top of the case to show that it is operational. While this drive is either reading or writing data, the glowing light pulsates, slowly shifting between dim and bright, instead of just blinking like most hard drive status lights. The pulsating hard drive status light looks more unique than the usual blinking light used by other external hard drives, as if the hard drive is breathing in and out while it works. My one minor quibble is that I wish the light would pulsate at a quicker pace. With a blinking hard drive activity LED, I can quickly glance over at the light and see if it is blinking. With this slowly pulsating light, I have to stare at the sliver of light for several seconds to see if the drive is reading/writing. As with all non-SSD hard drives, when I hold this drive in my hand, I can feel its body vibrating due to the spinning platter that is inside, and if I press my ear right up to the case while the drive is reading or writing data, I can just barely hear the read/write head moving around inside. So this hard drive is as quiet as the quietest of internal drives designed for notebooks.I have seen various reviews erroneously mention that this Seagate Slim drive is either a 7200-RPM drive or a SSD drive, but both of those descriptions are incorrect. While Seagate previously used 7200-RPM drives in their GoFlex Slim drives, this Slim drive uses a 5400-RPM drive. For a 5400-RPM hard drive though, its transfer speeds are pretty good. This hard drive connects through a USB 3.0 cable, and as with all USB 3.0 devices being backwardly compatible with USB 2.0, you will only get the faster USB 3.0 speeds if you connect this drive to a USB 3.0 port. Connecting this drive to a USB 2.0 port will result in slower transfer speeds. When tested using the ""HD Tune"" hard drive performance benchmarking tool on an older laptop with USB 2.0 ports, I get an average read speed of 28 MB/s and an average write speed of 21 MB/s. Connecting this drive to a newer laptop having USB 3.0 ports, I get an average read speed of 92 MB/s (with maximum peaks of around 112 MB/s) and an average write speed of 86 MB/s. Even though most 7200-RPM notebook-sized hard drives will be faster, these speeds are pretty fast for a 5400-RPM hard drive. If you want the fastest speeds using this Seagate Slim drive, you need to plug it into a USB 3.0 port. This rule applies to any external storage device that uses a USB 3.0 cable. Perhaps Seagate chose to not include a faster 7200-RPM hard drive inside this tiny thin enclosure because of potential heat and reliability issues?If I read or write hundreds of megabytes of data, the exterior of the drive does get warm over time since there is no internal cooling fan or ventilation holes in this drive's casing, but it usually does not get too hot. On one occasion, however, I was copying many very large HD video files onto this drive, and after twenty minutes of transferring HD videos back and forth where this hard drive was reading and writing non-stop, the drive's enclosure felt very hot when I touched it, so I undocked and unplugged the drive to let it cool down because I was worried about adversely affecting the drive's long-term reliability by continuing to operate it with the temperature inside its enclosure being so hot. The drive enclosure's metal top surface cooled down after about fifteen minutes, and I then plugged the drive back into my laptop and proceeded to edit the HD videos that were now loaded onto the drive. Because this tiny hard drive is housed in such a small totally-sealed enclosure, you should let it cool down sometimes if feels too hot after extended periods of reading/writing data. Avoiding repetitive overheating is a good idea for any external hard drive that lacks a cooling fan or ventilation holes in the hard drive's enclosure since heat can degrade a hard drive's performance and reliability over time. With most electronic components, repeatedly overheating the electronics can cause hardware failures and overheating is the primary cause of hard drive failure. Also avoid bumping, jarring, or dropping this hard drive, especially when it is plugged in.About 800 MB of this drive's space is used up by the pre-loaded Seagate Dashboard software and brief tutorial videos on using the Seagate Dashboard software to protect and back up your files, save social media files, and conveniently share image and video files that are stored on this drive to Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube. If you are certain that you do not ever want to use this Dashboard software, you can delete the 'Seagate Dashboard Installer.dmg' Mac software file, the 'Seagate Dashboard Installer.exe' Windows software file, and the 'Video' folder to free up hundreds of megabytes of disk space. A 'Seagate' folder that is in the root directory contains a 'SerialNumber.xml' file that has the model number and serial number of the drive. The model number and serial number are also printed on the bottom panel of the drive however. In the Windows version of this drive, the 'Seagate' folder has a 'Seagate-Release.exe' program that you can run to register the drive with Seagate. After you finish registering the drive, you can delete the 'Seagate' folder.If you want to leave the software and tutorial videos on the drive, you can still delete either the 135-MB 'Seagate Dashboard Installer.dmg' Mac software file or the 156-MB 'Seagate Dashboard Installer.exe' Windows software file if you only exclusively use Mac or Windows computers. In the 'Video' folder, there are eight folders - 'en-US', 'fr-FR', 'it-IT', 'ko-KR', 'ru-RU', 'sv-SE', 'zh-CN', and 'zh-TW' - that each contain the same set of four tutorial videos: 'Introducing Seagate Backup Plus', 'Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial', 'Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial', and 'Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial'. These eight sets of videos are identical in the video and audio, and only differ in the subtitle language used: English (no subtitles), French, Italian, Korean, Russian, Swedish, Chinese, and Taiwanese. If you keep the 'en-US' English video that has no subtitles and delete the other seven folders, you free up almost 350 MB of space.Of the three components in the Seagate Dashboard software, the ""Protect"" function offers the most usefulness and flexibility, while the ""Share"" and ""Save"" functions for sharing/uploading to and saving from social media sites are limited in their capabilities. With the Dashboard's ""Protect"" function, you can schedule backups of your files based on a regular hourly/daily/weekly/monthly schedule, or have your files backed up whenever they are added or modified, or make backups on an as-needed basis by manually initiating a ""snapshot"" backup of your files. I am always surprised by how many people never back up the files on their computers, either their work-related files or their personal files, including documents, email and Microsoft Outlook files, photo/music/media files, or other files that are often irreplaceable if their computer's hard drive suddenly fails. If your computer has years of files accumulated on it that you have never backed up to another disk, to a CD/DVD, or to an online cloud-based backup service, this Seagate Slim hard drive can be used as your backup device where you can store a duplicate copy of all your important files. If you have already been using a backup process, as mentioned, you do not have to install the Dashboard software and you can just completely delete all the pre-loaded software from this hard drive if you want.Important Note About Backup Software In General: If you do use the pre-loaded Seagate ""Protect"" software to back up your files, or if you use other kinds of automated backup software, you should randomly spot-check some of the duplicated backup files and folders every one or two months to verify that the files are correctly being copied and that they can be read correctly. Spot-check the backup files more frequently if they are important and you really value their integrity. Backup software is still a software application and, just like firmware and other software, and also taking into account that a hard drive may start to slowly fail with read/write errors after years of usage, there may be a software or hardware glitch that causes a file to either not be backed up by the backup software, or to be backed up but unreadable. By occasionally spot-checking the integrity of your backup files, you reduce the possibility of having an unpleasant surprise if you really need to recover the files from the backup copy. A data error can happen with any electronic storage media. For example, if you back up files by burning data to a CD/DVD/Blu-ray disc, you should spot-check their integrity by accessing some of their files at least once a year. The same rule applies if your backup files are stored by a cloud-based backup/storage service. There are also integrity-checking software that will automatically verify the integrity of hard disks or optical media. I am an avid photographer, and with terabytes of hard disk space becoming more inexpensive each year, my favorite way to back up files is by manually copying files and folders to two separate hard drives in a ""manual RAID 1"" setup where I manually back up and mirror the photo and HD-video files onto two separate drives, instead of relying on backup software to perform the function. I previously used a dual-hard-drive RAID 1 storage unit, but I like being able to directly access either drive and I also do not like how RAID 1 simultaneously deletes files from both drives if I ever type or click too fast and have an ""oops"" accidental file deletion.Important Note About Using Seagate Dashboard For Backups: As stated in the User Guide for Seagate's Dashboard backup software, Dashboard will NOT backup and save the contents of the 'Windows' and 'Program Files' directories, any other system-related files, files stored on detachable USB drives, and hidden files. By default, unless you have explicitly saved your documents and email files in a different location, Microsoft Windows stores all of your personal user files in a folder like C:\Users\YourUserName. This folder location can be accessed, either via the Command Prompt or using the Windows environment variable %UserProfile%, so you can go to your user profile by entering `cd %UserProfile%` in a 'Command Prompt' window; this location is usually C:\Users\YourUserName. Inside your C:\Users\YourUserName folder, there are two important folders called ""Documents"" and ""AppData"" where your various data files, document/text/work files, and email files are stored. Seagate Dashboard will not backup files and folders in your C:\Users\YourUserName if they have the ""Hidden"" attribute turned on. If you want hidden files in these two folders to be backed up, perform these steps:(1) Either from the Windows/File Explorer options or by searching for ""folder"" from the Control Panel, access the 'Folder Options' and turn on the 'Show hidden files and folders' option.(2) Open up Windows Explorer or File Explorer.(3) Right-click on both the ""Documents"" and ""AppData"" folders in your C:\Users\YourUserName folder and select ""Properties"".(4) On the Properties pop-up window, uncheck the 'Hidden' Attribute box, click [Apply], and also select the option to apply the action to all subfolders and files.(5) View the ""Properties"" for other folders and files stored in other locations to see if their 'Hidden' Attribute is checked and repeat this same procedure for those hidden folders/files that you wish to back up.Versions of Microsoft Outlook prior to Outlook 2010 store your PST email files in: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\ and your ""AppData"" folder will need to have its 'Hidden' Attribute unset for those email files to be backed up. Later versions of Outlook store PST files in C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\Outlook Files\, which is typically not hidden and will be backed up.The Dashboard software's ""Share"" function lets you share files that are stored on the hard drive by uploading to either Facebook, Flickr, or YouTube. And the ""Save"" function lets you save photos from Facebook or Flickr. Unlike the ""Share"" function, ""Save"" does not let you save videos from YouTube. But there are many freeware software and online sites that can convert and save YouTube videos already. I really did not care for how either these ""Share"" or ""Save"" functions worked because they are quite limited in their flexibility, and it is very easy to perform the same functions directly using the Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube sites without having to go through an intermediate step of using the Dashboard software to upload files. Perhaps Seagate added the ""Share"" and ""Save"" options for computer newbies or social media newcomers. But the irony is that even though this Dashboard software ""dumbs down"" the uploading of files to Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube, the computer newbies who would most benefit from using the ""Share"" and ""Save"" options may not even have an account on Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.This pocket-sized drive is quite small and light: 4.5""x3.0""x0.4"" and 5.3 ounces (including the USB cable) for the 500-GB version, with the 1-TB and 2-TB versions being slightly thicker and heavier. You can use this portable drive to shuttle files back and forth between Windows and Mac computers, dragging and dropping folders and files to transfer them between the computer and this external hard drive. Note that there are two versions of this Seagate Slim external hard drive: a Windows version formatted for NTFS and a Mac version formatted for HFS+. You should get the version for the platform that you work on the most. If you mainly use a Mac and you use Time Machine for your backups, you should definitely get the Mac version of this drive. If you mainly work on Windows and Mac is more of a secondary computer, you should get the Windows version of this drive.Since Windows NTFS and Mac HFS+ file systems do not automatically play well together, use of this hard drive on both Windows and Mac computers does require the download and installation of a driver. If you get the Windows version of this drive, when you plug the drive into a Mac, it will download from the Internet a necessary Mac driver (NTFS_for_Mac_with_restart.dmg) that lets the Windows-NTFS-formatted drive work with Macs. NTFS drives are normally read-only on Mac OS, and this driver lets Macs both read and write on the NTFS-formatted version of this hard drive. Note that because Mac's Time Machine requires a Mac-HFS-formatted drive, when you use the Windows version of this drive with the Mac driver, this setup cannot work with Time Machine unless you reformat the drive to be a HFS+journaled file system... in which case you might as well just get the Mac version of this drive if you intend to also use it with Time Machine. If you get the Mac version of this drive, when you plug the drive into a Windows PC, it will download a necessary Windows driver (HFS4Win.exe) that lets the Mac-HFS+formatted drive work with Windows. You can also download both the Mac-driver-for-Windows-NTFS and Windows-driver-for-Mac-HFS+ drivers directly from Seagate's Web site. See the 'Comments' section of my review for the URL locations. Seagate should have pre-loaded both of these Windows/Mac drivers on the hard drive just like how they pre-loaded both the Windows and Mac versions of their Dashboard software.Overall, this is a great little drive that is sized for maximum portability. It includes a 2-year limited warranty. And at the time of this review's writing, Amazon is offering this hard drive at a great price of less than $70 for the 500-GB size. It was not that long ago when a 500-GB portable hard drive costed hundreds of dollars and was at least three times larger in size.If my review helped you to make an informed buying decision, please click the [Yes] button below.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!Being a huge fan of Delerium, I would rate most of Delerium's earlier and later works five stars.  I have bought all of their albums, EPs, singles, and remixes over the years.  While their later post-1994 works accompanied by all of the sugar-coated female vocals would play well both on the radio and in dance clubs, I find that the earlier recordings on this ""Archives"" album hark back to the underground experimental electronica sounds of the 1980s.  The feel of most of the tracks on this 2-CD compilation reminds me of a combination of Dead Can Dance, and the experimental electronic instrumentals of Throbbing Gristle, Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel (aka Foetus Inc, aka Jim Thirlwell), and early pre-1983 Cabaret Voltaire (if you removed Stephen Mallinder's vocals and just left Richard H Kirk to play with his synthesizers).  Whether you call this music ""dark"" or ""ambient"" or ""gothic"", or whether you call it more ""experimental"" is a matter of semantics and personal interpretation.  But I like it... and I never associated myself as a goth rocker even though I do like The Cure, Bauhaus, and others from the '80s.  But if you have been listening to Delerium's later releases like ""Poem"", ""Chimera"", ""Nuages du Monde"", and ""Music Box Opera"", and you wanted to look into Delerium's earlier music with the expectation or hope that these ""Archives"" are similar to their later works with all of the guest female vocals and lush instrumentation, this may not appeal to you due to the total lack of vocals in all of these electronic instrumentals and much sparser arrangements of melodies.This 2-CD compilation covers Delerium's music from 1993 to 1994, selecting some of the best tracks from four albums and EPs released during those years.  Most of the music sound like quieter slowly evolving electronic space music with a mysterious or sinister feel to it, with a brooding ambient space music atmosphere.  The quieter tracks would feel right at home being used as the background soundtrack music for Sigourney Weaver's ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" movies, building up the tension earlier in the movie before chaos ensues as the alien monsters chase the humans in outer space.  I think of this music as ""night music"", best suited for either listening at home at night or listening while driving the car at night.  There is a related Delerium ""Archives 1"" 2-CD set, ""Archives, Vol. 1"", that covers Delerium's music from 1988 to 1992.  ""Archives 1"" is very similar to this ""Archives 2"" compilation, but has more tracks with an electronic tribal beat percussion to them.  Starting with their 1994 release of ""Semantic Spaces"", Delirium undergoes a tectonic shift in their musical style that considerably transforms their sound, adding female vocals with more layers of instrumentation, and permanently veering away from their ambient/space music beginnings in favor of a sound that has a much larger audience appeal.  I emphasize again that these ""Archives"" tracks are ambient space music with a dark mysterious feeling to them.  If you did not know that this was a Delerium album and you were only familiar with Delerium's later releases, you would think that this music was entirely performed by another artist.  If you keep an open mind to its dark textures, there are lots of ambiance and textures to be heard here.  But if you were hoping for the upbeat dance-oriented sounds of more recent Delerium albums, you will be disappointed by this ""Archives"" album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EBB1EDGCYJ24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005OAGA#wasThisHelpful","R3EBB1EDGCYJ24","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies. Positives: This laptop lift has a contemporary design to it, and its style is ideally suited for a modern office equipped with IKEA-styled furnishings. The elegantly curved rear of this lift acts as a laptop riser to keep the bottom of the laptop cool and optimize airflow underneath it. Negatives: The product photo for this Laptop Lift, both on the Amazon site and on the package box, suggests that you can type directly on your laptop while it is placed on this Laptop Lift, which is totally wrong and misleading. Any kind of laptop stand/lift/riser that pivots the rear of the laptop upward has terrible ergonomics if you type directly on the laptop's keyboard because pivoting your hands upward when typing puts a large amount of strain on your wrists. If the front edge of your laptop is relatively thin, the two rectangular tab bumpers that hold the front edge of the laptop in place stick up and rub against your wrists while you type, further adding to the terrible ergonomics of this design if you type directly on the laptop's keyboard. Some laptop risers and stands have adjustable angles or heights, but this Laptop Lift is not height-adjustable. This product is overpriced for being a simple piece of molded flexing plastic that is not very rigid and not height-adjustable.When I first looked at this product on Amazon, I thought that the curved base of this Fellowes I-Spire Laptop Lift was made of a metal grill because the Amazon product photos show what appear to be lots of vertical slits running along the base.  But this Laptop Lift is entire made of plastic.  The vertical slits are cut into the underside of the plastic base and serve as nothing more than a style accent.  The build quality of this Laptop Lift is not that rigid compared to other laptop stands and riser stands that are made of stiffer plastic or metal.The second thing that I noticed prior to actually receiving this product was that the photos provided by Fellowes on this Amazon product listing suggest directly typing on your laptop while it is placed on this Laptop Lift.  This same photo, showing the Laptop Lift being used in conjunction with other products in Fellowes I-Spire Series of office accessories, is also displayed on the box package for this Laptop Lift.  While all of these I-Spire products improve the ergonomics and comfort of working on a computer, the one glaring error in this setup is, ironically, the arrangement of the office chair and the laptop.  The office chair shown in the photo has unpadded non-adjustable armrests that are too low in height relative to the laptop's keyboard.  And even though Fellowes also offers an I-Spire Series Keyboard Wrist Rocker wrist rest, it is not displayed in the office setup in the photo and the implication and suggested usage is that the user would sit in the chair, nicely equipped with Fellowes lumbar cushion, and directly type on the laptop that is placed on this Laptop Lift.  While the photo of this office setup has a modern minimalist chic trendiness to it, no one would actually want to type for more than a few minutes on a laptop that is placed on this Laptop Lift because their wrists would become sore fairly soon.  This photo of an office equipped with all the Fellowes I-Spire accessories really should have shown an external keyboard being used with the laptop because this ""Laptop Lift"" is really just a ""laptop riser"" that is intended to be used with a separate USB or Bluetooth keyboard.  The main purpose of a laptop riser is to elevate the screen to reduce neck strain that can be caused by pivoting your neck downward too much while staring at the laptop screen.  When you are using a laptop at a desk, you can maximize the ergonomic comfort of your neck and wrists by positioning a separate keyboard so that your wrists are either level with the keyboard or slightly higher than the keyboard such that your wrists pivot downward slightly to type.  Never type on a keyboard that requires your wrists to pivot upward.  The laptop riser, or this Fellowes Laptop Lift, can then be used to raise the height of the laptop's screen for an optimum viewing angle and reduced neck strain.This Laptop Lift has a width of 13 1/8 inches, a depth of 9 1/4 inches, a front height (excluding the two 3/4-inch high bumper tabs mounted along the front edge) of 1/2 inch, and a rear height of 4 1/2 inches.  When the laptop is placed onto this Laptop Lift, the keyboard is pivoted at a 35-degree angle, which makes for uncomfortable ergonomics if you are typing directly onto the laptop's keyboard.  So this product is really not meant to be used by typing directly on the laptop's keyboard, nor is it designed to be placed on your lap like a lapdesk.Along with improving the viewing height of the laptop screen, the other advantage that most laptop risers offer is that they improve the airflow circulation underneath the laptop to keep it ventilated better.  Laptops vary in the design of their venting mechanisms.  Some laptops have fan intake ventilation holes/slots/openings on their bottom while other laptops (e.g. Apple MacBook and Lenovo laptops) mainly rely on openings along the top or sides to bring in or blow out air.  Dell and HP laptops have their fan intake openings located underneath the laptop and the warm air is then blown out from one side of the laptop.  When a laptop is placed flat on a desk or table, that impedes the airflow underneath the laptop where air is drawn into the fan intake openings on these laptops.  This Fellowes Laptop Lift is similar to many laptop riser designs in that it lets air flow underneath the laptop to improve cooling efficiency in laptops having their fan intakes located on the bottom. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:I rate this Fellowes Laptop Lift only 3 stars because if you search for ""laptop riser"" on Amazon, you will find dozens of similar products ranging in price between $12 and $40.  Some of the risers elevate the laptop screen, but they do not improve the airflow directly underneath the laptop.  But many of the laptop risers also let air flow underneath the laptop that it is supporting, along with offering other advantages that this Fellowes Laptop Lift does not have, including adjustable angle/height settings, better stability, a swivel stand, or integrated USB ports.  This Fellowes Laptop Lift can support a 17-inch laptop, but the plastic base flexes and feels flimsy.  So my 3-star rating reflects the fact that this Laptop Lift is fairly ""average"" when compared to all the other laptop riser options.  You can spend less money for a laptop riser that performs as well as this Laptop Lift, or for the same price or a few dollars more, you can get a laptop riser that has better build quality and more features.  In fact, for a few dollars more, Fellowes has another laptop riser, the ""Fellowes Professional Series Laptop Workstation with USB, Black (8024601)"", that is far more adjustable, with a far sturdier build quality made of metal, and it comes with a useful 4-port USB hub and document holder.  That ""Professional Series"" product, along with many other laptop risers, is a far better design than this basic plastic Laptop Lift, and they are all meant for use with an external keyboard and not for directly typing on the laptop's keyboard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13I2RYHHL3696/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXCDOH0#wasThisHelpful","R13I2RYHHL3696","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.I received a pair of these Anco ""Contour"" wiper blades for a Subaru Outback that frequently heads into the mountains during winter for skiing and snowshoeing outings.  Although the parameters for picking wiper blades are nowhere near as important as picking a good set of tires, there are a few parallel commonalities with respect to the kind of weather the wiper blades and tires are expected to handle; i.e. will the rubber on the wiper blades and tires be required to handle rain only or also handle winter snow and ice.  And some wiper blades have a more durable rubber for people who live in the hot desert Southwest.Installing two of these wipers was very easy and quick.  The blade just snaps on and a tab makes a clicking sound to lock it into place.  As a rain wiper, I think that this wiper works just as well as Bosch ICON and ACDelco blades, giving a clean streak-free wipe with no streaking or squeaking.  Living in a location where it snows in the winter, a wiper blade's performance and durability in wiping mud, slush, snow, and ice off the windshield in sub-freezing temperatures would be the other half of this review.  But, alas, the last snowflakes fell here about two months ago.These ""Contour"" blades are shaped with a spoiler that supposedly helps to provide better blade-to-windshield contact.  Although the Amazon ""Product Description"" says that this wiper's spoiler is ""unique"", many other brands of wiper blades (e.g. Bosch ""ICON"" and ACDelco ""Clear Vision"") also have a spoiler molded into their designs.Overall, this is a good-quality wiper.  But I rate this 4 stars because I do not think that they are extraordinary, but they are comparable to ACDelco ""Clear Vision"" wipers that I previously used, and I like the Bosch ICON wipers better (I would rate the Bosch ICON blades 4.5 or 5 stars, even though ICON blades cost more and take a little more time to install than these Anco blades).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQR8L27Y91N2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014YFBO6#wasThisHelpful","RQR8L27Y91N2X","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies! Positives: This printer can output superb gallery-quality prints with exceptional detail and resolution, while being significantly less expensive than the higher-end Pro-10 and Pro-1 printer models. This Pro-100 prints better blacks and grays on monochrome prints than the older Pro9000 printer that it replaces. The new wireless connectivity options of using 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi or Apple's AirPrint, along with a wired Ethernet option, provide flexibility of shared usage and printer placement by not needing to be physically connected to a USB cable. The dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years. Negatives: While black-and-white prints are better than the previous Pro9000 printer, monochrome output is still inferior to the pricier Pro-10 and Pro-1 printers.If you have never used a prosumer-level dedicated photo printer like this before, prepare to be surprised... both by the size and weight of this printer's box and by the stunning quality of color photos that you can print out, with exceptional detail and resolution even if you press your nose close to a 13""x19"" print.  Weighing a very hefty 56 pounds in its shipping box, the box that this printer is shipped in resembles a two-drawer file cabinet laying on its side (and it is heavier than most empty two-drawer file cabinets).  This printer was shipped to me in its original Canon box package; the big box was not placed inside another bigger Amazon box.Having previously used Canon's excellent PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II printer, this Pro-100 printer has a number of differences and improvements over that older model.  First of all, this Pro-100 is bigger in size and about 10 to 12 pounds heavier than the Pro9000.  Along with the USB 2.0 cable connection and Wireless PictBridge connection to Canon cameras that are also used in the older Pro9000 printer, this Pro-100 also adds wireless AirPrint printing from iPad/iPhone/iOS devices and, most significantly, both wireless 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet printing from your LAN.  While the ability to print directly and wirelessly from an iPad or Canon camera is useful, I think that for a professional-grade photo printer like this, most people will want to view, edit, adjust, and tweak their photos on their computer first before printing them, so being able to add this printer to my router's wireless LAN is a huge convenience, making it easy to both share the printer between different laptop and desktop computers on the LAN, and to have extra freedom in placing this large printer in an optimum location.While both the Pro9000 and this Pro-100 use eight ink cartridges, the Pro9000's black/cyan/photo-cyan/magenta/photo-magenta/yellow/red/green colors are now represented as black/gray/light-gray/cyan/photo-cyan/magenta/photo-magenta/yellow in this Pro-100, with three inks dedicated to blacks and grays instead of just the one black ink cartridge on the Pro9000, resulting in noticeably better black-and-white monochrome prints on this Pro-100 when compared to the Pro9000.The 10-cartridge Pro-10 printer also has three black/gray colors along with adding a red color back into the mix, while the 12-cartridge top-of-the-line Pro-1 dedicates five ink cartridges to black/gray colors.  If you mainly print a lot of black-and-white photos, you should seriously consider spending the extra money on the Pro-1.  While the Pro-1 has better overall color resolution than this Pro-100, one of the Pro-1's greatest strengths is in the range of blacks and grays that it can accurately print.  High-resolution monochrome prints are one of the toughest tests of photo printers since some inkjet printers leak a slight bit of color cast onto black-and-white prints while other inkjets do not offer enough grayscale resolution, and this Pro-100 is not consistently perfect with its black-and-white output and its printing of the deepest black regions.  While this Pro-100 prints better grays and blacks than what the Pro9000 prints, both Canon's Pro-1 and Epson's R3000 can print noticeably superior black-and-white prints when compared to this Pro-100 monochrome prints.  These are not glaring deficiencies in the print quality, but there are subtle differences in the accuracy and resolution of black and gray color gradations when you compare an image printed on this Pro-100 with the same image printed on the Pro-1.Although I have not precisely measured how long each ink cartridge lasts when printing the same photo each time, I have always believed that Epson's printers drink up their ink faster than either Canon or HP inkjet printers, and Epson ink cartridges seem to be more prone to clogging, both on Epson's photo printers and their printer/copier/fax multi-function printers.  On average, I get about 7 to 10 large 13""x19"" color prints from this Pro-100 before I have to replace some of the color ink cartridges.  This is comparable to the previous Pro9000 printer.  The more expensive Pro-1 uses ink cartridges that are almost three times larger in ink volume, and its colors are distributed across 12 ink cartridges versus the 8 cartridges used by this Pro-100.  So this Pro-100 needs more frequent ink replacements than the Pro-1 printer, although it uses up the ink at a rate that is comparable to the older Pro9000 printer.  But I seem to replace ink cartridges more frequently on Epson inkjet printers than on Canon printers.  As with ""razor blade marketing"", I think that all inkjet printer manufacturers earn the bulk of their printer hardware profits from the ink cartridge refills.  If you regularly print 11""x14"" or 13""x19"" prints with this Pro-100, at the current price of about $17 per ink cartridge, using up a set of all eight ink cartridges will cost you about $125 to $135 to replace all eight refills.When using a sophisticated photo printer like this to print 13""x19"" photos, you should likewise use a camera that is better than a $200 point-and-shoot camera.  This printer's output quality is ideally suited for photos shot using a better SLR camera.  And instead of printing photos directly from an iPad via AirPrint or directly from a Canon camera via PictBridge, you should carefully review and select your photos on the computer first, applying post-processing edits, aligning/straightening/cropping, sharpening, and other enhancements as needed.  As with the computer lingo of ""garbage in, garbage out"", if your photo is not sharp or if your camera's autofocus locked onto a tree that was behind the person you were photographing, this printer will expose those problems far more if you output a 13""x19"" print than what can be noticed on a 4""x6"" print.  I never print smaller than 8""X10"" prints using this Pro-100 printer, and I certainly do not print text documents on this Pro-100, because printing small 4""x6"" photos is both a waste of this printer's capabilities and is a waste of its beautiful pricey inks.  For printing 4""x6"" photos that I share with other people, using a less fancy inkjet photo printer or a printer/copier/fax multi-function inkjet printer suits me just fine.  I only use this Pro-100 for printing photos that will be framed, and my favorite sizes have been 8""x10"", 11""x14"", and 13""x19"".  Once I became addicted to printing beautifully colored and richly detailed 13""x19"" photos from this Pro-100, it is hard for me to go smaller than 8""x10"" now :-)Since you will likely be editing and adjusting your photos from your computer prior to printing them on this Pro-100, you should invest in some color calibration hardware if you are not already calibrating your monitor and printer.  So along with spending money on ink refills, expect to pay at least several hundred dollars for calibration hardware.  If you edit your photos on your computer, viewing them on an uncalibrated laptop/display screen, and then send the images to this printer, the coloration of the resulting prints may be different from the images that you were looking at on the screen.  Datacolor and X-Rite both make excellent color calibration tools.  Both the Datacolor Spyder Studio S4SSR100 and X-Rite CMUNPH ColorMunki Photo are great for ensuring that the display screens, printer, printer ink, and printer paper that you use are all calibrated together so you get exacting control over the how the image will look in going from your computer onto the printed page.  Although I have both Spyder and ColorMunki calibration tools, I prefer Datacolor's Spyder more than X-Rite's ColorMunki.  X-Rite's hardware, overall, is faster than Datacolor's hardware, but I think that Datacolor's software is far better than X-Rite's software with respect to software features, quality, and stability.If you are thinking: ""Whoa, this display and printer calibration gear can cost more than a new Pro-100!  I just want to print my photos the way that my camera captured them!"", you can still usually get excellent print results without calibration by using Canon inks and Canon papers with this printer.  You can also get a visual feel for how light/dark/red/green/blue/yellow your images appear on the screen when compared to how they print out by holding a large print next to your monitor displaying the same image.  Some people adjust color hues and temperatures by visually comparing printed output to the screen display, using a combination of soft-proofing and hardcopy proofing.  This is combined with using the paper profiles supplied by Canon or the manufacturer of the printer paper you are using.  While that approach helps to prevent too much discrepancy between what is displayed on screen and what is printed, it is also fraught with potential human error and variations as you switch papers and inks, as your monitor ages and shifts in its color response, and as the brightness and subtle hues of the ambient room lighting change in between each visual screen-to-print comparison.  In addition, an image on a monitor projects additive colors through its pixels, whereas an image on a print is subtractive in that it absorbs and reflects ambient light, and this can significantly alter your visual comparison of hues and contrast when comparing the same image between display and print.If you are a graphic artist or you want to control the colors/hues/saturation/brightness in Photoshop, calibrating your display screen to produce custom monitor profiles and calibrating the printer to get a custom ICC printer profile is the best way to ensure that what you see on screen is what you end up printing.  Only by generating a custom printer profile can you accurately connect the dots between your display, your printer (which can also have variations in print output even between two printers of the same model), your ink, and your paper.  Because a display monitor's color response slowly shifts as it ages, you should calibrate a newer display every one or two months and calibrate an older display every two weeks.  As anyone who has ever painted the inside of a house realizes, each gallon can or custom-mix of a specific paint color can have slight variations that make it visibly different in between batches.  The same variation can happen in between batches of printer paper and ink cartridges made by the same manufacturer.  So to take into account these variations in printer-ink-paper combinations, you should generate a new custom printer profile every time that you switch to a new package of paper and every time that you replace ink cartridges.Also introduced in this Pro-100 is a new ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in that provides a printer interface to Photoshop CS/Elements/Lightroom and Canon's own Digital Photo Professional (version 2.1 or later).  If you are printing from either Adobe's or Canon's software, this plug-in lets you adjust printer settings, manage color settings (e.g. via an ICC profile), etc.  If you mainly just change some common print options using the standard Microsoft Windows printer pop-up windows, the large number of options available in this ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in may be a bit bewildering.  After all, both this printer and the ""Print Studio Pro"" plug-in are targeted towards professional-level photographers.  Luckily, most of the default settings in this plug-in provide for a good starting point.  But for people who are accustomed to tweaking specific color profiles and printer profiles, these available adjustments should be reasonably easy to set up and the options are nicely grouped together in logical functionally related layouts.Other software packaged with this printer include a ""Easy Photo Print"" and an image filters application that lets you apply basic special effects to your photos, along with tools to print onto CDs and CD/DVD case covers.  This printer includes a tray to hold a CD or DVD so you can use this printer, along with the included ""Easy Photo Print"" software, to easily print professional-looking disc labels.  The color labels that are directly printed onto the CD/DVD may have the inks smear and smudge if they get wet, unless you use a water-resistant disc like Taiyo Yuden/JVC WaterShield (in fact, *all* of Taiyo Yuden/JVC CD and DVD media are excellent in general).Upon opening this printer's large shipping box, I was able to fully set up this printer for wireless Wi-Fi printing, including installation of all software, after a little over one hour's time.  All of the contents inside the shipping box were neatly packed together with lots of tape holding various parts and pieces in place.  This printer has impeccable build quality, with an excellent fit and finish, and it is a very solid piece of equipment.  Any large-format photo printer like this will not be compact in size, and this Pro-100's size of 27.2""x8.6""x15.2"" (Width-Height-Depth) needs extra room on a desk or table.  In particular, the 27-inch width is wider than many large-format photo printers that can output 13""x19"" prints.  And Canon's Pro-1 is still even larger in size.  I have my Pro-100 placed sideways on top of a two-drawer file cabinet.After installing the included software, you should go to Canon's Web site to check if there are updated versions of firmware, drivers, and software.  This really applies to any kind of software that you install; periodically check for new updates or patches that can be downloaded from the software company's Web site, first verifying that the updates are newer than what you have installed and that the updates apply to your specific setup.  Whenever I install new software, I immediately check for new software, firmware, or driver updates or patches before I begin to use the software.  Some software updates are major and can overwrite or reset any changes that you have configured in the software, so it is best to download and apply all new updates before proceeding to use the software.  As with the software and firmware for their cameras, Canon frequently releases updates that may include bug fixes or extra features.  For example, there are Pro-100 software updates on Canon's Web site that add support for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 along with support for more paper types.Connecting this printer using the supplied USB cable is the easiest setup method.  My iPad also easily detected this printer's AirPrint capability.  The included software guides you through either the USB or network connection menus.  To initiate the connection to the printer, you press and hold down the [Resume/Cancel] button and then let it flash 6 times for a wireless WPS connection or let it flash 11 times for a wired USB connection.  This printer connection setup process is quite cumbersome, but its wireless printing is very reliable once it has been configured.  Canon needs to make the setup software and connection configuration easier and quicker to use.  If your wireless access point or router is not able to connect to this printer using the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) mode, a more reliable approach is to choose the ""Wireless Setup Using the USB cable"" connection method that Canon's software also offers as a setup option.  If you do encounter problems during setup of the printer or configuration of the printer's network connection, you can phone Canon's customer service at 1-800-OK-CANON (1-800-652-2666) Monday through Friday 10:00AM to 10:00PM EST, and you can talk to their knowledgeable staff who have good English skills.The print quality of this printer is excellent, even when compared to other dedicated photo printers.  A dye-based printer like this will naturally produce better color saturation than a pigment-based printer such as Canon's Pro-1 or Pro-10, or Epson's R3000.  But a pigment-based printer will usually produce deeper blacks and dark tones.  This Pro-100 is an excellent printer especially for landscape and nature photography because the colors are very rich and saturated.  However, when printing portraits, skin tones can sometimes appear a bit ruddy or suntanned.  I think that this is more due to the natural characteristics of dye inks, and not an issue with the color accuracy of the printer itself.  The printer is not changing the hues of the skin by adding too much red color, but the existing flesh tones, and all colors in general, may be slightly more saturated than what is depicted in the actual images when using a dye-based inkjet printer.  Slightly oversaturated skin colors in people are more noticeable than extra saturation of colors in animals, objects, landscapes, and nature scenery.  In fact, if you show people two landscape/nature/floral photos where one photo accurately depicts all colors and the other photo shows the same scene but with more color saturation, most people will prefer the more colorful saturated photo than the photo with accurate colors.  But the ""more colorful is better"" preference does not apply to extra saturation of skin colors.  By slightly toning down the saturation of my photos that contain people in them prior to printing, I can get more natural skin tones on my prints from this Pro-100.  For printing portraits and photos that include people in them, I reduce the saturation of the skin areas by about 5% to 10%.  But for printing landscape and nature photos, the rich coloration is quite appealing, so I usually do not reduce the saturation levels on most of my landscape and floral images.  For a photo of people surrounded by colorful scenery, I often slightly decrease the saturation just on the skin areas while letting the surrounding background stay the same.  For photos that I have processed through HDR, which are usually a bit more saturated, I may reduce saturation by 5% or as much as 10% prior to printing them on this Pro-100.  And most of my HDR-processed photos are far less saturated than many people's HDR processing since I prefer more natural and realistic-looking HDR-processed images instead of the wildly colored HDR images of some people that I think are tiresome to look at.  If you normally post-process your photos to have extra color saturation, keep in mind that a dye-based printer like this Pro-100 will slightly bump up the saturation even more when compared to a pigment-based printer. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Dye-based inks previously were not as colorfast as pigment-based inks over the long term.  But the technology has improved so the dye-based inks used in this Pro-100 can retain their colors for 100+ years.  You can expect excellent results for both image quality and color longevity if you use Canon's Pro Platinum, Luster, or Premium Photo Gloss or Semi-Gloss papers with this Pro-100 printer.  Dye-based inks do not perform as well on porous matte photo papers and other uncoated fine art papers.  If that is your preferred printer paper, instead of using a semi-gloss or gloss paper, then a pigment-based ink printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1 may be better suited for your photo paper preferences.  The longevity of all printed photos depends upon various factors such as whether the photo is protected in a frame or photo album (longer life) or is frequently handled (shorter life), whether the photo is framed (shorter life) or stored inside a photo album (longer life), and whether the framed photo is exposed to bright light (more fading) or displayed more in the shade (less fading).  Dye inks are absorbed into the paper, whereas pigment inks stick to the surface as small pigment particles that are not absorbed into the paper.  Using a t-shirt analogy, dye printer inks are like a t-shirt design that has dyes soaked into the cotton while pigment printer inks are like a t-shirt design that uses an iron-on applique.  Because of this, pigment inks are more easily damaged due to scratches, chipping, or flaking, whereas a dye ink photo can be framed or mounted without glass covering it and it will be more resistant to mechanical damage.  However, if a dye-printed page is exposed to water or high humidity, since dye inks easily dissolve in water, the dye ink photo can smear, bleed, or fade, whereas pigment inks are more resistant to water because they stick tighter to the surface of the page and will bleed less if exposed to moisture.  The appearance of dye-ink prints can be affected by the texture of the paper being used, taking on some of the characteristics of the paper, whereas pigment-based prints look more consistent across all kinds of printer paper.  Dye-based inks previously could produce a much wider color gamut than pigment-based inks.  But just as dye inks have caught up to the colorfast longevity of pigment inks, pigment inks have now caught up to the wide color gamut that was previously an exclusive advantage of dye inks.Overall, the detail, resolution, and color accuracy of this Pro-100 are superb, worthy of gallery displays and at least as good as, or better than, prints that you order from a drug store or retail department store.  I print a lot of 11""x14"" and 13""x19"" photos of my nature, landscape, and macro photography that I frame, give as gifts, and hang on walls around my house, and visitors are often surprised that I printed these photos at home instead of using a commercial service.  With a simple black frame and a white wall background, each large print looks glorious with its rich colors and fine detail.  From a cost perspective, if you also take into account the cost of display and printer calibration hardware and replacing expensive ink cartridges, using this Pro-100 to get professional lab-quality large-format prints may not be much cheaper than paying a high-quality commercial photo lab.  But printing at home does offer a more immediate and convenient printing of photos and, if you calibrate both your display and printer, you can have more precise control over how your prints will look with the specific papers you are using.  Even if you do decide to send most of your images to commercial photo labs for printing, calibrating your monitor will assure that the colors you are viewing and editing are accurately displayed.  So if color accuracy is important to you, monitor calibration is a must.As mentioned, if you want incrementally better color accuracy and resolution and better black-and-white prints that compare favorably to the high-end prints offered by photo labs, you have to step up to the Pro-10 or Pro-1 printers.  But those two printers cost two to three times more than this Pro-100, so this Pro-100 may be totally sufficient for most amateur photographers unless, again, most of your photography is black-and-white, in which case I would recommend the Pro-1.  If most of your photography involves portraits and weddings, you may also want to consider the Pro-10 or Pro-1 because their pigment-based inks produce slightly more natural-looking skin tones, unless you sometimes slightly reduce the saturation on the skin areas prior to printing on this Pro-100, or you can also create custom profiles by calibrating this printer's output along with the display monitor and printer paper being used.  I should emphasize that the slightly deeper saturation of colors on this dye-based inkjet printer is not very noticeable on the skin colors of all photos that I print out, but the subtle differences are more noticeable if I compare an image showing close-ups of faces printed on this Pro-100 and place the Pro-100 print right next to the same image printed on Canon's Pro-1 pigment-based inkjet printer.  And you may actually prefer the slightly richer skin tones printed by the Pro-100 when compared to a pigment-based printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1.  Dye-based printers just have a slightly different look and feel than pigment-based printers.  Other than those two caveats, the quality of the photo prints from this Pro-100 should satisfy all but the most discerning amateur photographers.  I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions.  I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH93Q4O1NDUXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095F5BCS#wasThisHelpful","RH93Q4O1NDUXG","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies, with some reservations. Positives: This kettle quickly boils a fully-loaded 40 ounces of water within 4 minutes. The interior of the kettle is one-piece metal liner, with no separate parts, seams, or plastic pieces immersed inside the boiling water. Unlike electric kettles that are shaped like the old-fashioned stove-top whistling kettles, the cylindrical shape of this kettle's interior and its wide-open mouth make it very easy to clean. As with many modern electric kettle designs, this one also easily plugs in by simply setting the kettle onto its plugged-in base; the kettle itself has no electric cord. Negatives: Even though the kettle's interior is entirely metal and does not have plastic parts being immersed in boiling water, the lid has a lot of plastic on its underside. A C-shaped one-inch band of rust spots form on the interior base of this kettle after several months of usage.For the longest time, I had been using a stove-top whistling kettle.  My main requirements for an electric kettle are: 1) fast heating of water (and nothing but water) for my tea or French press coffee maker (having a variable temperature control does not matter to me), 2) a durable leak-proof stainless steel construction, and 3) a minimum amount of plastic used inside the kettle.  I tend to eschew the use of plastics, non-stick coatings, and other synthetic ingredients on the interior of any food cooking/processing appliances, cookware, cups, mugs, or food serving or storage containers, especially if it involves hot food or drink.  For this reason, I also did not care to have a see-through water level built into a stainless steel kettle since these involve plastics coming into contact with my water.More of the Cool-Touch Kettle's features are described and rated below: Excellent 5-fuzzies feature ratings: This is an affordable electric kettle with great one-piece stainless steel construction quality.  There are no seams on the interior that can act as a potential source of leakage or exposure to welding.  The kettle is cordless and is easily placed on its power base from any direction.  The handle is very comfortable to hold.  The photo that is currently displayed on Amazon shows the kettle photographed from above, which gives it a slimmer look, and I initially wondered if the kettle would be prone to tipping compared to other kettles that are more squat in shape.  But when I received it, I realized that the kettle's upright shape is quite stable. Good 4-fuzzies feature ratings: The kettle heats fairly quickly water to a rolling boil within 4 minutes.  Its boiling time is comparable to most electric kettles on the market right now.  Of course, variations in boiling times may be due to the ambient room and water temperature. The ""Cool-Touch"" name is quite a misleading misnomer since this kettle is more of a ""Very-Warm-Touch"" or ""Not-Searing-Hot-Touch"" feel to bare hands by the time that the water boils four minutes after it is turned on.  Even though this is a double-wall stainless steel kettle, it is not truly a double-wall vacuum-insulated design, which would have really made the exterior cool to touch.  But it does not burn your skin like other stainless steel or glass kettles filled with boiling water. Not-so-good 3-fuzzies feature ratings: I searched all over the place to find an electric kettle that minimized the use of plastics in the interior areas where my water is being boiled.  This kettle has less than one inch of exposed plastic on its interior compartment, and that plastic is located well above the water near the top of the kettle.  HOWEVER, Hamilton Beach missed the opportunity to create a plastic-free design by adding a big chunk of plastic on the underside of the lid.  And you have to keep the lid on in order for the auto-shutoff mechanism to work.  The kettle's manual states: ""If lid is not in place, auto-shutoff will not operate"".  But if all that plastic underneath the supplied lid bugs you, as it also bugs me, you can remove the lid and cap it with some other stainless steel, Pyrex, or oven-safe lid or saucer.  The top rim of the kettle is about 5.5 inches wide in diameter.  So if you can find a 6-inch or 7-inch round saucer or cookware lid, you can use that as a plastic-free kettle lid. When I first received this kettle, snapped its lid into place, and properly covered the kettle with its lid during operation, the automatic shutoff switch never worked for me.  NEVER.  Not even once.  I suspect that some of this may be due to the high altitudes where I am using this kettle.  I have only used this kettle at elevations between about 6000 feet and 9000 feet. Water boils at 212-F degrees at sea level.  But at 6000 feet, due to the thinner air and lower atmospheric pressure, water boils quicker at a 34-degree cooler temperature of 178-F.  And if I boil water at 8000 feet, water boils even sooner at a temperature of 168-F degrees.  During the first week of usage, I boiled water in this kettle more than a dozen times, using it in the way it was intended, with its supplied lid fully in place covering the top, and its auto-shutoff never worked, regardless of how long I keep the water in a vigorously rolling boil.  But this was not a huge issue for me; during the four minutes that the kettle needed to boil the water, I would be in the kitchen preparing my French press or tea and it was easy to listen for the sounds of when the water was boiling and I would manually turn off the kettle.  And as far as I am concerned, because there is so much plastic being used on the underside of the lid, I would rather remove the lid and not use it anyway.  The lid snaps into place on top of the kettle and when I open the lid, it swings vertically in the middle of the kettle, and I find that the lid gets in the way of the water being poured into the kettle.  So by not using the supplied lid at all, I remove the main chunk of plastic that comes in contact with the hot water or steam, and it becomes far easier to pour water into the kettle.I now cover the top of my kettle with an old Corning ""Amber Vision"" see-through glass saucepan.  Not only did replacing the supplied plastic-lined lid with a saucepan let me peek inside the kettle during operation, but I serendipitously found out that now my kettle's auto-shutoff consistently and reliably works when using the saucepan instead of the supplied lid as a cover!  The auto-shutoff NEVER worked when I used the supplied lid.  Go figure!  I do not know exactly why the auto-shutoff would never work using the kettle's lid but now consistently works when I cover the top with the saucepan.  But when using the supplied lid, there is a larger opening where the pour spout is, whereas if I cover the top with the saucepan, there is only a very small crack of an opening around the rim where the heat and steam can escape.  So I suspect that my saucepan lid trick now causes the auto-shutoff to always work because the auto-shutoff senses steam pressure and/or temperature, and thus by covering the top opening more completely, I create a higher build-up of temperature and steam pressure?  Near the top of the kettle where the top of its handle goes inside the kettle, there is a half-inch opening.  This opening is used by the kettle's auto-shutoff sensor (located somewhere inside the kettle) to determine when the water is hot enough to turn off the kettle.  I think that this kettle's temperature-sensitive cutoff switch is badly designed, with either too high of a shutoff temperature or too slow of a response rate, to be reliably depended upon, especially at high altitudes.  If your kettle's auto-shutoff is not always working, try removing the lid and capping the top with a saucepan or saucer that completely covers the opening.  This may still not fix your auto-shutoff problem.  But it permanently fixed my kettle's problem of never shutting off by itself.By covering the top of the kettle using a see-through glass saucepan, my kettle setup now has one of the tiniest amounts of plastic exposed to either water or steam.  I could find no other electric kettle on the market right now, stainless steel or glass, that was totally plastic-free and did not use plastic in its interior, see-through water level, or lid.  The advantage of using either a cookware lid or small saucepan instead of a saucer to cover the kettle is that there is a handle to hold onto when removing the cover, whereas you would have to handle the hot saucer dish if it was used to cover the kettle.  Without using the supplied lid though, when you pour the hot water from the kettle, you should hold the kettle lower down on its handle to distance your hand from the steam that now flows freely from the totally open kettle. The box that the kettle is shipped in advertises it as having ""8 Cup/1.2 Liter Capacity"".  This is thoroughly misleading!  For one thing, 1.2 liters equates to about 5 cups (U.S. or metric).  Amazon also lists this as a ""8 Cup Electric Kettle"", even though the 'Product Features' section lists it as ""40-ounce electric kettle"", which is the correct 5-cup capacity that this kettle can hold if you fill it to the ""MAX"" line that is molded on the interior of the kettle.  This 5-cup capacity may be an issue for you if you need a larger capacity kettle.  But since I mainly use this kettle for tea and, especially, to fill my 35-ounce Frieling USA Ultimo Stainless-Steel French Press, 35-ounce, this kettle's volume works perfectly for me.  In fact, for use with the Frieling French press, which is also double-walled stainless steel, I need to fill the water slightly below the ""MAX"" line on this kettle to allow room for the movement of the plunger inside the filled French press. After several months of usage, the interior base of this kettle developed a C-shaped band of rust spots.  This band of rust spots is about one inch in width, starting from the other perimeter of the base and extending inward about one inch.  It is C-shaped because the band of rust spots goes around two-thirds of the kettle's circumference, with the ""C"" shape centered at the kettle's pour spout, while the remaining one-third perimeter of the base that is near the handle is rust-free.  These are definitely rust spots and not mineral deposits or algae.  I always completely transfer the boiled water from the kettle and I never leave water sitting inside this kettle, so algae or deposits cannot form on the metal.  The spots also cannot be scrubbed off.  While I think that most of this kettle's interior is stainless steel, the inner base of this kettle is most likely some other mix of metal other than stainless steel.  As the water heats up, the bubbles also initially begin to form where the C-shaped pattern of rust spots are, so I suspect that the rust is forming where the heating elements are located inside this kettle.  After more than one year later, these rust spots still remain confined to the C-shaped band circling around two-thirds of the base's perimeter, so while most of this kettle's interior is stainless steel, I think that the C-shaped heating area on this kettle's base was purposely designed to not be stainless steel to facilitate a faster transfer of heat to the water inside the kettle. The kettle's pour spout is designed as way too much of a subtle indentation in the metal.  The spout would be far more usable if it had more of a pronounced U-shape flare in the metal.  The first few times that I poured from this kettle, I either had some hot water drip onto the counter or run down the side of the kettle.  But I found out that I could not pour either too quickly or too slowly.  Now, with the correct amount of finesse in wrist action, I can neatly filled my French press without dripping on the counter.  But this kettle's spout could have been made easier to pour from if it was shaped more like a spout.  This spout is okay for pouring your boiled water into the wide opening of a French press.  But if you try to pour a precise amount of boiled water into a small teacup or try to pour into the narrow opening of a Thermos bottle, good luck! Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Overall, this is a great kettle that I rate as 4 stars!  I would have gave it a 5-star rating if it did not have the following 4 issues that bug me:1) The kettle could have been constructed using far less plastic by using a lid that was entirely stainless steel (but then again, I could find NO other electric kettle that was plastic-free, and this kettle comes closest to being a plastic-free design, especially when I cover its top with my glass saucepan).2) The auto-shutoff is not totally reliable (but then again, I have read these complaints on other makes and models of electric kettles too, and I fixed my kettle's auto-shutoff by replacing its lid with a saucepan cover).3) If this was truly entirely stainless steel on this kettle's interior, it would not develop rust spots around the inside of its base.4) The kettle's pour spout needs to be shaped more like a spout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKWQ4PH7R7BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JCKG4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3DKWQ4PH7R7BH","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies (but buy the MX922 instead if you find it at a great discounted price) Positives: The quality of text and graphics on Word/Excel printouts is excellent. The quality of photo prints are good when compared to most all-in-one multi-function printers. This printer has a multitude of flexible connection options: USB 2.0, Wireless Wi-Fi LAN, Wired Ethernet LAN, Wireless PictBridge connection to Canon cameras, Bluetooth from a mobile phone (using an optional Bluetooth adapter), AirPrint printing from iPad/iPhone/iOS devices, Google Cloud Print from Gmail/GoogleDocs/GoogleChrome. The two black/color ink cartridges can be conveniently replaced from a front-facing panel, instead of having to lift up the entire scanner lid to access them. The printer can print in full duplex mode, automatically printing to both sides of the paper. Negatives: Print speed is a bit on the slow side compared to many other multi-function printers, but its print quality is better than most. While this is an excellent printer for home or home office use, its slower speed and limited 100-sheet paper capacity would not be a good choice for a busy small office. The single color ink cartridge contains all three cyan/magenta/yellow colors, so each color cannot be separately replaced.This Canon MX522 is a multi-function printer that can print and fax from a PC, wirelessly print via AirPrint from iPad/iPhone/iOS devices, print from a Web service such as Google Cloud Print, and it can also work as a standalone color copier and fax machine.  Its multi-functional appeal is not just limited to its outputs, but it is likewise very flexible with its connection inputs.Setup was easy and quick.  The print speed of this MX522 is its main weakness.  Whether printing Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or photos, it prints about %40 to %60 slower than a comparably priced Epson WorkForce multi-function printer.  However, the quality of the print from this MX522 on Word documents and Excel spreadsheets is better than the Epson.  Upon close examination, the text and graphics on my Word and Excel printouts have an excellent, clear, crisp look to them, better than the Epson.  So perhaps this Canon takes it time printing so that it emphasizes quality over quantity.  Fair enough...  While the print quality of text on documents is noticeably better on this MX522 when compared to a similar Epson WorkForce printer, the print quality of photos was fairly average, i.e. not good, not bad, and either comparable to, or slightly better than, other multi-function printers.This printer uses two ink cartridges, a black cartridge (PG-240, PG-240XL, PG-240XXL) and a cyan/magenta/yellow three-color cartridge (CL-241, CL-241XL).  Depending upon their pricing, the larger ""XL"" cartridges are often a better deal than the non-XL cartridges.  While replacing a single three-color ink cartridge is more convenient than replacing three separately-colored ink cartridges, I really would have preferred that this printer used three separate cyan, magenta, and yellow ink cartridges in addition to the black color.  Regardless of whether I am printing photos or documents containing graphics, the colors are never used up at the same rate.  So if I have used up all of the cyan color, I have to replace the color cartridge even though the magenta and yellow inks are likely not empty and still usable.  By comparison, Epson's WorkForce printers do use four separate cyan/magenta/yellow/black ink cartridges.  But as with ""razor blade marketing"", I think that all inkjet printer manufacturers earn the bulk of their printer hardware profits from the ink cartridges.  Compared to many multi-function printers where you have to lift up a bulky scanner lid in order to access and replace the ink cartridges, the two ink cartridges in this MX522 are easily replaced by accessing a small door located at the front right corner of this printer.Some all-in-one printers do not offer automatic duplexer.  But this MX522 has full duplex capability so I can automatically print to both sides of a sheet without needing to manually insert a printed page back into the printer to print the other side.  On printers that have a duplexer, I use this feature a lot since it also saves on paper, especially if I am printing a 70-page document.This printer includes ""My Image Garden"" software that lets you manage, organize, and edit your photos.  Its photo editing and image enhancement functions are weak and limited when compared to Photoshop Elements or PaintShop Pro, but it is very easy to use for the photo-editing novice, and it can do some pretty nifty things such as capture frames from a MOV/MP4 video, or create cards or calendars to print out.One nitpick that I have is that even though you can connect this printer using its USB 2.0 port, a USB cable is not provided in the box.  So if you want to connect this printer using USB, you have to provide your own cable.  But the wireless Wi-Fi printing works so well that you should choose this as the main connection. Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:This MX522 printer is the middle model of Canon's line of three MX scanner/copier/fax multi-function printers.  At the time of this review's writing, the better Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax MX922 printer is only selling for $15 to $20 more than this MX522.  Amazon prices may fluctuate daily, but the $15 to $20 price difference has been going on for a long time now.  If you can get a great price deal on the MX922 printer, I would definitely recommend the MX922 printer instead because its print speed is about twice as fast as this MX522, its photo/graphics/text print quality is better, it uses separate color ink cartridges instead of this MX522's wasteful approach of combining all colors into a single cartridge, and it has far better paper handling capabilities.  So while I rate this MX522 4 stars, I would rate the MX922 5 stars.  If you also want a multi-function printer to print the bulk of your photos at home, instead of using a separate high-quality dedicated photo printer to print photos at home or using a commercial service to print your photos, the MX922's photo print quality is better than this MX522, and it prints photos better than most multi-function printers in general.  If the price difference between this MX522 and the better MX922 was $50, then you may have to consider the extra cost.  But if you can get the MX922 for just $15 or $20 more, definitely get the MX922 instead of this MX522 because you get a lot more features for a little extra cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJY75RU3TIB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVWKUWU#wasThisHelpful","R2NJY75RU3TIB8","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies (4.5-star rating overall; 5 stars for the tripod, 4 stars for the ball head). Positives: The tripod has a high build quality and low weight, while still retaining high strength. The GH-300T pistol grip ball head's built-in shutter release trigger is quite unique. The tripod supports up to 18 pounds of maximum load capacity. The center column can be pivoted to any angle while still holding a large camera and lens at very unconventional angles. The legs can adjust to 25, 50, and 80 degree angles and the tripod can be configured from a maximum height of 67.5"" all the way down to about 7.0"" from the ground, which is great for low-angle and macro photography applications. Negatives: The tension control knob to adjust the ball head's resistance is hard to adjust to get a good balance between having enough friction to hold the camera at any angle and not having too much resistance in the pistol grip itself. Only two shutter cables are included, TC2 Canon type-2 and TN2 Nikon type-2, for lower-end Canon and Nikon cameras.  TC1 and TN1 cables for higher-end and full-frame Canons and Nikons are not included. The ""User Manual"" for the 'GH-300T' ball head is very sparse with its wording and descriptions.What is in the box package? Vanguard 283AGH tripod with Vanguard GH-300T pistol grip ball head Vanguard QS-60 ""Quick Shoe"" quick release plate Wrench and hex wrench for adjusting tripod and ball head 42-page 15-language 'Abeo Pro Series' ""User Manual"" 40-page 15-language 'GH-300T' ball head ""User Manual"" 15-language ""Limited Lifetime Warranty"" foldout sheet TC2 Canon type-2 and TN2 Nikon type-2 shutter release cables for lower-end Canon and Nikon cameras Nylon tripod bag with drawstring closurePrior to using this highly versatile tripod, I have used other Vanguard tripods that were more conventional along with Vanguard's SBH-30, SBH-50, and SBH-100 magnesium alloy ball heads, and I have been uniformly pleased with their performance.The tripod itself is a uniquely flexible contortionist that uses what Vanguard calls a ""Multi-Angle Central Column"" that can tilt, pivot, slide, and swivel into just about any angle.  When this contortionist center column is adjusted in combination with the three legs that can each pivot out to 80-degree angles, this gives the 283AGH excellent chameleon-like flexibility for converting from a tall upright tripod to a really short tripod (either by lowering the tripod and/or pivoting the camera downward to a very low height) for various tabletop, product, macro, and low-angle photography applications.  It can be fun to shoot photos or videos of a scene using a very short height to get a ""bug's eye"" view from way down low, providing a composition based on a very unique angle of view.  You can use low-angle photography for everything from portraits to landscapes.  Because the camera will be so low to the ground, you will usually have to use your LCD monitor to compose the shot, instead of looking into the viewfinder, and if your camera has an LCD screen that flips out and pivots, that makes it even easier.This tripod's three legs are equipped with three-way all-terrain feet encompassing anti-slip rubber feet, spikes, and snow/sand shoes.  While rubber feet and spikes are common on tripods, the snow/sand shoes are unique and interesting... and they actually work quite well.  When the tripod wears the snow/sand shoes, it reminds me of photos showing the Apollo Lunar Module when it landed on the Moon's surface.  Each leg telescopes using three sections and two flip locks.  Each upper leg section is wrapped with an all-weather foam grip that feels comfortable yet durable, and lets me get a secure grip of the tripod even when it is wet from rain.  I sometimes carry this tripod, with its legs fully extended, over my shoulder while moving around outside, and placing this foam grip section on my shoulder also adds to both comfort and traction while the tripod rests on my shoulder.Vanguard uses flip locks on the legs of their aluminum alloy tripods and twist locks on the legs of their carbon fiber tripods, and I think that this is a very smart manufacturing decision.  Although some tripod manufacturers use flip locks on carbon fiber tripods, carbon fiber has less flex and ""give"" than metals like aluminum and using twist locks on carbon fiber tripods apply less pressure on the tubes than flip locks.  Overall, I greatly prefer flip locks over twist locks because I think that well-designed flip-lock legs, such as those used on this 283AGH tripod, can be both loosened/extended and retracted/tightened quicker than twist-lock legs.  Flip locks are especially quicker for me when I am wearing ski gloves while adjusting a tripod high up in the mountains during winter.  I can also easily glance at flip locks to see that all of them are tightened whereas twist locks provide no visual cue that they are all tightened before I mount my camera onto the tripod head.  With tripods that use twist locks, I habitually press down on my twist-lock tripods first to see if the twist-lock legs will shift any before I mount my camera onto the tripod.Although this tripod is quite sturdy and stable when used indoors, it can be made even sturdier if I hang a counterweight such as my camera bag, backpack, or a water bottle from the accessory hook that is located at the bottom of the center column.  This hook is especially useful for weighing down the tripod if using it on uneven ground or on windy days outdoors.  Vanguard makes a nice useful Vanguard SB-100 Stone Bag that you can attach to any tripod's legs to weigh it down more.  But since this tripod's center column already includes a hook, I often hang either a camera holster, camera bag, backpack, or my Nalgene water bottle on the center column hook to help anchor the tripod and I find that is sufficient.  Sometimes, I just pull out a spare plastic grocery bag, load it up with some rocks, and hang it from the tripod's center column hook to get a rock-solid anchoring of the tripod.  To be prepared for photo outings that require more tripod stability, you may want to either always hang your camera bag onto this tripod's hook, use Vanguard's SB-100 Stone Bag, or just carry some spare grocery bags with you and you can create an improvised heavy counterweight to hang from the hook.The 283AGH has a nice orange-colored anti-shock elastomer rubber ring positioned underneath the pan head that is on top of the center column.  If you accidentally lower the center column too quickly, this anti-shock ring helps to cushion the impact of your equipment as the center column slides down onto the tripod collar.  The top pan head on the tripod can be configured for both 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch threaded head mounts using the included hex wrench to unscrew the adapter on the center column.The GH-300T pistol grip ball head that is mounted on this tripod is a really unique ball head.  I personally prefer ball heads on my tripods, and this design, with its built-in shutter release trigger, is ideally suited for action/sports/wildlife photographers and for shooting video.  If you are a landscape, wedding, or portrait photographer who likes the creative flexibility offered by this tripod's ""Multi-Angle Central Column"", you can save a lot of money by getting another Vanguard tripod that uses this same feature, but with a more conventional, and far less fussy, ball head instead.  The GH-300T has dual pan heads for smooth panning and accurately aligned panorama shots.  The top pan head, located under the quick release plate, has 72 click points for panning at precise intervals, while the bottom pan head does not click into grooves, allowing for smooth movements.If you have never used a pistol grip head before, it may feel a little weird with how you control the tension of the head by squeezing the pistol grip itself.  A knob behind the grip lets you control how much tension you need to squeeze the grip along with how much tension the grip head needs to hold the camera stationary.  But this adjustment is not precise and it is not easy to find a good balance between how much weight the tripod head will hold versus how much effort you need to squeeze the grip.  I have fairly strong hands and fingers, but I can see how this pistol grip can be hard to use for someone with weak hands.  I always seem to be fussing with the tension adjustment while trying to find the right amount of friction that is sufficient to hold the camera in place and does not require way too much force to squeeze.  I do not know how this design can be improved, but this is the sole reason why I rate this GH-300T 4 stars while the tripod gets a 5-star rating.As with the contortionist tripod, the pistol grip on the GH-300T can be rotated to eight different angles relative to the panning base.  This can be useful if the center column has been pivoted so it is no longer vertical.When the shutter release cable is connected from the pistol grip to the camera, the round orange button becomes the shutter button.  The button can also be half-pressed to initiate auto-focus, and the trigger can be slid upward to lock the shutter open when shooting in ""Bulb"" mode.  The tripod package includes only two shutter cables, a TC2 Canon type-2 cable and TN2 Nikon type-2 cable, for lower-end Canon and Nikon cameras.  TC1 and TN1 cables for higher-end and full-frame Canons and Nikons are not included.  The TC1 Canon cable is compatible with Canon 1D, 5D, 7D, 60D/50D/40D/30D/20D/10D cameras.  The TN1 Nikon cable works with Nikon D1, D3, D700/D300/D200 cameras.  It seems to me that someone who uses a high-end tripod like this would also be using a high-end camera, so Vanguard should have included the TC1/TN1 cables instead of the TC2/TN2 cables for lower-end cameras.  The TC1, TN1, and TS1 (for Sony cameras) cables can be purchased separately.Because there have been customer complaints regarding problems with the shutter release cable used on the VANGUARD GH-300T Pistol Grip Ball Head (Black), and Vanguard said that they were working to resolve the issue, I phoned Vanguard to ask about the shutter release cable connection problems.  Vanguard mailed me a free package containing updated cables, not just for the original TC2 and TN2 cables, but the package contained all five TC1, TC2, TN1, TN2, TS1 cables for high-end Canons, low-end Canons, high-end Nikons, low-end Nikons, and Sony cameras, respectively!  Considering the high price of this 283AGH tripod, I think that Vanguard should have included all five cables to begin with.  The updated TC2/TN2 cables look very similar to the original TC2/TN2 cables, but each one has a small silver-colored triangle discretely printed on the connector housing that plugs into the pistol grip.The included tripod bag securely holds this tripod, but it would have been nice if the bag also included a zippered pouch to store the wrench, hex wrench, and shutter cables while carrying this tripod around.Overall, this is an excellent tripod and pistol grip ball head.  The tension control knob to adjust the friction is the one main weak link in the total design.  But the build quality of the tripod and the thoughtful attention to detail in the other areas of this tripod are superb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHXBXVYAZ6ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7Y7HF4#wasThisHelpful","R3OHXBXVYAZ6ZN","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"   Rating: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies! Packaging, Style, Appearance:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Construction & Build Quality:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Performance, Durability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating Competitive Pricing & Value:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating Positives: This backpack can hold 2 DSLRs (or video cameras), 6-8 lenses (up to 300mm f2.8), monopod, shotgun microphones, various other camera and video gear, and a separate laptop sleeve can hold up to a 17"" laptop. This backpack has excellent no-compromise professional-grade build quality with a weather-proof coated 1680D ballistic nylon exterior, ripstop nylon interior, heavily-reinforced stitching, and high-quality YKK self-healing zippers. The four main compartments all use lockable zippers for added security, and each compartment can be separately unlocked and opened without totally exposing all of the camera gear and laptop to nearby strangers. The 14 adjustable Velcro-attached dividers allow for many different storage configurations. A removable ""WeatherWrap"" rain cover is included. The shoulder harness, waist belt, and ventilated back panels are all thickly padded. The bottom panel is waterproof so you can set the backpack onto a wet ground or sidewalk. This backpack's 14""W-x-20""H-x-9""D exterior dimensions meet airline carry-on sizing regulations. Negatives: There is no easy and secure way to carry a tripod on this nearly-perfect backpack.  Tripod attachment straps/clips/loops were not a part of this backpack's design. All zippers have 4-inch long pull cords that are excessively long as they dangle, can be a nuisance, and the pull cords can get caught on something.My first impression of this Tenba Roadie II HD-SLR/video backpack was that it is definitely professional-grade in terms of its large size, design, and build quality.  Before loading any gear into it, it already weighs 5.6 pounds empty.  This is a large backpack, and if you fully load up all the storage compartments with a laptop, cameras, lenses, microphones, and other camera/video gear, the 14""W-x-20""H-x-9""D exterior dimensions (43 linear inches) can expand out to a size of about 16""W-x-20""H-x-11""D (47 linear inches), and the total weight could reach 30 or 40 pounds; you would essentially have a carry-on luggage strapped to your back.  While this backpack will fit into the overhead bins of most airlines, it will not fit underneath the seats.  Most airlines allow a carry-on to be of a size up to 45 or 46 linear inches.  A few airlines allow a carry-on to be as large as 50 or 52 linear inches.  So this Tenba Roadie II should not present a problem as a carry-on aboard most airlines, and I could even fit this backpack into the overhead compartment of some smaller turboprop short-hop commuter planes.  If you fully load up this backpack, however, it may be difficult to squeeze it into the overhead compartment of small turboprop planes.This backpack is still very comfortable to wear even when it is bulky and heavy from being fully loaded with gear.  The panel that faces your back, the contoured shoulder harness, and the waist belt are all thickly padded.  The back panel also has a T-shaped ventilated air channel to keep your back cooler while you are lugging your gear around.  If you have to wear this fully-loaded backpack for long durations, the thickly and firmly padded waist belt, usually found on larger backcountry backpacks, will be a welcome feature.  But if you have a weak or bad back, I would not recommend fully loading up this backpack and then walking around for long periods with this strapped to your back.  All of the padding uses a high-density foam that does not compress and wear out over time with repeated use and heavy loads.  Both sides of the padded waist belt each have a zippered pocket, with the zippered pocket on the right side also containing an innovative water bottle holder so you can have a beverage container strapped to the right side of your waist while you are carrying this backpack.  The top of this backpack has a padded grab handle if you want to carry this backpack like luggage.My second impression of this backpack was that it has a lot of long zipper pull cords dangling all over it.  This backpack has a total of 21 4-inch long zipper pull cords with 12 dangling on the outside and 9 dangling on the inside.  These pull cords loop through each zipper handle and are twisted around themselves.  This may look stylish, but over time, I expected them to untwist and just become loops.  With the backpack zipped up, there are five pairs of these long zipper pull cords dangling around the outside of the backpack's compartments, looking like Rastafarian dreadlocks ponytails.  Both sides of the padded waist belt, which are connected together using heavy-duty Duraflex buckle clips, also each have a 4-inch zipper pull cord dangling from them.  When the rear-facing main camera compartment is opened up, four of the plastic pouches that line the inside of the ventilated back panel also sport 4-inch pull cords.  And the rear-facing accessory compartment has five 4-inch pull cords dangling from its five zippered interior pouches.  These pull cords are excessively and unnecessarily long, and the pull cords actually can be a nuisance and get in the way, getting caught on something else.  I sometimes loosely tie each pair of pull cords together if I do not expect to be opening up a compartment soon.  And if you have cats at home, all of these dangling pull cords make great cat toys, so you should keep this backpack away from your cats :-)  So I really wish that this backpack's 14 zipper pull cords were just 1.5 or 2.0 inches long, instead of 4 inches long.  There is absolutely no advantage to having long zipper pull cords that are 4 inches in length, and I have sometimes even had the pull cord from one zipper get caught in the zipper of another compartment that I was in the process of zipping up.The main camera compartment faces the rear (your back) while the laptop compartment and another accessory compartment face outward toward the front.  This configuration can offer added security if you are carrying a fully loaded backpack in a crowded busy market filled with strangers or you are standing on a crowded train or bus.  Pickpockets cannot surreptitiously remove camera gear from the exposed front side while your backpack is carried on your back.  If you are carrying a laptop computer on the front/outward-facing laptop sleeve, that compartment is exposed to pickpockets.  But trying to secretly pull a laptop out of this sleeve would be far more difficult than trying to remove a camera or lens from the camera's main compartment.  When all your gear is zipped up and concealed inside this backpack, it has a subdued appearance that looks more like a small piece of luggage.  Some camera backpacks have too much of a high-tech or hip and trendy appearance that screams: ""Look at me! I am carrying thousands of dollars worth of expensive camera gear!""The laptop sleeve has interior dimensions of 10.6""W-x-18""H-x-1""D.  This can hold a 17-inch laptop unless that 17-inch laptop is larger than normal or has a 9-cell battery.  One of my 17-inch laptops cannot fit in this compartment due to its 9-cell battery sticking out too much.  All 15-inch laptops can easily fit in this compartment.  On the outside of the laptop compartment is another accessory compartment with five zippered pouches, two open pouches, and a business card slot on the inside.  This accessory compartment, measuring about 9"" wide and 12"" high, is large enough to hold a small ultrabook or netbook.Two flaps on the top of this backpack unzip and open outward away from each other to reveal a top compartment where more gear and accessories can be stored.  The floor of this top compartment is actually another Velcro-attached divider, and if you remove this divider, it allows you to access the main camera compartment just by unzipping these top two flaps so you can access camera gear that is stored in the main camera compartment through this smaller top opening instead of fully opening up the main compartment and revealing to strangers all of the expensive camera gear that you have stored inside.  You can also adjust the size of this top compartment so that you can quickly access frequently used lenses just by pulling open this top compartment instead of having to unzip the main camera compartment.The main rear-facing camera compartment, the laptop compartment, the accessory compartment, and the two flaps that open up the top compartment are all equipped with lockable zippers for better security.  Obviously, if this entire backpack is actually stolen with all your gear inside, then using locking zippers makes no difference in adding security.  But there are various situations, both with studio photography and on-location shooting, where I trust that no one will steal my entire backpack of equipment, but I also do not want someone borrowing or removing equipment from my backpack.  So with these lockable zippers, I can lock up all four compartments using luggage locks.Both sides of this backpack are identical in that they both have 14-inch high zippered pockets that are great for holding longer shotgun microphones or monopods.  Near the top of each zippered pocket is a accessory loop that lets you hang additional lens cases, pouches, and carabiners from both sides of the backpack.  And on the outside of this long zippered pocket is a roomy Velcro-secured pocket for storing other gear.  With all of this storage flexibility, the one glaring omission in this backpack's design is an easy and secure way to carry a tripod.  For video work, I prefer a tripod that is equipped with a joystick/pistol-grip ball head for better pan/tilt action.  Some of these tripods are large enough to require that they be carried separately in their own bag with a sling strap.  But many video tripods can still be easily carried on a backpack that is equipped with cinch straps and buckles to firmly hold the tripod.  By leaving the Velcro-secured pocket on either side of this backpack open, I can insert three legs of a smaller tripod or two legs of a larger tripod into the bottom pocket, thereby converting that pocket into a tripod foot pouch, and I can loop a Velcro strap through the accessory loop that is sewn into the 14-inch zippered pocket to tie the middle of my tripod to the side of the backpack, but it does not firmly hold the tripod in place and the tripod can wobble around too much during transport.  This backpack could have perfectly held a larger tripod if Tenba had sewn two cinch-strap buckles along one side of the backpack to cinch the tripod along two points in addition to having two or three of the tripod's feet inserted into the bottom pocket.Because I wish that this backpack had a good way to carry a tripod, I would actually rate this Tenba Roadie II backpack 4.5 stars instead of a full 5-star rating.  But this may not been an issue for you, or you may prefer to carry a tripod in its own separate pouch and sling it over your shoulder.  Overall, this is a professional-grade camera backpack with a matching professional-grade list price of $299.  If you are more of an amateur/casual photo/video enthusiast, unless you can get this backpack at a good discount, you may consider less expensive (but still very good) camera backpacks made by Lowepro or Think Tank.  With the large size and weight of this backpack, its storage space may be more than what most people need unless you are a professional photographer/videographer.July 6, 2015 Update: There is an updated version of this Tenba Roadie II HDSLR/Video Backpack. The Tenba Roadie II HDSLR/Video Backpack model 638-333 that I reviewed here on May 15 2013 was introduced in May 2012. The updated Tenba Roadie backpack model 638-319 Tenba 638-319 HDSLR/Video Backpack (Black) was introduced in September 2014, and the updated backpack now lets you strap a tripod to the backpack and it holds the tripod feet in a pouch. Unless you can get this older 638-333 model backpack at a good price and carrying a tripod is not important to you, I would consider the newer 638-319 instead of this older model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2A0ZOGO6N23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082N9BZM#wasThisHelpful","R2E2A0ZOGO6N23","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I have previously read several ""Inside Out"" books from Microsoft Press and they have all been uniformly excellent, thorough, detailed, and evenly balanced in their coverage of a wide array of topics.  This new book on Windows 8 likewise does not disappoint and offers the right amount of detail to satisfy both average users of Windows and expert power users.  This book is not a ""Windows 8 for Dummies"" style of book, however, and its reference book layout and organization assumes at least an intermediate level of proficiency in using previous versions of Windows.  As with most intermediate-to-expert level technical books, this book has an underlying assumption that you know about some of the general Windows concepts that it talks about.  The first 195 pages of this book, encompassing eight chapters, are in a section called ""Getting Started"".  But even this section assumes that you are fairly comfortable with using a previous version of Windows, and there are no beginner-level tutorials.  After this ""Getting Started"" section, there is a ""File Management"" section (Chapters 9-13), ""Music, Videos, TV, and Movies"" section (Chapters 14-27), ""Security and Privacy"" (Chapters 18-20), ""Networking"" (Chapters 21-24), and ""Maintaining, Tuning, and Troubleshooting"" (Chapters 25-57).  Although all of this information would also be very helpful in a business office environment (e.g. a whole Chapter 20 is devoted to using the ""Hyper-V"" virtual machine functionality), this book is more oriented towards individuals and home users.  If you are looking to set up Windows Server 2012 (Windows 8 Server), the Windows Server 2012 Inside Out book is great for that.With this book being organized like a reference guide, you do not need to read every page sequentially from start to finish.  The first 195 pages in the ""Getting Started"" section should be read through, but then you can hop around in different chapters depending upon your needs and questions.  I installed my first Windows 8 Pro from a DVD last November.  Prior to doing that, I had already read through a large amount of Windows 8 ""survival guides"" and ""transition guides"" that were posted on various Web sites; reading these online guides helped me immensely even before I purchased the Windows 8 Pro DVD.My one small quibble with this book is that the much-despised Start screen of Windows 8 is not addressed until Chapter 5, while a discussion about Windows 8 apps is discussed early on in Chapter 2.  For someone who is upgrading/transitioning to Windows 8, having to deal with the Start screen could be a more urgent and immediate issue than managing Windows 8 apps.  For example, after I installed Windows 8 Pro last year, one of my immediate questions was: ""How do I shutdown, reboot, and logoff in Windows 8?"", since those functions were previously tied to the old Start menu on the desktop.  Luckily, this is covered on page 113; you create two shortcut tiles to reboot or shutdown Windows.  But instruction is not given on how to create a similar tile to logoff from Windows, even though you can adapt the page-113 instructions to use the 'shutdown /l' or 'logoff' Windows command to create a shortcut tile that logs you off.  Microsoft also offers on their Web site a more complicated way to create shutdown/restart/logoff tiles on the Start screen using a bundled PowerShell script that you can download (I include the download link in the 'Comments' section of my review).  I am still puzzled as to why Microsoft did not just include these three shortcut tiles by default in a new installation of Windows 8.  If you hanker for the old Start menu that had been yanked out of Windows 8, page 119 talks about third-party apps that you can install to get the old Start menu back, and how to automatically begin at the desktop instead of landing in the Windows 8 tiled Start screen whenever you initially login to Windows 8.  For many users who are accustomed to their old Windows Start menu and desktop, all this useful information should have been moved up earlier in the book, and the Chapter 2 discussion about Windows 8 apps could have been postponed to be the next chapter after Chapter 5.  This book's Chapter 5 is called ""Personalizing Windows 8"", but much of it could be called ""Transitioning to the Windows 8 User Interface"".As useful as this book is with its thorough coverage of Windows 8, a HUGE bonus is that with the purchase of this book, you also get an access code that allows you to download a free eBook PDF copy of this book!  The book also describes how to access 50 how-to videos totaling several hours of instructions that are narrated and demonstrated by the author himself.  Each of these short how-to videos are a few minutes in length, and they can provide even better instructions than what was written in the book, especially for people who like to learn by seeing instead of just reading.  You can bookmark the Web page link containing the how-to videos to access them while you are reading the printed book.  If you are reading the eBook, it conveniently contains a listing of links for all the videos so you can just click a link within the eBook to access one of the videos.  All of the printed book's images are in black-and-white, but the eBook's images are in full color.  So along with being far more useful than the printed book since I can quickly search within the eBook for keywords, the eBook looks nicer with its color images.  And if I am already carrying a laptop/ultrabook/netbook anyway, I do not have to lug this heavy printed book around with me.  I really wish that all technical books offered a free eBook accompaniment like this since it is so convenient to always have with my computer, I can quickly search through the content, and I can copy-and-paste programming code and computer commands directly from an eBook instead of having to type out what was written in a printed book.I highly recommend this great book if you are either an average/intermediate or advanced/expert user of Windows!  If you are a hardcore power user of Windows or if you are a system administrator who is responsible for maintaining Windows 8 in an office environment, this book is not a totally all-encompassing tome describing all the various aspects of Windows 8 internals or the use of Windows 8 in a corporate environment.  So I hesitate to call this book the ""ultimate, in-depth reference"", which is the wording written on this book's cover.  But then again, for most technical topics such as operating systems, programming languages, and software technologies, I often end up buying more than one book on the topic because each book has different strengths and weaknesses.  But this book nicely balances the ""what you need to know"" information with lots of useful tips, and because it covers a lot of ground within its 700+ pages, it may be the only Windows 8 book that many people need.  If you are a novice at using Windows, however, this should not be your first Windows 8 book, even though this can be the second or third Windows 8 book that you read.Note: As with many technical books, this book has a few errors within it.  At the time of this review's writing, there are 9 errors verified by the author and 3 unconfirmed errors in this book's content.  In the 'Comments' section of my review, I list the link to the O'Reilly Web site where the errata for this book are listed and described.  The O'Reilly Web site is also where you would go to enter the access code for downloading the eBook PDF version of this book.  The errors were all reported several months ago or during last year.  I can understand that it takes time to update the printed version of this book with the corrections to the errors, but these errors were still in the eBook PDF that I downloaded last month.  It would be nice if the eBook PDF file could be updated quicker.  I could then re-download an updated version of the eBook that had the the errors corrected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZ1O2IA2M82F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0735663815#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZ1O2IA2M82F","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: This is a small compact very-portable hard drive considering that it houses 1-TB of storage space, a Wi-Fi access point, and a rechargeable battery. The internal rechargeable battery can provide about 10 hours of juice.  But if you are streaming large HD videos all the time, the battery life will be much shorter. Negatives: The ""Seagate Media"" mobile app only supports a limited number of digital video formats (M4V/MP4/MOV/AVI). Along with the included AC adapter wall charger, this package should also include a car charger too. Since this hard drive is designed with portability in mind, I wish that it came with a carrying case.What is in the box package? 1-TB hard drive USB-to-DC cable with AC adapter charger USB 3.0 adapter with detachable USB 3.0 cable ""Quick Start Guide"" foldout leaflet 24-page 24-language 3-Year Limited Warranty bookletIn this age of BYOD and multi-device multi-media interoperability, this Seagate Wireless Plus is a really great idea!  I used to copy videos and photos to my iPad and copy music, videos, and photos to my netbook/ultrabook, which can be tedious to do on a weekly basis.  But with a hard drive like this, I can now wirelessly share all files with up to eight mobile devices.  This little hard drive is amazingly compact considering that it is a 1-TB drive combined with the electronics to make it a Wi-Fi access point and it includes an internal rechargeable battery that keeps the media streaming for about ten hours.Set up was pretty easy.  However, this is NOT a plug-and-play device, and the included printed ""Quick Start Guide"" is VERY sparse, even when compared to the ""Quick Start Guide"" included with other electronics.  In the 'Comment' section of my review, I include a link to Seagate's Web site where you can download a ""User Guide"" PDF file that is far more useful than the printed ""Quick Start Guide"" that is included in this package.  By default, the Wi-Fi network is not password-protected, so anyone within the area can conveniently access your files.  So after you download the ""Seagate Media"" app, you should set a password, which turns on WPA-level wireless security to ensure the privacy of your files or data.Streaming of movies was flawless and free of glitches, lags, and stutters.  The downloadable ""User Guide"" states that the wireless range is ""close to 150 feet"", with the usual caveat that walls and obstructions will interfere with the strength of the signal.  Being 60 to 70 feet away with an unobstructed line of sight, the signal is very strong.  When I start having walls or different floors of the house get in the way, the signal proportionally degrades and I get stuttering.Overall, this is a great little device.  I rate this 4-stars instead of 5-stars, however, mainly because it could be improved to have more flexibility in streaming more of the popular varieties of digital video formats.  And for the price, it would have been nice if the package included a waterproof carrying case that could store the hard drive along with its USB adapter and cables.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVNG9JMUGSQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQRUW4Q#wasThisHelpful","RQVNG9JMUGSQ9","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies. Positives: Feature-rich powerful route and trip planning, with expanded points of interests. This software is ideally suited for use on my older Dell Mini 10 netbook (or a compact ultrabook), which is then paired with my Garmin GPS. Negatives: The user interface and general usability have not been much improved since ""Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007"". In some areas, the address search and map data is not as accurate and up-to-date as my Garmin GPS.Prior to this 2013 version, I have used the 2007 and 2011 versions of S&T.  The update in going from 2007 to 2011 was far greater than updating 2011 to this 2013 version.  The product description's ""System Requirements"" for this software does not include Windows 8, but it runs fine on my little Dell Mini 10 netbook running Windows 8.  For actual trip and route planning, using S&T is far better and easier than trying to do everything on my Garmin GPS.  However, for bigger trips involving many hours of driving, I still use a combination of this S&T software, Google Maps, several Web sites that specialize in road trip planning, and lots of Internet searching/researching to map out my routes and plans.  S&T can output a .gpx file that I can then import into my Garmin Nuvi GPS for the actual in-car driving directions.While there have been some incremental improvements to this 2013 version, the user interface and general usability feel somewhat outdated.  As mentioned, even this software's ""System Requirements"" only list ""Platform: Windows 7/Vista/XP"" ad omit any mention of Windows 8, as if the internal user interface code has not  changed much since 2007 when I was running S&T on Windows Vista.If you already have ""Microsoft Streets and Trips 2011"" or the 2012 version, there is really not enough reason to upgrade to this 2013 version.  However, if your current version is 2007, this does make a pretty good upgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DA6F1Z04E8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RFW1NA#wasThisHelpful","R2DA6F1Z04E8M","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I previously added two of these 5400-RPM Western Digital Scorpio Blue drives in the 1-TB size on a laptop that is often used for the editing of photos, images, and very large video files.  I liked them so much that I added this 750-GB to a four-year old Windows laptop.  My older laptop has a weaker battery and 90-watt AC adapter, so I choose this Scorpio Blue instead of the Scorpio Black because I do not need maximum performance, and I prefer the lower-power, cooler, and quieter operation of this hard drive.The 9.5mm-height form factor of this drive means that it can fit inside most laptops.  There are four threaded inserts on the two longer sides of the drive for use with standard mounting screws; no mounting screws or hard drive bracket/caddy are provided with this hard drive.  This drive is rated at a very quiet 22 dBA sound level when idle, and 25 dBA when the drive is seeking/reading/writing.  With this drive installed inside my laptop, I can only barely hear the drive's operations in a very quiet room when my ears are about one to two feet away from the drive's location inside the laptop and the drive is actively reading/writing.  When the laptop is idle, I do not hear the drive at all.  And even if this hard drive is actively seeking/reading/writing, its tiny sound is masked by my laptop's fan noise even if the fan starts running from its slowest speed.When tested using the ""HD Tune"" hard drive performance benchmarking tool, it turns out that this 5400-RPM Scorpio Blue drive compares favorably to the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drives, even though the faster Black drives also have a 16-MB cache compared to the smaller 8-MB cache on the Blue drives.  On my installed 750-GB drive, HD Tune reported a minimum/maximum/average read speed of 53, 110, and 85 MB/sec, and a minimum/maximum/average write speed of 40, 108, and 84 MB/sec.  This is only about 15% to 18% slower than the performance of the 750-GB 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drive, which runs faster and hotter, and uses more power.  This 5400-RPM drive is slightly faster than Seagate's 7200-RPM Momentus drive, and it even compares favorably to Seagate's Momentus XT Hybrid Drive.  This drive's random access read and write times are also comparable to both the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black and Seagate's 7200-RPM Momentus drives.  If you are trying to decide between the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drive (or some other faster 7200-RPM mobile-form-factor drive), the Black drive will be about 15% to 18% faster than this drive.  However, this 750-GB drive is slightly slower than the WD Blue 1 TB Mobile Hard Drive: 2.5 Inch, 5400 RPM, SATA II, 8 MB Cache - WD10JPVT.  So if you can spend about $20 more for 250-GB of extra space on the 1-TB version of this drive, you get a slightly faster read/write speed compared to this 750-GB drive.Western Digital offers an ""Acronis TrueImage"" that can be downloaded from their Web site to let you copy all your data from an old drive to a new drive so you do not have to reinstall your operating system to get all the benefits of a new drive.  If you do replace your main system drive, you can either use cloning software such as ""Acronis True Image"" to mirror all your system files and applications back onto the new drive, or you can perform a fresh OS install and reinstall all applications that you were using.  The advantage of cloning your system files and applications is that it is much faster to put everything back onto the new drive.  The advantage of performing fresh installs of the OS and applications is that it can often declutter your files and free up hundreds of megabytes of space (which is like totally cleaning out a basement that has accumulated years of stuff).If you are trying to decide between the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drive (or some other faster 7200-RPM mobile-form-factor drive), the ""Black"" drive will be about 10% to 15% faster than this ""Blue"" drive.  This drive has pretty good performance for a 5400-RPM drive and it does not use as much energy or generate as much heat as a 7200-RPM drive.  If you frequently use your laptop unplugged and you want to maximize the number of hours that you can run on battery power, 5400-RPM drives drain the battery less than 7200-RPM drives.  The Scorpio Black drives already use less power than many 7200-RPM laptop drives.  But these Scorpio Blue drives use 20% less power when reading/writing and 25% less power when idling than the Scorpio Black drives.  I can dream about the day that it becomes affordable to equip a laptop with two 1-TB SSD drives, but for now, this 5400-RPM drive is really not that much slower compared to most 7200-RPM drives.I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope that this review helped you to be a wise shopper! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7Y4I1OFLGTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CI41Z6#wasThisHelpful","RA7Y4I1OFLGTP","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

On my installed 750-GB drive, HD Tune reported a minimum/maximum/average read speed of 53, 110, and 85 MB/sec, and a minimum/maximum/average write speed of 40, 108, and 84 MB/sec.  This is only about 15% to 18% slower than the performance of the 750-GB 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drive, which runs faster and hotter, and uses more power.  This 5400-RPM drive is slightly faster than Seagate's 7200-RPM Momentus drive, and it even compares favorably to Seagate's Momentus XT Hybrid Drive.  This drive's random access read and write times are also comparable to both the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black and Seagate's 7200-RPM Momentus drives.  If you are trying to decide between the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drive (or some other faster 7200-RPM mobile-form-factor drive), the Black drive will be about 15% to 18% faster than this drive.  However, this 750-GB drive is slightly slower than the WD Blue 1 TB Mobile Hard Drive: 2.5 Inch, 5400 RPM, SATA II, 8 MB Cache - WD10JPVT.  So if you can spend about $20 more for 250-GB of extra space on the 1-TB version of this drive, you get a slightly faster read/write speed compared to this 750-GB drive.Western Digital offers an ""Acronis TrueImage"" that can be downloaded from their Web site to let you copy all your data from an old drive to a new drive so you do not have to reinstall your operating system to get all the benefits of a new drive.  If you do replace your main system drive, you can either use cloning software such as ""Acronis True Image"" to mirror all your system files and applications back onto the new drive, or you can perform a fresh OS install and reinstall all applications that you were using.  The advantage of cloning your system files and applications is that it is much faster to put everything back onto the new drive.  The advantage of performing fresh installs of the OS and applications is that it can often declutter your files and free up hundreds of megabytes of space (which is like totally cleaning out a basement that has accumulated years of stuff).If you are trying to decide between the 7200-RPM Scorpio Black drive (or some other faster 7200-RPM mobile-form-factor drive), the ""Black"" drive will be about 10% to 15% faster than this ""Blue"" drive.  This drive has pretty good performance for a 5400-RPM drive and it does not use as much energy or generate as much heat as a 7200-RPM drive.  If you frequently use your laptop unplugged and you want to maximize the number of hours that you can run on battery power, 5400-RPM drives drain the battery less than 7200-RPM drives.  The Scorpio Black drives already use less power than many 7200-RPM laptop drives.  But these Scorpio Blue drives use 20% less power when reading/writing and 25% less power when idling than the Scorpio Black drives.  I can dream about the day that it becomes affordable to equip a laptop with two 1-TB SSD drives, but for now, this 5400-RPM drive is really not that much slower compared to most 7200-RPM drives.I rely both on my own research and the opinions of others to help me make informed buying decisions.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I have two of these 1-TB drives installed in a laptop that is often used for the editing of photos, images, and very large video files.  I had originally considered getting two of the faster 7200-RPM ""Scorpio Black"" series drives.  But the largest ""Black"" drive is 750 GB, and for my purposes of needing storage space more than speed, the 2 TB of disk space from having two of these 1-TB drives installed in my laptop is significantly more important than having 500-GB less space by installing two of the faster 7200-RPM 750-GB ""Black"" drives.The 9.5mm-height form factor of this drive means that it can fit inside most laptops.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I previously added two of these 5400-RPM Western Digital Scorpio Blue drives in the 1-TB size on a laptop that is often used for the editing of photos, images, and very large video files.  I liked them so much that I added this 750-GB to a four-year old Windows laptop.  My older laptop has a weaker battery and 90-watt AC adapter, so I choose this Scorpio Blue instead of the Scorpio Black because I do not need maximum performance, and I prefer the lower-power, cooler, and quieter operation of this hard drive.The 9.5mm-height form factor of this drive means that it can fit inside most laptops.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I first heard about Coenzyme Q10 in 2007 after reading Dr. Andrew Weil's book ""Healthy Aging"" and it really piqued my curiosity since CoQ10 has the unique ability to increase oxygen utilization in our cells.  Many people still have not heard about Coenzyme Q10 since it is far less publicized than the usual vitamins and minerals.  But in 1978, Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry and part of the reason for the award was his discovery of how CoQ10 helps the mitochondria in our cells turn oxygen into energy.These soft-gel capsules are quite large in size, but I found them easy to swallow when washed down with a big gulp of water.  I have not felt any side effects from taking this supplement.  This is a very valuable supplement to take, especially as you age into your 40s, 50s, and beyond.  I highly recommend this supplement!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10R4RUZY9RTPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OXABS#wasThisHelpful","R10R4RUZY9RTPG","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!Since the best sources of B-12 come from animal products, vegans and vegetarians can be at risk for B-12 deficiencies.  Previous studies have shown that, in some areas, more than 90% of vegans had B-12 deficiencies in their diet.  For more than three decades now, I have been on a vegetarian diet that includes dairy and egg.  And for vegetarians like me, two-thirds of vegetarians can also be susceptible to B-12 deficiencies.  I must admit that I do not notice the advertised benefit of ""promotes better sleep"" after taking this for several weeks... but I also never have sleep problems anyway.  And I did not notice any difference in energy level or healthier nerve/brain tissue.  A large part of the problem with trying to self-analyze myself after taking supplements like this is that it can be extremely difficult to subjectively judge without being mentally tripped up by possible placebo effects.  I would say the same thing about trying to judge the efficacy of taking vitamin C, D, or other B-complex vitamins.  But these chewable vitamin lozenges have a nice tasty cherry flavor to them, and they do not upset my stomach.  B-12 is a water-soluble vitamin, so unlike the fat-soluble vitamins A/D/E/K, this can be taken without being accompanied by food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGAJL1G7GBAQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OQGO6#wasThisHelpful","RGAJL1G7GBAQM","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.Over the years, I have used a variety of TASCAM pro studio gear, including their recorders and mixers, and I have been uniformly pleased with their performance.  The sound of these headphones is very good, especially when you consider the low price of these headphones.  The treble high frequencies are nicely balanced, without being too muted or too sizzling hot, and it never sounds too strident even when played loud.  The midrange and vocals are smooth.  The bass is taut, but I would have preferred a deeper bass response from the 50mm drivers used in these headphones.  Although everyone's head is sized and shaped a bit differently, I have a large head that sometimes cannot fit into some baseball caps even when the baseball caps are adjusted to maximum looseness.  And for me, these headphones clamp onto my ears a bit too tight.  Luckily, the ear cups feel comfortably padded around my ears so the discomfort is not too great.  The ear cup cavities are a bit on the small side, which is not a problem for me, but can be uncomfortable for people with big ears.  The headphone cable is generously long, almost 10 feet in length, which is great for both DJ and studio work.  Overall, the build quality is pretty good, again taking into account the value pricing of these headphones.  These headphones are not premium-grade, but they are also not premium-priced.  They are a great value for the price, as long as your head is not too big like mine and you are not expecting very deep bass output.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G0CRH8DM2XMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1N06PO#wasThisHelpful","R1G0CRH8DM2XMA","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary: Recommended with warm fuzzies.Inside this concise easy-to-read book are 39 rules for delivering great customer service.  Each numbered rule is explained within four to seven pages, with lots of anecdotes from the author's personal experiences.  To me, most of these rules amount to empathizing with the customers and treating them the way that you would want to be treated as a customer, regardless of the business or industry that you are involved in.  A few of the rules, such as ""Rule #29: Have a Geek on Your Team"" (so that you can keep up with, and take advantage of, the latest technologies), are not so much about customer service, but more about having good business acumen.  The 39 rules that are presented here are definitely not the ultimate, most comprehensive, collection of customer service advice.  But as a book that you can share with your co-workers, managers and non-managers alike, this book is useful for reminding us of some good core business practices, and this book can be completely read within a single day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OM7RL8KDQT7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770435602#wasThisHelpful","R3OM7RL8KDQT7H","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although I would prefer a bit more of a peanut flavor to the taste, it is pretty good.  This protein bar has a bit of a mealy grainy texture to it.  The outside is drizzled with a little chocolate with some crunchy bits.  I like its texture and I prefer a snack bar texture that is less sticky and gooey since most gooey snack bars are loaded with corn syrup.  Each one-bar serving has a good coverage of the most common essential vitamins: Vitamins A, C, E, Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folate, B12, Biotin, and Pantothenic Acid are all at 25% RDA.Because this vegetarian-friendly protein bar contains whey protein, milk protein, and soy protein, if you are allergic to either soy or dairy products, you should probably avoid this protein bar.  Whey protein may cause gas, bloating, cramps, fatigue, and headaches in some people.  Whey protein is derived from dairy sources, and if you have lactose intolerance, you may be more susceptible to these side effects from consuming whey protein.  And since this protein bar contains whey and milk protein, it is suitable for vegetarians like me, but not suitable for people on a vegan diet.Many people, like me, eat a protein bar like this, instead of eating a regular candy bar, because they are physically active, like to stay fit, and tend to eat a healthy diet.  The reason that I rate this protein bar 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the 5 grams of fat (8% RDA, including 3.5 grams of saturated fat (18% RDA)), 14 grams of sugar, and 190 milligrams of sodium (8% RDA) are a bit high compared to some other healthy snack bars.  Although everyone's palate differs, I think that these protein bars would taste even better with less sodium added to each bar.  But then again, I also think that many restaurants add too much salt to their dishes too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DHN5UVGZ85H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057D888G#wasThisHelpful","R10DHN5UVGZ85H","A24HWYHR28JJ7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24HWYHR28JJ7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Belkin has a good reputation for cell-phone products, at least, as far as I can tell by reading Amazon reviews. They make different types of chargers, adapters, USB cables, and so forth. And their products come in pretty colors, which is an important factor for someone like me, who hates the traditional black cables! So when I had the chance to get this USB/Lightning cable, I decided to go ahead and give it a try.It's very short, just six inches, which makes it ideal for charging your phone while you're driving---provided you don't actually need to use the phone while it's charging. If the phone is just going to sit in your center console, it's perfect. It would also work for syncing your phone with your laptop. One end is a standard USB plug, while the other end is a Lightning plug, which works with the latest generation of iPhones, iPads, and iPods. I have an iPhone 6, so it's exactly what I needed.Also, it's a lovely shade of purple. Sometimes you order a ""purple"" USB cable and it ends up being pink, or lavender, or magenta, or any color except purple, which can be frustrating. I like my cables and chargers to be color-coded, so I can easily tell them apart from my husband's. And I really love purple, so that's my color of choice. The last time I bought a purple charging cable, it was bright magenta, which was disappointing. But this one is exactly as advertised, a lovely shade of purple.I'm not really tech savvy, so I can't offer specs or compare it with similar models. But I can tell you that it works, which is the most important thing, right? I used it to charge my phone while out and about town, and it performed quite well. I'll give it four stars and recommend it to anyone who needs a very short, purple, Lightning to USB charging cable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38DIC6M283L2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDMZ4IS#wasThisHelpful","R38DIC6M283L2B","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed with this book. It bills itself as a guide for fashion designers, but I can't see how it would actually help anyone who's interested in fashion design. It's really just a catalog for the author's artwork. It's beautifully rendered, with pages that look like aged parchment, and intricate borders around the edges. Very pretty! However, it seems like English isn't the author's native language. The grammar is poor, sentences are phrased awkwardly, and so forth. I wouldn't call the errors typos, it's more like the author just isn't familiar with English.Also, the entire Kindle book has no text---it's a series of images, scans of the original book's pages. This means it takes several seconds to turn each page, because the image has to load. So if you want to flip back and forth to compare drawings, or search through the book for a specific page, it'll take forever. Several times, my Kindle Fire actually crashed, because it couldn't handle loading the graphics! This is not acceptable in a Kindle book.Aside from that, there's very little instruction for drawing your own sketches. It includes templates that you can use, but they're very stylized---so much so, that the models look like anorexic aliens, with huge heads, tiny necks, and extremely long, bony legs. I know fashion models are meant to be tall and thin, but this is absurd. The normal human being is 7 1/2 to 8 heads tall, while fashion sketches are generally 8 1/2 to 9 heads tall. The author's sketches are even taller and skinnier, with at least one having no less than 10 heads! It looks ridiculous.As a point in the author's favor, her fabrics are rendered beautifully. Very lush and detailed, which I know can be difficult to achieve. I just wish she'd explained how she'd drawn them. As another negative, there's a large section of ""historical costumes,"" but as a historical costumer myself, I can testify that most of these are anything but accurate. Granted, the medieval period isn't my personal specialty, but the ""medieval tavern wench"" and ""medieval costume"" don't resemble anything I've seen from the medieval period. Some of the later costumes have accurate details, but the silhouettes are all wrong. The key to making a historical fashion sketch look right is the shape of the garment. With many of these dresses, the skirts are limp, as if they have no petticoats underneath. Also, they have very modern bust shapes, as if the model is wearing a modern bra, instead of the appropriate underpinnings. If these were supposed to be ""historically inspired"" modern garments, it wouldn't be a problem, but that isn't the case.I'll give this book two stars, because the sketches are pretty. But as far as being a help or inspiration for fashion designers? I shouldn't think so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLBJRF60JD0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100AX7KY#wasThisHelpful","R2JLBJRF60JD0D","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this YA book, even though it had a few flaws. The story will definitely mean more if you're familiar with ""Les Miserables,"" either the musical, any of the movies, or the original classic book. If you have no idea what ""Les Mis"" is about, who the characters are, and what happens, you may find yourself feeling a bit lost. Events happen that parallel the original story, but they aren't always explained in detail, so you may be left wondering if you've missed something.The story is told in first-person, from the point of view of Eponine, a pivotal character in ""Les Mis,"" even though the original story isn't about her. Briefly put, ""Les Mis"" is about a man, Jean Valjean, who is unjustly imprisoned and then struggles to make a better life for himself once being released. It takes place in early 19th century Paris (post-Napoleon), which is a political powder-keg waiting to explode. Jean Valjean ends up being responsible for a woman being turned away from her job, and when the woman dies on the streets, he swears he'll find her young daughter and raise her as his own child. He rescues the daughter, Cosette, who was basically enslaved by Eponine's parents, and takes her to Paris, where she grows up with moderate wealth and happiness. Fast forward a few years, and Cosette falls in love with a young gentleman, Marius, who is working to start a revolution in Paris. He and his friends succeed in starting their revolt, but it's short-lived, with tragic results. Marius survives, thanks to both Eponine and Jean Valjean, and he and Cosette live happily ever after.How does Eponine fit into all of this? She's also in love with Marius. Realizing he won't ever love her, she helps him woo Cosette, and even saves his life at one point during the revolt. The only backstory Eponine gets (at least in the musical), is that she grew up with Cosette. As children, Eponine was well-off, while Cosette wore rags and worked herself ragged. When they meet again, their positions are reversed---now Eponine is living in poverty, while Cosette has a happy life. You don't learn much about Eponine, but in this book, ""A Little in Love,"" you finally get a glimpse into her unhappy childhood. As a young girl, Eponine desperately wants to be a good person, to be honest, and kind to others, but the only way she can earn her mother's affection is to present her with stolen goods, or to be cruel to others--especially to Cosette. A part of her withers with every coin she steals and every harsh word she utters, but eventually, she has the chance to live her own life. She wants to be a person worthy of Marius's love, but to her dismay, Cosette has already stolen his heart.This is a tragic story, filled with suffering and misery. But it also shows how the goodness of a person's heart can see them through the hard times.It's well-written, with a fast pace. In fact, I read the whole novel in just a few hours, so it's a good book if you're looking for something that won't take forever to finish. It reads a bit too easily at times---it's definitely YA, not adult---but the author has an excellent voice, and she's a great storyteller. Many scenes were vivid and detailed, with descriptions that pull you right into the story. The downside is, the book doesn't have nearly as much content as it could have. It skips over long periods of time, jumping forward, instead of fleshing things out. There was so much potential, events that could have happened, scenes that could have had MORE. I felt like perhaps the author didn't want the story to get too dark, so she glossed over things that would, most likely, have happened to Eponine in Paris. I think the author should have embraced the darkness, instead of fighting it, since ""Les Miserables"" is, by its very nature, a dark story.There were also a few scenes where I was strongly reminded of the recent movie/musical. A couple of sections contained word-for-word quotes, which is definitely something you want to avoid when writing a book based off a famous movie or play. It's simply too distracting, not to mention the potential for copyright infringement! But these were few and far-between, so I can forgive them. Mostly.I'll give this book four stars, because it was an entertaining way to spend the evening. However, I'll only recommend it if you're a fan of ""Les Mis"" and want to know more of Eponine's personal backstory. If you haven't read the book, or seen the musical, or any of the movies, you'll probably want to skip it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYFPJG7KI9Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545829607#wasThisHelpful","R2AYFPJG7KI9Q0","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been wanting to try a rotary cutter for some time now, but it's always intimidated me. I'm rather clumsy at times and I was scared I'd slip while cutting and slice my hand. Enter the Ruler Handle, a small handle that attaches to your ruler via suction cups! It elevates your hand, so there's less risk of you getting hurt while rotary cutting. It also gives you an easier way of holding your ruler straight while cutting.The suction cups on mine are clear, not black as shown in the description photo. But that's even better!The only problem I've found is that the suction cups will not stick to a ruler that has tiny holes in it. Apparently, the suction cups can't fully adhere if the surface isn't solid. Unfortunately, many quilting rulers have small holes running down the middle. My new ruler has holes running along its entire length, but my older ruler only has holes across half of it, which means I can use the older ruler, so long as I'm careful where I place the handle. This is annoying, because it's an old ruler, faded and worn out. I was planning to retire it, but now I have to keep it around for use with my rotary cutter. But I suppose this isn't the product's fault. It's just how suction cups work.All in all, I'm pleased with this product. I used a rotary cutter for the first time the other day and the handle worked quite well. I'll give it four stars and recommend it to anyone who sews, quilts, or crafts, and needs to keep their ruler steady while measuring or drawing lines.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQGQYXMXERKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTHDX22#wasThisHelpful","R3NQGQYXMXERKK","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pack of 100 white magazine-size comic boards. Most people use them as a backing for comic books in protective sleeves, to prevent the comic from getting bent. They're very stiff, but not too thick, so I can see how they would work great for that purpose. Personally, I ordered them because I'd read a blog post about using them to wrap fabric around, to help organize your sewing room. I haven't quite mastered the art of wrapping fabric around these boards, but they do seem sturdy enough to support a yard of lightweight to medium-weight fabric.My only complaint is that these boards don't come in a box. You get a giant stack of them, but they're shrink-wrapped, which means once you tear the plastic off, you have a hundred loose boards, with nothing to keep them contained. If you aren't planning to use all of them right away, it could be a problem. Also, because of the lack of a protective box, the top board had a damaged edge.In general, I'm happy with this purchase. Not sure if I'd buy again---I guess it depends on whether I can master the art of fabric-wrapping. But my husband collects comics, so if I can't use all of them, I'm sure he'd be happy to take them off my hands!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B02RFHRSER2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002R45BB0#wasThisHelpful","R2B02RFHRSER2K","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a transparent ruler, perfect for anyone who sews, quilts, or crafts. It's printed with a 1/8-inch grid, so you can measure both width and length, which is fantastic. (I have another transparent ruler that does not have a grid, and it's so much harder to measure seam allowances with.)I ordered this to replace my old ruler, which is getting pretty dinged up and faded. What I received must be an upgraded version, because it's different from my old ruler---in a good way! The grid and numbers are a darker shade of blue, which makes them a lot easier to see. The numbers along one edge are much larger, which makes them easier to see. No more squinting at the ruler, trying to read the tiny, faded numbers! Also, there are small holes running down the entire length of the ruler, which allows you to use it to draw circles. Just place a pin in one of the holes---whichever one is at the measurement equal to the radius of the circle you want to draw---and then place your pencil at the short edge, and pivot the ruler, drawing your circle.The drawback is, the small holes make it impossible to use a suction-cup handle with this ruler. When you're cutting with a rotary cutter, you need a sturdy ruler that you can anchor in place with a suction-cup handle. (The handle raises your hand above the ruler, so you won't slice your fingers if you accidentally slip with the rotary cutter. They're VERY sharp!) Well, unfortunately, the small holes prevent the suction cup from adhering to the ruler. So it won't work for cutting bias strips with a rotary cutter. But that's a minor inconvenience, unless you were hoping to get away with only having one all-purpose ruler.I also appreciate that the new ruler has numbers oriented in both directions, so you don't have to turn the ruler the other way just to read the numbers. (Unless it's upside-down, in which case, the numbers will be backwards and yes, you'll have to turn it over.) But with my old ruler, I was always having to rotate it the other way, just so I could read the numbers. No more! And, as a bonus, the new ruler has a hole at one end, which allows you to hang it from a hook.In short, I'm extremely pleased with this ruler! It's so much easier to use than my old one. I'll give it five stars and heartily recommend it to anyone who sews, quilts, or crafts. It's great for measuring fabric, drafting patterns, and so forth.P.S.

"This is plain black ink---the large tank, which I believe it uses for printing text. Our printer has a second black ink, which is narrow, like the colored inks. Its code number is #226, so double-check before you order, just to be sure you're replacing the correct ink tank.This ink is pretty good. I mean, I can't really use any other type of ink in our printer, so it's hard to compare it with other brands. But it does a fair enough job. And by that I mean the text it prints is black, like it should be. It's easy to install, although if you've never done it before, it might take you a minute to figure it out. You have to peel off a bit of shrink-wrapping, then twist this orange thing off the top of the ink, while being careful not to accidentally block this tiny hole with your fingers. After that, you just open your printer and pull out the old, used ink, and pop the new one in. It's pretty straightforward.I have no complaints, except for the fact that our printer guzzles this stuff like mad. But I think that's the printer's fault, not the ink's. I tend to print in spurts, I'll have several things to print one day, then I'll go a week or two without printing anything. Be warned---if you go more than a week without printing, the ink can dry up and clog, which ruins the ink tank. This has happened to us more than once. So try to print something every week, even if you don't really need to, just to keep the ink flowing.Four stars, good product. Recommended to anyone with a printer that takes this type of ink, especially if you print a lot of word documents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYS1RFFL8L59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QR67QU#wasThisHelpful","R1GYS1RFFL8L59","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not really tech savvy, so I can't quote statistics at you, or compare this cable with others that are out there. What I CAN tell you is that this is a perfectly serviceable USB cable with a Lightning tip. It can be used to charge your iPhone (5 and 6 only, I believe), as well as newer iPads, and any other devices that use a Lightning connector. It's pretty long, so it'll reach places that the shorter cables won't. And it allows for a swift charge, so I'm happy.Oh, and it's purple! What's not to love? The only thing is, the cable I received is not lavender, as pictured. It's a much darker pinkish-purple. That's fine---I didn't necessarily need lavender, I just wanted something in the purple color family. But if you're expecting a pastel lavender, as shown, you might be disappointed.Other than that, I have no complaints. At home, I keep it plugged into a USB charging port on my nightstand, so I can plug my iPhone in whenever I need to charge it. I've used it daily for several months now, and it's never failed me. I also take it with me when I travel, so I can charge my iPhone in the car or at the hotel. I'll subtract a star because the color was so far off from what I was expecting, but since it's otherwise an excellent USB cable, I'll give it four stars in all.

"This device is very interesting! I saw it advertised on ""Shark Tank,"" a TV show that features people who've come up with a unique product they want to sell. If one of the investors likes the product and thinks the person is capable of selling it globally, they'll sponsor them, giving them funding in exchange for a percentage of their company. Needless to say, this product won a sponsor. But what is it, exactly? It's tool that allows you to apply pressure to spots on your back or neck, without contorting yourself in an effort to reach them.Aha! Genius. Pure genius!I have both fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome, along with other medical conditions. As a result, I often get pinched nerves from spasming muscles. It's a painful condition that's treated with heat and massage, along with applying steady pressure to the tight muscles, which tricks them into relaxing. Since the pinched nerves usually occur between my spine and shoulder blades, it's very hard to reach them on my own. But it's hard for my husband to massage the spots for me, since he doesn't know exactly where to apply pressure, or how hard to press. The best trick I've found is actually two tennis balls in a knotted sock. I lean against the wall, sandwiching the tennis balls between the wall and my back. Then I bend my knees, moving up and down, rolling the balls along my back until they reach the spot I need to apply pressure to. And if that sounds awkward . . . well, yes, it is! It's hard to maneuver the tennis balls to the right spot and then keep them there. I've also tried a massage chair, which has hard, round bumps that rotate and move up and down to ""massage"" your neck and back. But the amount of pressure it applies is too much for me---It helps, yes, but I find it quite painful. For years, I've longed for a better solution. And I think I've found it with the Q-Flex.Basically, this tool is a question mark-shaped stick, with a foam grip to hold onto, and a hard ball-point on the other end. You angle the curved section over your shoulder, or under your arm, applying pressure to your back or neck with the ball-point. It allows you to reach virtually any part of your neck, upper back, lower back, etc. If you're interested in official acupressure techniques, it comes with a little booklet that shows you where to apply pressure for certain results. If you're more interested in stopping pinched nerves, muscle spasms, or knotted muscles, it can do that, too. Just place the ball-point anywhere you need it, then angle the handle and pull. You control how much pressure you apply, so you can make sure it doesn't get painful. It may take a little practice to figure out exactly where to place the tip and what angle to use, but you'll figure it out quickly.I love this product, but I'm a bit confused by the fact that it claims to be a ""Back and Body Massage Tool."" If there's a way to use it to massage your own back, I haven't figured it out. Seems like it would be painful to rub your back with the hard ball-point. Not to mention awkward. But if you want to apply steady, direct pressure to a specific spot to relieve muscle tension and spasms, it's truly excellent!I'll give the Q-Flex four stars and recommend it to anyone who suffers from muscle spasms or pinched nerves in your neck or back. You might check with your doctor to ask about the safest way to use this device, just to be sure you aren't doing more harm than good. I'm very pleased with the Q-Flex and intend to share it with friends and family members. (But they'll have to order their own, if they like it!)* Edited to Add (10/12/15): I figured out how to use the Q-Flex for massage! You just slide it up and down your back. I thought it would be awkward, but if you're wearing a t-shirt, it slides back and forth easily. Now, it's not as good as an actual massage from a person, obviously, but it does what it claims. Therefore, I'm adjusting my rating up to 5 stars.

"These are high-quality snaps. They're size 3, so they're fairly large. (At least, they seem quite large to me, since I'm used to working with doll-sized snaps!) Perfect for fastening a book cover, tote bag, purse, coat, jacket---anything that requires a large, sturdy snap. I bought them to use with crocheted neck-warmers, so they would wrap around the neck and stay in place without shifting, or having buttons pop loose. The snaps work quite well for that purpose.These happen to be black snaps, so they're good for use with dark fabrics or materials, especially if you don't want the snaps to be visible. The crocheted neck-warmer I made is dark teal, and I was afraid silver snaps would be too visible, so I opted for black.You get a pack of four snaps, with two halves each (male and female). They're sew-on snaps, which means you'll need a large needle and thread. I recommend using waxed thread, as there's less chance it'll break, or knot and snarl, while you're sewing. (To wax it, pull the thread through a cake of beeswax several times, until it feels a bit like dental floss. Fold the thread into a scrap of muslin and press with a warm iron. This melts the wax, fusing it with the thread.) Be sure to use thread that matches your fabric closely, so it won't be too visible.Very nice product! They don't pop open easily, even under strain. Indeed, it takes some effort to unsnap them. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a sturdy closure for clothing, home decor items, purses or totes, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GS4EOQ38ARX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YQGW34#wasThisHelpful","R34GS4EOQ38ARX","A1FYYHVUDAYU53","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FYYHVUDAYU53?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My friend is reading this, I haven't started yet. You can't go wrong with any of the Saint series though !!.He's a very interesting character to say the least, the love that he has for his wife and children is inspiring.I should be able to borrow the book in a couple of days. I prefer reading the book instead of kindle. Just me, being old school and different and cool with it.The book is Huge, since it's like 2 books in 1 so maybe kindle for most people is definitely the way to go on this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKQLYTBYWMWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482084015#wasThisHelpful","R1TKQLYTBYWMWQ","A3FNNJXYFA1BNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FNNJXYFA1BNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm enjoying this fragrance. Even if it doesn't last on me.I have a little ""trick"" I'm doing. I add a little of this to lotion- something inexpensive and faintly scented. It grabs on to this and helps it  stay on longer.If this perfume is evaporating on your skin like mine, try this, I hope it helps. this is light and smells like jasmine and a little gardenia to me.Don't add too much to lotion( if you're using my trick)  or skin since it can be a little ""loud"" and smell kinda like an old lady fragrance, so be careful.These are reasonably priced so try a couple and I'm sure you'll find something you like and experiment with it like I do.

"Hi fellow Amazon shoppers, I'm here to give a brief review and give a tip to anybody needing it.This perfume is nice, a little sweet but acceptable.  The only issue I have is ; it didn't last past 10 minutes on my wrist or neck.So I decided to add this to a very faintly fragranced lotion I bought at one of the dollar stores. It helped to grab the fragrance and help it last.I've had this on twice doing my little ""trick"" and the fragrance has lasted for several hours. I bought the roller bottle pictured, it's eayt to take off, just grab between 2 fingers and pull up from base of roller.These are cheap, and decent smelling- so it worth buying 2 or 3 just to get an idea of what works for you, you can even mix it with other oils or body creams or shea butter ect... just experiment.

"Excellent film !. One of my all time favorites, smart Amazon ;-))The theme song will stay with you a loooong time Fabian was great in this, Pretty boy Floyd wasn't killed where they said in this film, he was killed in a small town in Ohio, there's a monument of sorts commemorating this at the site.There's also, what I thought a very sexy bathtub scene in this film. It's tame by todays standards, however when I first saw this in the early 70's it was pretty hot.Don't be fooled by the fact that this is a low budget older movie, that it might not hold your interest.  It will.This  rates up there with Bonnie and Clyde for me, you just don't have the ""Superstars "" and huge budget behind it. This movie is for anybody who enjoys gangster/ bank robbers/  poor vs rich themed movies  This is a good break for anyone wanting action without buildings and cars blowing up every 5 minutes. Grab a beer or drink of your choice and a snack and escape with Pretty Boy.

"I really don't like to start a review on a negative note, however this one warrants such. Bayou Blue is sad, disturbing, and shows  what ails us as a society and nation.I saw and watched this film/documentary on another site before Amazon - I watched it out of curiosity mostly, also a young woman somewhere on the internet is searching for this- one of her relatives was a victim of serial killer Ronald Dominique who from 1997- 2006 raped and killed 23 men.I have watched Cajun Justice here on Amazon, much of that show was filmed in these small towns where most of the killings took place, in one of the episodes of Cajun Justice, a man did mention that there had been a serial killer in the area, he didn't mention a name, he looked  embarrassed.I think most people were just as shocked and surprised as anybody that such a person lived in their area and nobody had a clue what was happening or who the killer was.It's unfortunate that the only beauty or redeeming feature in this film is the natural beauty that is southeastern Louisiana.Most of the bayou's are dying and along with it a special way of life. Hurricane Katrina the BP oil spill after that, lack of other jobs in industry or otherwise, chronic poverty and lack of education- who's to blame?. There are many unanswered questions, this has the feel of a whodunit mystery,since you have to wait til half way through this film to get a brief , glance of the man who is shielded by police and shrouded in darkness, whimpering and head down. Too bad this man didn't seek mental help or have anyone to confide in, many lives would have been spared.Unfortunately this was real life, not a figment of a writers imagination and many people there in the bayous live with many real fears everyday, fear of losing their way of life and culture, fear of the erosion of the bayous, fear of corruption, fear of being forgotten and misunderstood. I think this documentary is food for thought on many levels. Persons judging or looking down on anyone in this film should take a good long look at themselves in the mirror, the persons interviewed on the film may not have cried on camera nor speak the Queens English or several other points made by some (rude and unfeeling, might I add) that were made.  However, they are the true survivors and in many ways stronger than many of us , who sit in front of our computers and write a review on these kinds of atrocities while others have to live with this misery every day. So think before you write something mean people, Karma is very real, and you may have to live the life you just made fun of on this film.

"Country Bob's is the best sauce ever!.You can't go wrong with this BBQ sauce, many like to add additional ingredients to their sauces-that's fine, just try this ""as is"" first.It's a really well blended taste good on ribs and chicken,  and Shish kabobs.

"""Night watch""  A&Es newest  crime/drama series aired January 22nd 2015; is reminiscent of COPS.Ten times more grit, hopefully it won't fall by the wayside as another favorite of mine filmed in Louisiana, Cajun Justice  :- (As the narrator informs us, "" the city of New Orleans receives as many as 1,000 emergency calls a night"". This show gives you a timeline of events.Fire, Police, and EMT's travel the dark alleyways and neon lit streets of N. O.  risking their lives to help and save others- come along for the ride--it's gonna be a long night !!.On a few past episodes, which all have been entertaining; not to mention  a few truly bizarre, "" Full moon rising""  follows EMT's on calls where a dog bites the tip off of a man's pinky finger ???!!.  the victim was sitting in a bar minding his own business, as he went to the bar to reorder a drink the dog bites his fingertip off. Fingertip nor dog were ever found.Meet Ashley ""she"" stops traffic to assist the emergency vehicles to make it through the thick pedestrian filled traffic of the French Quarter; in a black camisole and black panties a very visible bulge in Ashley's panties not to mention a strong back hand slap will let you know to proceed with caution.The episode of the machete wielding maniac who assaulted an innocent elderly man who told the man he had no money, he almost lost an arm, all he could tell police was he was Hispanic and he didn't  know the assailant.The show is filled with compassion and humor which makes this something I can watch occasionally, it is also not for the faint of heart or easily depressed.By the way there are SEVERAL happy drunks, and even a couple of happy shooting victims ??!! . There's even a guy from England who doesn't even know WHY or HOW he has ended up in NEW Orleans !!!. If my review has helped, please click yes below.

"Will this ever be available in PAPERBACK ?  Volume 4.  I'll give this 2 stars since Amazon requires at least 1I will let the person whom I'll buy this for, read on my device. They aren't technologically inclined.Yeh, I know some of you are thinking, ""how is this possible"" it's 2015?.  It is what it is,  everyone should still have a choice or option if they're interested in ""erotica"" and writers of this genre are limiting not only potential new readers but themselves in sales.

"Watching my wife in Jamaica was  well written and a pleasure to read.  The book was a 10 as far as the person whom it was purchased for thought. I  myself wanted to give this a 3 1/2 star rating, the reason being not that it wasn't an enjoyable read, as stated above it was. I just  find it a little disconcerting that there's a limited amount of erotic literature available with more than the amount of pages as the book just mentioned.I purchased the book above in paperback for someone who has no need or even knowledge of how a kindle device works, or many other things many of us under 60 take for granted.Ms. Kasari, I realize many of your readers are 20-30 year olds who will buy and read many of your short stories and move on to the next without  much of an afterthought.However you and other talented writers of your genre are doing yourselves a disservice by not making more print work available. I know for a fact, since the person I purchased the book for told me, they've read this book 3 times already. This book is cherished and appreciated deeply  and when the Kindle ,smartphones laptops ect are resting in junkyards or landfills or recycled into who knows what. Somewhere in the United States there will be a paperback book sitting lovingly in a drawer or shelf gathering dust and a reader long gone who treasured the memories relished.If my review was helpful, ESPECIALLY TO YOU, Victoria Kasari. click yes below.

"This was not the strongest or the best smelling Frankincense and Myrrh I've ever had. However it is very pleasant and I'm enjoying it.I think HEM makes quality incense and have no issue with their products, I find mixing this Frankincense and Myrrh with HEM  ""Good Fortune"" is a very special and compatible match. They feel balanced,  the spiritual with the earthly. Good Fortune smells like leaving a multi millionaires den and Frankincense and Myrrh is going to Church or a place for meditation.That's the beauty of incense, for me at least. creating the mood. In the times were living in, everyone needs a sanctuary. Hem incense don't cost a lot and they give you plenty of sticks for your bucks. I wanted to try the higher priced Frankincense and Myrrh here on Amazon, at the time I placed my order for this the other brand was ""currently unavailable"" and I'm glad, since this didn't disappoint and it was a better deal.

AND pleasantly surprised, NO TASTE.That thrills me, many times coconut oils have overwhelmed what  I've been cooking, this doesn't.I have done oil pulling, I also use coconut oil on my feet and softening my cuticles, this jar was bought for my kitchen cabinet.This is an Organic and refined coconut oil, for medium high heat.It's non-hydrogenated and best used for stir frying and since it's neutral flavored for baking. No refrigeration necessary.You can, of course, still use this for body care. Your hair will still benefit from using this product.

"I've been using this product for 15 years. I've been buying it direct from Botanic Choice.As stated by the previous reviewer, it's excellent to relieve congestion, this is what I use it for as well. I rub it on (JUST A LITTLE ) on the area I want concentrated relief. The chest area is good, The vapors/ aroma will rise once you're under the covers, so you really don't need to rub this in your nose. I also rub this on my shoulder and the relief is almost immediate.Yes, it's got the camphor smell since that's the main ingredient. It doesn't last as long as BEN- GAY (the smell) , and the smell will fade.However it works just as well as BEN-GAY and all other related products, at a MUCH lower price.I used this last night so it definitely is something I  recommend-- especially during the cold winter months.The added bonus, at least for me, is it helps you fall into a deep, restful sleep.

"I've tried this a couple of times since I've bought it (internally) It doesn't taste bad at all, kind of a no taste imo.I don't think it was my imagination either,  this is quite soothing, it's good for the system. I felt somewhat calmer after 2 day's trying this first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.  I 'll try a foot soak next. This is good for detoxing, great facials healing pretty much everything!.

"This never fails to entertain. This is my GROWN-UP show, since I watch a lot of mindless reality shows sometimes.Raylon is a lawman, key word is ""man, "" he's never met a woman, he didn't want to bed it seems....and he has bedded EVERYONE.There's plenty of action, intelligent plots and storylines. I'm glad they included Dewey Crowe's kin from Florida. It just get's better and better.If you haven't been following this show, you can become an Amazon Prime member and get seasons 1-4 free.

"This is NOW, my favorite reality show/guilty pleasure on t.v.Vince Isoldi is a likable person imo, this show doesn't look rehearsed. It's about as real as a reality show can get.I had read somewhere that A&E was cancelling this, I hope that was only a rumor!!, I hope they'll be back for a second season.His niece Sammi, ends up getting some kind of help. I hope she sticks with whatever is keeping her off the drugs. You can see that she is very loved.  If you liked the Sopranos, or any Italian American themed shows you'll enjoy this.

"I remember seeing Baroness Sheri de Borchgrave  on a Current affair, back in 1988 -89. I had several of these shows on vhs tapes. Ahhh the good old days!!. This was when Maury Povich was the host, decades before his  now famous "" YOU, ARE , THE FATHER !"" phrase on the Maury show.Sheri de Borchgrave  on the show was shown as an attractive, very shapely, fashionable and well educated woman who loved adventure.She came from a respectable background, and had an outgoing, passionate and warm persona. She married a tour guide first before the Baron.I also remember her saying her husband wanted her to seduce his sons --more to the point, take their virginity. I'm purchasing this book after this review, And Yes, I did give this 5 stars since I've stated I've seen Sheri on television and liked her personality, and her determination to not be denied what was  rightfully hers, HER TITLE. After her marriage fell apart , her husband's family ,the media in Belgium ect.. wanted her to vanish, that is why I am purchasing the book, to see what happened from that point onward. I DO know her husband committed suicide. I won't say anymore I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I will say in parting, if anyone wants to see what Sheri looked like in 1993 go on youtube and type in her name, she was on a Sally Jesse Rapheal show,  the other guest on the show --the blonde lady posted it.  I wasn't aware this book existed.Thank goodness for youtube and Amazon.  I hope there are photo's, Sheri's husband was 6'6 or taller, and handsome it's too bad he had mental issues... oh well, Sheri is a survivor, I look forward to finding this in my mailbox!!!. click yes below if my review helped, Thank you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QU7D9RGELYA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525936378#wasThisHelpful","R2QU7D9RGELYA4","A3FNNJXYFA1BNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FNNJXYFA1BNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Planters limited edition nuts, are great!!, I think they mean LIMITED to the holidays, so don't worry they'll be back.So nice to have during the holiday season  at home, for the office or even a gift for someone who likes snacks, these will be appreciated by most just be sure you don't give to someone allergic to nuts.  Check your local ALDI'S or Walmart. ALDI'S does carry these limited edition nuts and you'll save a lot. 1 can is $6.49 in my neck of the woods, just trying to save you a few bucks.

"I Purchased Eddie Coronado's first book Manifesting Millions, it was just o.k.I wanted to get to know you Eddie, what you're mindset was, what or who inspired you. ( I know many are thinking Money stupid)However, some are motivated to obtain wealth to save someone's life, they need money to pay the cost of treatment ect..So , since I didn't get anything out of the last book except  a lot of quotes from other authors, who's works were published in the last centurythere is nothing "" new under the sun"" , I'll have to pass on this.When I buy a steak , I want the meat not the bone. These in a ""Series""  type books don't feel right to me. Somewhat like a 1970's pyramid scheme.Oh yes, the "" law of attraction ""  metaphysics or anything else you call it works.  It's just that for my money I don't want a very thin paperback bookor series of wealth building info that is basically the same stuff rehashed.I would say for all of you that purchase this great, I hope you win.  For those of you still on the fence, wherever you're reading this review do a little more research for free, I know many of you really don't have money to keep purchasing these books, and you're really hoping and praying for the book that will be the answer to you prayers. Go to the library.Second-- Go on youtube,  type in ""millionaire continues to clean up after lottery win.""Also check out these on youtube: ""Powerball winner Paul White hilarious press conference after winning $149 million"".Canadian woman thrilled by $40 million lottery win.and last but not least, "" LEARN how to win millions on tlc. ""Instead of spending , especially during the holidays when money can be tight for a lot of people on this book. You might find something to make someone happy - here on Amazon, or yourself .  At the very least , you could add 2-3 more dollars  to that $9.99 cost of this book  and buy your family or co -workers a pizza and share the love !! that will make people feel good and feed them at the same time.

"The results will speak for themselves.I used this the first day I received it and said ""NO WAY'' !!. I had, key word ""had"" those parenthesis or marionette lines on my face.After just a couple of light fingertip taps of this cream, those lines disappeared. I'm not a 20 year old reviewer, 20 is not in my review mirror,  it's up around the bend behind a big boulder where you can't see it, if you catch my drift .This also moisturizes dry and over worked hands, I scrubbed out pots and pans after this past Thanksgiving dinner last week, if you've used abrasive cleansers and brillo pads and you've spent 1/2  hour or more in water you know what I'm talking about.It's really cold out now, and I normally need lots of lotion and/or hand creams not with this. You'll see just how small dabs will be sufficient to get smooth soft hands, your skin will be very moisturized and glow. I wish it was spf 30 .  I usually wear a make up containing SOME spf so I guess you can't have it all.This is a cream, yes a rich mousse like cream. It absorbs quickly and COMPLETELY and it's not tacky feeling.There isn't really a fragrance to speak of, to my mind,  once rubbed in it smells sort of like HONEY, which it contains so no surprise there I guess.I think I'd call this a unisex fragrance since it's so faint any guy's wondering if they should purchase this for themselves I say GO FOR IT.You can't beat this, I know once it's gone, ( that will be awhile since so little is needed).  I won't hesitate to buy more, it's a no brainer.  I'm TOTALLY pleased and in love with this product.  No need for any other moisturizers for my face or hand lotions.This has exceeded my expectations , I see there are several creams that are similar or claim to be, here on amazon.However, for my money I KNOW I  made the right choice.

"This is SOOOO on point !.EVERYBODY, and I mean EVERYBODY should love this, and I'm totally shocked no one has written a review on this?.I waited since I figured this would be a necklace  that would sell really well and sell out quickly or the price would go up....oh well on Amazon you never can tell. Anyway getting back to this, I don't wear it often but I've had several complements especially young men (I had 1 ask wear I bought it from).It's substantial feeling the chain isn't flimsy or lightweight, yet works for women. I wear this with the most feminine outfits to go counter what you'd expect to see someone wear. This of course will look good with black--especially leather, but try wearing it with ruffles or lace or pastel pink (which is big for fall/winter 2014) wear it paired with a choker.

"I bought this for a good friend (who doesn't like to shop online??!) She's in her late 5o's and said she's been using this since the late 60's (her mother bought it )it was the only pomade they used. She ""still"" has a tightly sealed jar of it from 1974 or 75 !. There's about 1/4 of the original product inside a regal pink jar. (NOT the plain pink jar pictured in the photos)  This 39 year old jar still had a pretty strong fragrance, I could even smell the difference. This smells ok just different. My friend said her old jar's smell held memories ,it  had an honest to goodness realness about it.She said this product had an old school feel that took her back to ""straightened"" vs afro, little girls wearing dresses, families eating dinner together, simple and good. She said since she's used this (she's had it a few weeks or more now) that it's perfumy, and weaker smelling, still she's happy since it's  a good conditioner.

"PERFECT FOR WARM, SULTRY NIGHTS.I LOVE , LOVE, LOVE,  BETTE DAVIS, and THIS is my favorite !!.YES, IT'S in black and white as well it should be, that helps to give it a scarier and more graphic feel.Also it's from the early-mid 1960's when films of this genre were shot mainly in black and white.

"HI Lovelies!!,I bought this top, knowing that I'd love it and so would my honey, it looks good, REALLY good.Now listen, if you've read any of my clothing reviews YOU KNOW: I'm 5'7 1/2 tall, over 160 lbs, my midsection could stand to losea few inches and my bust is 36-38 ish  C- cup. Now getting back to this top, I received 5 (five) complements from strangers, I don't count friends and family, I THANK THEM, however they know I'm my own personal stylist and a fashionista  who is always doing the"" MOST""  this blouse is sooo sexy, yet demure,  trust and believe  that. The lace is made well, not super thin flimsy lace that someblouses or dresses have,  My top was a medium I will definitely wash by hand so as to be able to wear several more times withouttorn lace (a possibility) or shrinkage.The flowers look a little larger, roses, just in case you weren't sure. As far as the fit, if your midsection is small/average the mediumwill fit to a "" T""  my fit was good, I think I need to lose some inches and it'll be better. The bust was tight yet comfortable. and I hadmore than enough room in the arm holes. I felt ease of movement and the material is soft even the lace.All in all this was worth the price, I hope this company comes out with more designs like this, you won't see yourself coming and going that's for sure.

"This is an excellent brush for blending powder eye shadow in the crease area, but it is not perfect.  It would be perfect if the bristles were slightly firmer and the brush head had a slightly narrower shape.  Just a tad, because you don't want overly stiff bristles, nor too narrow; you can buy crease brushes that are quite narrow.The fact is, the brush is great for blending, but I could get my eye makeup done faster with the aforementioned adjustments.  As it is, it's great if you're not playing beat the clock!I've also used this as a lid, and all-over eye area brush.  If you can afford only one eye shadow brush, buy this one.Though this brush is also easy to clean, once you've used it, it will never be white again.  It absorbs pigment and becomes stained with first use.  It's stained, mind you.  It isn't holding product.  If you use a gray eye shadow one day and a brown the next, the brush won't transfer gray in with the brown.The handle is a nice length, and it's well-balanced.  I heartily recommend it.  Just know it isn't a be-all, end-all brush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OEMS4T8W8TAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJYQEME#wasThisHelpful","R3OEMS4T8W8TAT","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This protein bar is supposed to be chocolate, almond, and coconut flavor.  The main flavor note is chocolate; occasionally I pick up on the almond and coconut.  This was a dire disappointment to me, because I love chocolate and coconut, and if there is almond, so much the better.I only bought one box, and I did finish it.  It isn't like the flavor is awful.  They actually taste pretty good.  They just don't taste quite as I expected.  The flavor and texture are quite pleasant, and I appreciate being able to find a protein source that isn't sky high in calories.Nevertheless, I experienced some gastrointestinal distress, the details of which I'll spare you, dear reader.

"I've decided I'm never buying makeup brush sets again.  I've bought several sets, and there is always something disappointing about them.  Just as there is always a color in a palette I will never use, so are makeup brush sets.  Always, there are unnecessary or poorly designed brushes.  Even Paula's Choice brush sets include clunkers.Last year, after reading rave reviews, I purchased BEST SELLING Professional 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set with Designer Case Plus BONUS Stippling Brush. Hand-Made Powder, Foundation, Concealer, Eye Shadow Brushes and More. Professionally Endorsed.  These brushes are good quality, but I only like the powder brush and one of the eye shadow brushes.  That didn't save me any money!  Essentially, I paid over forty dollars for a powder brush and eye shadow brush.  The biggest disappointment in that set is the blush brush.  It's too small, and it isn't round.This blush brush is meant for use with powder blush.  It looks and feels like it's made of luxurious animal hair, but in fact, the bristles are synthetic.  They are made with DuPont Natrafil, developed to perform like animal hair bristles.This is the yummiest makeup brush I've ever used, period.  The bristles are very soft, but sufficiently dense.  The brush picks up powder brush with the gentlest touch against the pan.  Blush powder doesn't blow around in the air.  It stays on the brush until I apply it to my face with a few quick strokes.  It blends perfectly.I've had this brush long enough to wash it twice.  It really doesn't need cleaning as often as my other makeup brushes, because the blush picked up  is deposited almost entirely on the face.  It simply takes longer for it to get dirty.  When I clean my makeup brushes, I fill my bathroom basin with a couple inches of water, and add a generous amount of CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.  I swirl the bristle ends of my brushes in that solution.  This brush gets clean faster than any other brush I own.  After washing, I refill the basin with clean water and swirl; then I repeat to make sure all the cleanser is rinsed.  I gently squeeze the bristles, and lie the brush flat on a paper towel.I've read that Natrafil brushes dry faster than brushes made from other materials.  I find this untrue.  This brush does take longer to dry than my other brushes.  But it's worth it to have the absolute perfect powder blush brush.  This brush far exceeds my expectations.  You will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UM2F297OWI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWQYY2W#wasThisHelpful","R32UM2F297OWI7","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always keep Fruit of the Eart Vloe Vera Gel on hand, because it's so useful.Unlike many aloe gels, this does not contain added colors, SD alcohol, menthol, or lidocaine.  SD alcohol and menthol provide a cooling sensation, but can irritate the skin.  Lidocaine is what your dentist injects into your gums to numb nerve endings for dental procedures.  I have used gels with lidocaine in the past, and it does help with the pain, but it will not help heal the burn.  Neither will SD alcohol or menthol.If you have mild sunburn, apply this frequently, stay inside, and stay cool.  Fortunately, this product can be applied as often as you please.  If your sunburn is moderate to severe, see your doctor.I use this for minor household burns.  Two days ago, I burned my forearm near my elbow while reaching into a 425 degree oven.  Right away, I ran some cool (not cold) water over the affected area, and started applying this gel every couple hours.  I also used a good moisturizer and sunscreen; more on those products later.  The burned area of skin is now brown.  There is no redness, no pain or irritation, blistering, peeling, or scabbing.  The skin is perfectly smooth and the mark will fade.It's also good for an array of minor skin irritations.  Sometimes when I'm handling plants and gardening, oils from the plant cause a bit of an allergic reaction.  I'm not talking about poison ivy types of reactions here, just itchiness with or without redness, without a rash.  It's quite soothing.  It also helps heal minor cuts and abrasions, those tiny injuries that happen while cleaning house or handling office items.I've used it in a pinch as hair gel.  It has no film formers or silicones, so it doesn't add hold or shine, but the thickeners will add some body to my hair, which is great, because my hair can use all the body I can give it.For both men and women this is possibly the best aftershave product out there.  No matter how you remove hair, you may experience skin irritation.  Depilatories, epilators, electric, and blade razors can all cause rash or razor burn.  Gentlemen, please get rid of aftershave products and use this.  Don't use aftershave products or colognes containing alcohol or menthol.  No matter what you've been told, these products are not good for your skin.  You may think the ""burn"" is a necessary part of a good shave, but you're wrong.  A good shave is the result of good shaving tools and techniques.  Those products burn because they irritate your skin, and the more irritation you have from shaving, the more they burn.  Otherwise, this is the first thing you should apply to your skin after shaving.Use styptic powder or pencil, or an alum block to stop bleeding if necessary.  Then, men and women both, use this gel first thing after shaving or other methods of hair removal.  Aloe contains potent anti-irritants.  It will soothe your skin, and help ease redness.  After using the aloe gel, apply a moisturizer, such as Cerave Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM, CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion, or ShiKai Lotion, Dry Skin Therapy, Gold Bond  Ultimate Restoring Lotion, With CoQ10.  You'll need sunscreen if you go outside.  I recommend Olay Professional Pro-X Age Repair Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30, EltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30+, Banana Boat Sunscreen Protect and Hydrate Moisturizing Broad Spectrum Sun Care Sunscreen Lotion - SPF 50, or Industrial Strength SunscreenISSC-8-30+FF SPF 30+Micro Refined Clear Zinc OxideFragrance Free.Finally, and yummiest of all, this is so marvelous for rubbing your feet.  Especially in the summer, when it's mighty cooling, sometime after you get home from school or work, get your dawgs out of your shoes and spend a few minutes massaging your feet with aloe gel.  It feels fantastic, and it isn't so messy as massage creams, lotions, or oils, or other moisturizers.  It's a dandy treat for your feet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NYKEOP1SOUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GION5I#wasThisHelpful","R9NYKEOP1SOUF","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's too bad the vendor doesn't let you choose a color package, but I like the colors I got.  The shirt fits as expected according to the size chart, but beware:  The arm holes are enormous!  They're cut well into the chest area, so you definitely don't want to leave the house wearing these shirts.I would hope you aren't planning to wear them outside the house, anyway.  I bought them to help keep cool on hot, humid days, and they're great for that.  And I don't have to worry about pit stains.....I actually like the fact that the armholes are so big.  Makes for a very comfortable shirt.I wash mine in cold and hang them to dry.  They're all cotton, but thin, and dry in a trice.  After several washes, one shirt started losing its hem thread.  I keep cutting it - don't pull.  It will just unravel more.They're really super to wear while doing aerobics or yoga.

It's a plant oil with medium viscosity, and it absorbs into skin fairly well.  I personally do not like the way it feels on my face, and I can't use it on my hair, because my hair is too fine.  I use this primarily after a shower.  I towel off my torso, step out of the shower, and put four or five squirts on each arm, and five or six squirts on each leg.  Then I rapidly rub it around on my wet skin.  It's a very effective moisturizer!Though packaged with a spray pump, the oil is to thick to spray.  It works more like a lotion pump.  I like the packaging, but it could be better.  An opaque bottle and airtight seal would have behooved me to rate this five stars.  I advise you to keep it capped and in a dark place when not in use to prevent light and air from breaking down the antioxidants.  There are no preservatives, aside from the antioxidants, so when you get it, use it.  The bottle will last a surprisingly long time.It's also a good spot moisturizer for very dry areas.  It's nice on feet at night, with socks so you don't mess up your sheets.  Don't oil your feet in the daytime.  You'll be slip-sliding in your shoes all day.  It's good on cuticles and those doggone dry patches on my knuckles.  If you do put oil on your hair or scalp, this is definitely worth trying.Whatever you use it for, you could buy a similar product at a higher price that isn't any better.  Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUU67IH8OAR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JTX3WI#wasThisHelpful","R1FUU67IH8OAR3","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a comprehensive stretching program divided into three separate workouts, approximately 20 minutes each.Each body part is stretched in each workout, and if you do all of the workouts, I daresay you'll have stretched every single muscle except your tongue and scalp muscles.  The workouts build upon each other, too.  What you do in the Easy workout helps you prepare for the Moderate workout, and you need to be capable of doing both of these to do the Intense workout.Attention is paid to the neck, shoulders, arms, wrists, fingers, chest, back, groin, glutes, all four major thigh muscles, calves, ankles, feet, and toes.  In 20 minutes, no less.  Many of the stretches are active stretches.  None are held more than a few seconds.  The Intense workout has some ballistic stretches.The Intense workout is somewhat aerobic, and successful practice of some of the moves calls for considerable strength.  The Easy and Moderate workouts are easy for me, but I have some difficulty with some of the moves in the Intense workout, primarily the backbend series that begins around one hour and three minutes in the streaming version.  Something to aspire to, though.I do the Moderate followed by the Easy workout at least twice a week, after an aerobic, strength, or yoga session.  Please note, you've probably done most of these stretches in some form in P.E. classes at school.  They are not exotic moves, and easy to re-learn.I do have a couple of quibbles, though.  There is a glaring error in the instruction in the Easy workout.  Following a lift-your-toe calf stretch, one knee is forward and bent; the other leg is behind you and straight.  Kim says to stretch the ""back hamstrings"".  You're not stretching your hamstrings.  You're stretching your calf.  If you try to stretch your hamstrings from this position, you'll hyperextend your knee.  So, watch out for that part.The other quibble is a bit more serious.  I've had my reasons to practice flexibility all my life, and I find some of the transitions too fast for my taste.  I can do them, but my form suffers.  For the person unacquainted with flexibility exercises, they could cause loss of balance or a strain, particularly in the adductors.Otherwise, this is a fine program for overall flexibility, and I do recommend it.  Be sure to watch each workout first, and if you have difficulty with the pacing, opt for skipping a move.  And remember, if you don't use it, you lose it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9PAGMD113NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0022M7C8W#wasThisHelpful","RG9PAGMD113NM","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This insect killer contains effective ingredients, and is priced right.  I like Ortho products overall.  It's generally a good brand.So I expected certain qualities, which this didn't deliver for me.  For one thing, the nozzle drips, and I mean excessively.  Every pull of the trigger dispenses spray, plus a substantial dribble of product that rolls down the bottle, and doesn't land anywhere you'd want it to.I shook the product before use, on a sunny, 77-degree day with 5 mph winds.  A perfect day.  The product rolled right off the leaves of my rosebush, as if raindrops were falling.  The product didn't stick to the rosebush at all.  That means the only way it will work is if it's sprayed directly on insects.  If it doesn't stick to the plant, it can't work systemically.  Unless that's why the nozzle drips - to let it fall to earth and be absorbed into the roots.  That doesn't seem likely.  And it's supposed to work on contact and systemically, but if it's not sticking to, or getting absorbed by the plant, it sure can't work systemically.I'm sure you can find another Ortho pesticide that will work for your flowering plants.

"This oil and emulsifier based cleanser removes all traces of makeup and does not leave skin feeling stripped.  It is an impressive makeup remover.I have issues with the aesthetics, though.  The first time I used it, I kept wondering when it would start to foam because it felt like I was still rubbing oil and water on my skin.  I finally opened my eyes and glanced in the mirror to find it was indeed foaming.  I can't feel it changing on my face or with my fingertips.  I've used it a good two weeks now, and that hasn't changed.  I know that after I add water, it will start foaming, but I can't tell when that happens.  It is impossible to rinse off unless I use a washcloth.  I can see the makeup is gone, but water beads up on my face.  I appreciate the softness, but I really don't like leaving cleanser on my face, so I scrape it off with a wash cloth.Yesterday, I noticed the ""Safe For"" symbol on the back of the bottle.  This symbol looks like a jar, and has a number followed by the letter ""M"".  This symbol is not on all cosmetic and personal care consumables, but I find it more and more often.  Unfortunately, according to the ""Safe For"" symbol on this bottle, the cleanser is safe to use for a mere three months after opening.  I think the average consumer will wind up wasting a lot of product.  Exceptions would be multi-user households.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8TST421V9QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTCRERK#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8TST421V9QN","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A dozen monkish thirty-somethings practice their disciplines in or away from their home base in Garrison Oaks.  Carolyn's practice is language.  Since her parents died, she's dedicated her life to learning languages.  Margaret's discipline is dying, Jennifer's is healing and resurrecting; Michael puts Dr. Doolittle to shame with his relationships with animals of the air, land, and sea.  David battles, and Peter studies mathematics.  Rachel predicts the future.  Almost all of their parents are dead, and they consider themselves a family because since they were orphaned, they have been under the care of and serving Father, a powerful enigma.Father becomes absent, and none of them know where to find him.  Someone has to take over and lead the family.  No one talks about it, but a power struggle and mayhem ensue.  Some of the family seem clueless.  Others, like Carolyn, are ruthless.Carolyn enlists an outsider named Steve to do her dirty work, and won't give him a break.  He winds up charged with murder, then escaping jail while being interviewed by a government agent named Erwin, who is badass defined.  What is not clear, and makes the middle of the book a compulsive read, is Carolyn's true motivation and methods.  This is one of the most creative story arcs I've read in years.  It's absolutely impossible, but completely logical.  For a fantasy.It's unfortunate that Mr. Hawkins did not maintain the urgency of the middle of the book through to the end.  I thought the story would end with a bang, but it ended in a soft, cozy thud.

"This toothbrush has very soft bristles and is well suited to brushing sore teeth or when gums are sore.  On the reverse are rubber nibs which can be used in a pinch.  Sometimes just one bristle hitting the wrong way can send one to the ceiling.  The nibs are not as effective at cleaning, but are certainly better than nothing when one cannot bear to brush.  The nibs work like a teething ring.  The toothbrush handle holds the gel, and has a large ergonomic grip.The actives in the pain relieving gel raise the pH on the affected tooth, and fill ""tubules"" in dentin and cementum.  Tubules allow air and water to pass through the tooth to the nerve.  Thus, the actives effectively block air and liquid from reaching the nerve, preventing pain from occurring.I like the toothbrush and gel very much, and recommend this product particularly when one is traveling and unable to get to a dentist should sensitivity occur.  The package instructions state the entire tube should be used.  This may apply for chronically sensitive teeth, but otherwise I would not advise using the gel for extended periods.  If sensitivity lasts more than a week, especially if new, one should see one's dentist.A toothbrush you should buy just in case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PIR8MFOU49V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCW6NR2#wasThisHelpful","R1PIR8MFOU49V","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I watered my dirt (too soon to plant!), and found this hose easy to handle.  It does not twist easily.  It's suitable for light to medium duty tasks.I hadn't thought about it, but the garden hose I have been using before I got this is 5/8"" diameter.  This is 1/2"" diameter.  Because of that, it does weigh less.  It also has a plastic anti-twist grip; my old hose has a stainless steel one, so that cuts down the weight, too.  But I think the plastic grip cuts the quality somewhat.For my own knowledge, I did some research and found that 1/2"" hoses deliver about 9 gallons of water per minute, while 5/8"" hoses deliver 17 gallons per minute.  If you're trying to limit water use, this hose will be helpful, but if you need more flow, it won't.This hose is for cold water only, so if you have a hot water pressure washer, you'll need a different hose.  This hose has very good burst strength.I find the connector dissatisying.  It is perfectly round and smooth.  My old hose is beveled, which means if it gets stuck on the spigot (yes, I've had this happen), I can use a wrench to loosen it.  That won't work with this hose.Since some hoses don't even have an anti-twist grip, and others have better grips and connectors, I'm calling this one in the middle.  I'd encourage you to think about what you really need from your garden hose(s), and try to get the best quality YOU need for the best price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22112TSAHR5O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6N9KI4#wasThisHelpful","R22112TSAHR5O4","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Amazon was kind enough to put all the buttons on the back of the device, so the surface is completely flat, with no cutouts.  A screen protector need be only the correct size to fit perfectly.This overpriced product is ONE screen protector, for front and back of the device, a bottle of soap solution, and a cloth.

"I remember vividly the first time I tried on a pair of Nike Air sneakers.  It was 1989, and the shoes were white leather with royal blue trim.  The price was $108.00.  I'd found a pair of Brooks I liked, but my husband kind of insisted I try these because the shoe sales person recommended them.  At first, I shook my head.  That's a lot of money for a pair of sneakers, and it was a boat load of money in 1989.  I tried them on just to get my usually cheapskate husband to shut up.He asked me how they felt.  I turned to him and said, ""They feel like little tiny elves made them just especially for my feet.""  We bought them, and for a while, I wouldn't buy ANY shoe but Nike Air.I had a change of heart primarily because the shoe stores that carried the full Nike Air line stopped carrying them, or went out of business.  I had to find other sneaker brands that suited me.  And I have found good sneakers, but nothing like Nike Air.This pair has fabric uppers and a minimalist build.  There are plenty of splashes of color, but no extraneous stitching.  The stitching in the upper is confined to the lace and tongue area, the strip of vinyl at the front of the toe box, which does not touch your toes if you buy the correct size, and bracing stitches at the back of the heel.The first thing I noticed when I tried these was how balanced my posture became, immediately.  I could feel my center of balance shift directly above my arches.  The air in the sole absorbs shock and provides cushion, but this is balanced against the function of the shoe.  The sole facilitates movement.  It is not minimalist thin like many running shoes on the market today, but it is not thick and clumsy.These shoes are feather-light and comfortable.  The tongue slips only occasionally.  This is a big plus if you find yourself constantly tugging at your shoe tongues because they've slipped port or starboard.  I've worn these shoes for twelve hours straight many times.  My feet may get a little tired, but the shoes don't make my feet tired.  I never feel like I must remove my shoes.The little elves are back!  Hands down, the best shoe I've ever purchased on Amazon.  Buy your true size.  I award these shoes the rare and coveted HB stamp of approval, my highest recommendation.And, if you know her shoe size, a wonderful gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUTX4LOVY3HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8QTSBA#wasThisHelpful","ROUTX4LOVY3HP","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I selected this straightener, I didn't realize it matches my John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer.  Good heavens, suddenly my bathroom looks like a salon!  This straightener is really pretty, and it is with a heavy heart I give it four stars because it tends to snag my hair.  A lot of straightening irons will do that, but my Remington S8500 Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1"" has never snagged it.Maybe I should just be more careful.  My hair is already straight, and admittedly, I'm in a hurry to give it a finished look on shampoo mornings.  This straightener offers many heat settings, which are displayed in degrees Fahrenheit.  These temperatures are to be used as guidelines.  I set it to 310 degrees; it might actually heat to 300 or 320.  Though they aren't exact, I prefer this display over the notched displays often found on multi-temperature styling tools.  That's irrational, but I don't think I'm alone.  I like the variety of heat settings and the display.It does heat up fast!  That's a plus, even though it's only a 15 second time difference from my Remington.  The 1.5 inch plates are very nice for all but short length hair.  And then there's the snagging, which occurs just when I flip my wrist (so maybe it really is me).  The plates meet well, and so far, I've had no issues with the cord tangling.The instructions state this iron should not be used with hair products containing oils.  I don't think this is a warning to not deep fry hair.  I think it is because the straightener can be heated beyond the smoke point for most oils used in styling products.  If you use this at a lower temperature setting, and clean it between uses, you should be able to use oil-based products.This comes with a sectioning comb that is like a rat-tailed detangling comb.  It is very functional, but it is not a finishing comb.This straightener is a Conair product with the John Frieda label.  Overall, I like it.  It looks great and has great features.  I think most people would be pleased with the results - I am, despite the snags.  It makes quick work of styling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QRFPJBGQ81T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FU1YQX6#wasThisHelpful","R21QRFPJBGQ81T","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"But not definition, which should not have surprised me.  The barrel is an inch and a quarter in diameter.  I didn't expect much in the way of curl from a barrel that size.  That's just unrealistic.What it does well is build a foundation for a hair style.  I get lots of oomph, and those with curly hair can tame the mane, which I think is a better idea than trying to achieve straight hair, because natural curls reform.I don't get much beyond volume.  A little bit of wave, but it doesn't last long enough for the time required to get it.  Getting any wave at all requires painstakingly sectioning hair, and very patiently letting it sit against the rotating barrel.I like that it has a few heat settings from which to choose, and it does not tangle my hair.  I thought it might, but even when I tried to tangle my hair with it, it didn't.My hair is straight and fine, so if your hair is different, you should certainly expect different results.  Do not worry about tangles or snags.  Do expect to spend a lot more than ten minutes styling your hair with it.  It seems to me this iron would work best for those with hair of medium length and thickness.The iron comes with a cloth to protect your vanity from the hot barrel.  The cloth is kind of a joke, in my opinion.  It does not provide enough insulation to keep your vanity from being marked, just enough to keep it from catching fire.  It's also rather small.  If you do buy this, I recommend resting the iron with the brush side against the vanity, and the barrel sticking up in the air.  It will rest that way, and that's a better bet than using the cloth to protect your vanity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27IQS1ISP5RJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5N5KZO#wasThisHelpful","R27IQS1ISP5RJY","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yowza, this little bit is quite the speaker!  It's lightweight with a slim profile.  The control buttons on the unit are self-explanatory icons.  It's very easy to use.  I'm sure even my dingaling sister could figure it out.The sound is crisp and clear, and yes, it WILL travel.  Please respect your neighbors, but not too much.  They might want to join you.  Up to five devices can be wirelessly connected, and if multiple devices are being used, you can set the device for two modes:  Heist, which lets users ""take over"" the speaker, or daisy chain.  Daisy chain (what an archaic term!) automatically passes the speaker from one device to the next.  Perfect for your pool party or barbecue.There is, thank goodness, an indoor mode.  The outdoor mode can knock you into next week.  Either way, you get great sound for a single speaker.  A great gift, no matter the listener's favorite genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C5DILU1V7OSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJI7WC4#wasThisHelpful","R3C5DILU1V7OSI","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a turquoise veil, size 72"" x 45.""  The color is beautiful, but the veil is heavily over-dyed.I use it as a head wrap at night.  I'm new at this, but am happy with the results.  My hair is shoulder length and straight.  If I do not plan to shampoo in the morning, I pull my hair up into a loose bun on the top of my head, or for curls, set my hair with Wrap Snap N Go Hair Rollers.  Either way, the veil-as-wrap keeps my hair in place while I sleep, and I spend far less time shampooing and styling.It is habutai silk, and very fine and somewhat sheer.  Mine arrived with a tiny hole that appears to have occurred in the weaving process.  It looks like some of the threads were too short or broke on the loom.  It's small and probably was not noticed in finishing.  If I was wearing it in public, it would not be noticed.I love silk, and this is a) reasonably priced and 2) real silk.  It's hard to tell online if what is described as silk is actually silk.  This is the real deal, and I may be back for more pieces.Back to the color:  Turquoise.  It is truly turquoise, like the Caribbean.  Because I use it for my hair, I must wash it occasionally because product builds up on it.  I've washed it four times, and every single time, my vanity sink has looked like the sea.  So, a word of caution if you plan to wash this item.  Have handy an old towel or shirt to absorb excess water (and dye) after washing, and clean the sink right away so it doesn't stain.  I drape mine over a wooden clothes dryer and it dries very quickly.  Despite the loss of dye, so far the color is still vibrant, and I am very pleased with this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PLSLL5MBVURY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB1PJR6#wasThisHelpful","R1PLSLL5MBVURY","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, a whey powder I enjoy!  Every whey powder I've tried has been thin and watery, no matter the flavor; and none has left me feeling the slightest bit full.  This mixes easily and has good viscosity, and my stomach says, ""Hey, that's food!""Texture:  As stated, this product is thicker than water.  This is because of the ground flax seeds.  I mix it with six ounces of water and toss a couple ice cubes in.  I let them partly melt, then remove them, stir again, and have a beverage with almost a pudding texture.  Still liquid, of course.  It isn't pleasant to view, I must admit.  When ground flax seeds meet water, they become mucilaginous.  So there is a trade off between visual appeal and texture, but it's worth it.Nutrition:  Flax seed is good for you.  It's a good source of dietary fiber, as is the oat fiber.  This product contains 20 grams of protein in a slim 110 calories.  It is low in fat.  Several vitamins and minerals are added.  So, there is a lot of nutrition in the drink.Other nutrition:  This product also contains coffee extract, white kidney bean extract, and raspberry ketones.  I know these ingredients have been ballyhooed for weight loss support.  I've never used any of them and have no opinion.  I am mentioning them for reviewing purposes.Flavor:  I am ambivalent.  It's pretty sweet, but does not remind me of any berry flavor.  It doesn't taste bad, but there is room for improvement.  Fortunately, one can easily dress up the flavor.  It can be mixed with milk or yogurt, and you can make smoothies with it.  A banana and/or some real berries would really knock the flavor off the chart.  Just remember, fruit has water in it, so you'll need to experiment to find your flavor/thickness balance.This is not a meal replacement, but if you add fruit to it or have some on the side, along with some grain, or perhaps some vegetables, you really can make a meal of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC5AARXJZ80BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6X3FU#wasThisHelpful","RC5AARXJZ80BD","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UNT Gentle Purity Makeup Removing Lotion is a true pleasure to use. Dispense some product from the re-lockable bottle and massage it gently into the skin. It feels like a rich lotion as it emulsifies makeup. Just massage it lightly, no need to pull on skin. Rinse with warm water. There may be some leftover mascara under the eyes, but otherwise, it's all gone. I love using this product. It feels fantastic on my skin. It is definitely my favorite makeup remover.This product contains some added fragrance, which may pose a problem for some. It seems to be a masking fragrance, and doesn't smell strong; the product has very little odor at all. Still, fragrance can be a problem for some. It has not irritated my skin.UNT recommends following makeup removal with their cleanser. I have not tried it. After I rinse, I gently wipe my face with a damp washcloth to dislodge makeup or makeup remover that may still be stuck to my skin. Actually, my skin feels clean. Some days I can feel a slight film. I use Cerave foaming cleanser after, to make sure all product is removed, but I wash my neck and chest anyway, so this is not an extra step.This product contains some good skin care ingredients, which don't stay on your skin, but kudos to UNT for including anti-irritants.The only issue I have with this product is its price. I had to pay more than I would like to get that luxurious feel. But it does work very well, and if your wallet can take the hit, I do recommend trying it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4TM0IECJXS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI371O0#wasThisHelpful","RM4TM0IECJXS4","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this brush to carry in my purse or have handy at my desk.I am pleased with the quality of the materials.  The brush, overall, is sturdy and durable.  The handle is very comfortable, and the bristles are densely packed.  It is purse size, so if you have very thick, long hair, don't expect it to perform like a full size brush; yet for its size, it smooths hair very well, and I like it a lot, especially for neatening my hair during the day.  My hair just goes where it goes.  The brush puts it back where I want it.The caveat is, the bristle ends are very sharp, and will scratch the scalp.  I have scratched my scalp with it, but it works so well otherwise, I just make sure I don't let it touch my scalp.  I have another brush at home I can use near my scalp, but it is far too large to carry around.A good brush, but I would not use it on a child's hair due to the scratch factor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVRZO1OB77JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EC6RMKY#wasThisHelpful","R3GVRZO1OB77JB","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't you find it difficult to find a comfortable pillow?  I do.  Even if I go to the BB&B and squish them in my hands, and actually try them out lying down, I never feel certain.  Buying pillows is like rolling dice, and I hate to gamble.I prefer a big, fat, soft, king-size down pillow.  The one I use right now set me back over a hundred, and I don't regret a penny.  My head is the comfiest bowling ball on the planet.I'm also a bit on the fence when it comes to memory foam.  Sometimes it is too hard or soft, or collapses too easily.  But, enough of my Goldilocks syndrome . . .This pillow is definitely firm, and it does not feel like my head is sinking in, but it does, slowly.  And once it settles, it is settled.  No rolling around or slipping off.  This pillow is a good candidate for those who use CPAP, because the head is kept still.  You know you hate when the mask just about pulls your nose off your face if you move your head a bit!  But your head is unlikely to move if you use this pillow.  It does stay cool, too.  I'm a sweat head, but not with this pillow.The first time I tried this pillow, I just wanted some quiet time for about twenty minutes.  I woke up an hour and a half later.  I'm not a napper, but it happened, and I felt surprisingly refreshed.  This is now my travel pillow.  It's heavy compared to my down pillow, but it's not as heavy as I thought it would be.If you like a firm pillow, and want some stability, you'll like this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204VO9RN8ERI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043L17NG#wasThisHelpful","R204VO9RN8ERI4","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Applique does not an absorbent towel make, but these are mighty attractive towels for a guest bath or for staging one's home for sale.The towels are quite white, the appliques and trim are shades of blue and beige that speak of sea and sand but are not <shudder> beachy.  They are classic colors and easy to work into a color scheme.  The towels look lovely in a bath with an interesting but neutral shower curtain.  You don't have to create your decor exclusively from this line.The towels themselves are 100% cotton, made in Canada; the decorative touches are added in the USA.  The cotton terry is good overall.  It is neither thin nor plush.  The hand towel I received had a snag in the terry loop.  Fortunately, I found and clipped it.The bath towel should be placed in a laundry wash bag because the threading for the shell beading will likely fray eventually, causing pieces of this decorative trim to fall off the towel. A laundry bag will help protect the threading in the washing machine.  The towels should be dried on a low setting to keep the appliques from shrinking.  The bath towel and laundry bag should be removed from the dryer while still damp and hung to complete drying.  I have a lot of beaded garments I wash and wear, even though they're labeled dry clean.  The real problem with beading falling off happens because of dryer heat.These are best used as decorative towels.  They would make a lovely gift for someone's home, for Christmas, or new home owners or renters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I3ZFO8LV861B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P1HXZK#wasThisHelpful","R2I3ZFO8LV861B","A3IOCPLIMYDBCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IOCPLIMYDBCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The nutritional profile of theSouth Beach Diet Protein Fit Bar, Dark Chocolate Coconut with Greek Yogurt Coating is similar to other brands of protein bars at the approximately 200 calorie mark.  That is, the protein and fiber are there.But there are many brands of protein bars in the 200 calorie range, and all make different flavors.  There is no problem finding a protein bar.  The problem is finding a protein bar one likes.  I've tried lots of brands, marking them good or bad in my mental list after tasting them.  There is some logic to my method, and everyone applies it to foods of comparable nutritional value.  I'm talking about things like peanut butter, cereal, bread, nut and soy milks, to name a few.This review is entirely subjective and based on my experience and opinions.  This is the very first South Beach Diet product I have tried.  I tried it with an open mind because I do eat protein bars, and I really like coconut.  I had no bias for or against the brand, and still don't.So let's get to it.  Yes, I can taste coconut.  After I finish chewing and swallowing, I can feel the little dessicated bits of coconut in my mouth.  It's definitely there.  Yes, there is dark chocolate, though I find it a bit more subtle.  Then there is, well, the other stuff, which tastes and has the crumbly texture of stale marshmallow treats with little or no sugar.  I find the taste and texture as a whole unappealing, and that is why I rate these bars two stars.Others may find these delightful, but I don't.  They are worth trying to see if you like them yourself.  I won't be trying these again.

"These slippers have a durable sole that will take you to the front porch, or inside the garage, but I wouldn't walk around outside in them. They are comfortable, but they are not the sturdiest. This type of footwear is not ideal for wear in the great outdoors, anyway. The slippers are built for comfort, not support.The packaging states these slippers are made a little wider for greater comfort. They are a little wider than Isotoner slippers I've purchased in the past, but they are not sized wide. Those who wear a wide or narrow size shoe will not be pleased.I wear a size 10 shoe, and was a little leery of a 9.5/10, but they fit me well. If you wear a 9.5, you may find them longer than you'd please.They deliver comfort with a very cushiony insole, one-piece slide, and stitching to hold that nice, soft microterry cloth in place over the cushion and bottom sole.These slippers are machine washable. Hallelujah! I hate wearing dirty slippers! So you might want two pairs. Do not put them in the dryer. They must air dry, and that takes some time, so if you have two pairs, you'll not be without the comfort.I like these very much and recommend them with absolutely no reservations. I offer only this bit of advice: Don't expect them to last for years. That nearly pillowy insole, which is why you want them, is going to break down and flatten out. This is not exclusive to Isotoner. Every pair of slippers I've owned that has a deep cushioned insole has broken down. It's the nature of the material.Unless you have narrow or wide feet, expect to truck around the neighborhood in them, or want slippers that will last until the end of time, these are for you.

It includes emollient and moisturizing ingredients, though if your skin is very dry, you'll want to apply moisturizer first.  It absorbs into the skin very well, and feels much lighter than most sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones.Speaking of water-resistant, I often find this type of sunscreen unpleasant to reapply.

I'm not sure what's going on - but it will boot like a dream once, and then on the very next restart my BIOS will claim that no bootable drive exists.This is not a loose connection as I can replicate this even if the computer is in exactly the same position - and I have seated the cable as tight as it can go.I've seen rumblings of SATA 2 / Sandforce compatibility issues - but I'm not certain if that's what's plaguing my drive.##################################I replaced the second hard drive of a 3 year old laptop, with this SSD. Overall the process was relatively easy. The drive fit nicely into my existing drive's mounting bracket, and slotted in with minimal fuss.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRV334RRN2ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDO3KEG#wasThisHelpful","R1BRV334RRN2ZQ","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 05/09:Please see the first comment below to allow the running of Google Play store apps on the phone. I have not tried this myself - and it's probably too adventurous for me. Fortunately a much simpler (but limited) alternative is to use the instructions at:www<dot>cnet<dot>com<slash>how-to<slash>the-easiest-way-to-install-android-apps-on-bb10This limits you to the apps available on the Amazon app store, but I was able to get Temple Run 2 up and running without breaking a sweat :)Original review:I was very excited to get a chance to use the new Leap. As a Crackberry addict from a number of years ago, I have since found my sweet spot with Android phones, and iOS tablets. While this device does recapture some of the mojo of its storied pedigree, it unfortunately did not arouse any strong urge to chuck out my existing devices.Ergonomically++ it feels solid in my hand, and looks like it will take hard use well++ its dimpled rubberized backing feels secure even with one-handed operation++ its buttons are easy to reach and operateAudio/Video:++ its speaker sounds lively and crisp - though not quite as luxurious as the awesome HTC One.++ its 5"" screen with 720p resolution is gorgeousProcessor:++ I was never hindered waiting for applications to start, or for videos to start playing on YouTube.OS:++ OS 10 is intuitive - it is swipe based (up to close an app, down to show its settings, etc.) I was never hindered trying to figure out how to do something.Camera:++ auto HDR that actually works!Battery:++ seems to last forever - with light to normal use, easily lasts me 24 hoursKeyboard:++ Keyboard mechanics work well using swipe based actions (down to display special chars, to left to delete a word); and positioning the cursor is simplicity itself (click and drag); and supports traditional Shift-drag text selection.++ word completion works well. As you type, the keyboard displays various autocomplete choices that you can drag to the edit box.Browser:++ worked well for my usual sites, and even handled Flash video on web sitesSo why not a full 5-stars?-- While the phone comes with staples such as apps for YouTube and Maps, Blackberry World lacks many apps that have become essential for me - including Netflix, Pandora, WeatherBug, Flipboard, etc. While one could argue that this is not the phone's fault, it does limit what the phone can do for you.-- The keyboard lacks visual feedback when Shift key is pressed (though the Shift Key itself does change). This is annoying, especially when you can't see what you are typing (e.g., with mixed case passwords)In conclusion, if you can live with the limited app store, then this is a very capable phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XCIG7YIYB71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UH9AMKM#wasThisHelpful","R22XCIG7YIYB71","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This keyboard is an absolute joy to use. It is the most authentic that I have encountered in over two decades - no exaggeration - the key travel distance, the perfect firmness, and texture simply put my mainstay Logitech G110 to shame. I type a lot (in the order of pages each day), and this keyboard feels excellent, with hardly any fatigue.Everything about this keyboard feels like a craftsman product - it is about three times as heavy as my G110, the keys don't feel the least bit plasticky, there's a satisfying (and very audible) click on each key press, and even the cabling looks industrial grade.The backlight on this keyboard is really cool with different brightness levels and even a couple of blinking modes (though that's probably an acquired taste). There's even a unique mode that lights up subsets of keys (such as only the WASD keys).I do miss the macro keys and the volume control wheel on the G110, but the FN-based volume control works reasonably well here.Note that setup was simplicity itself - it needs two USB plugs - one for the keyboard, and the other for it to act as a USB hub; and jacks for a headphone and mic.In summary, this is my new favorite keyboard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZL7GOR1VKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1SKM7U#wasThisHelpful","R2FZL7GOR1VKT","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not one to be excited by kitchen hardware, but this one impressed me right out of the box. It has the heft and feel of solid steel, and it looks like it will go the distance even in our busy kitchen.Planning#######I am not a particularly handy individual, and I was very nervous about tackling this project. Nevertheless, armed with a couple of YouTube videos, and a helpful spouse, I decided to give it a shot.The project was complicated by a number of factors. We were dealing with an under-mount sink, we only had two holes cutout in the counter-top, and these holes were very closely spaced. Our solution was to do away with the base plate and mount the faucet flush to the counter, and to install the handle on the left hand side.Fortunately, the Wexford was flexible enough to meet our constraints. And, this handle position worked out great for us because we normally use our left hands to turn it, anyway.The only concession was that the Grohe brand imprint ended up on the reverse side of the faucet, and so is not visible - but that's not something I'd lose sleep over :)Installation#######After getting together a couple of adjustable wrenches, some plumber's tape, and a screwdriver set, we decided to tackle this project.About 15 minutes later, we had removed our old Kohler, which ended up looking very pitifully scrawny next to this behemoth of a faucet. Truly, its pictures do not do it justice - this faucet is a monster!Sadly, the instructions were a little unclear in places - putting us into ""figure-it-out"" mode every once in a while. For instance you need the provided plastic shim only if your counter-top is less than 1-3/4"" thick, but the manual is very ambiguous on this point. Likewise, the fact that you need the cylindrical washer when not using the base plate, was not clear enough for the brain dead (like me). Nevertheless, none of these were show-stoppers, just annoyances - and we worked through them.We also struggled to install a loaded soap dispenser - but learned later that it would have been far easier to install it empty, and then fill it from the top. Well, we'll keep it in mind for the future.In the end, it took us about 2 hours before we were done - mostly due to both a severe lack of skills, as well as a severe lack of space (and an abundance of sharp edges) under the sink.But, luck favors the (stupid and/or) brave, and we had a bright shiny new faucet to show at the end of it all.Usage#####Once installed, the faucet is a dream to use - the handle and spout have a silky smooth action, and the faucet feels rich and luxurious. Its weighted sprayer works great and has 2 options - a solid flow and a spray. And, the soap dispenser works with a very smooth spring action.The Wexford's finish is supposed to make it very easy to wipe off limescale - which will be useful for us, as we have very hard water.I'll have to report back on how well this stands up over time, but so far this looks to be a solid product - both from a mechanical and aesthetic standpoint.~A_E~PS.

"Simply put, this monitor is a gorgeous monster:++ 27 inches of real estate are a luxury - no need to choose which windows to display!++ text is crisp and clear, and the colors are natural and vibrant.++ all of 2 million pixels ... and not a single dead or stuck one!++ anti-glare screen works great without any noticeable sacrifice of contrast/colors++ aesthetics are stellar with barely visible branding, and a nice thin bezel.Even the LED light is not directly visible - you only see its reflection in the base.And if even that bothers you, you can turn it off in the menus!++ Tilt adjustment works fine - though you have to be careful you don't tip over the whole display++ lots of adjustment potential, with menus for contrast/brightness, color temperature (presets as well as custom adjustable RGB values).++ setup is very simple - power on, connect, and it automatically the input to use.++ excellent shipping - arrived without any damage.Unfortunately, there are also some negatives.-- it sits literally about 1 1/2 inches off the table. Fortunately, a ream of printer paper cured that for me.-- its base is simply too unsteady for 27 inches of goodness. It picks up the slightest vibration - such as when I'm typing this review.-- speakers are pointless. I get better bass and volume out of my laptop's speakers. No exaggerations.-- no HDMI! seriously! And no DVI cable supplied either. I had to dig up an old DVI-HDMI cable that I had lying around.Overall, this is a 5-star display with a 3-star base giving it 4-stars at best.I wish monitor manufacturers would realize that they have currently have monstrous displays resting on plastic stalks. This is simply not workable, and requires investment in VESA-mounts for active users. I touch type, and I can see the monitor sway with every keystroke (though it is fortunately, barely perceptible.)I also almost deducted a star for the lack of HDMI - none of my machines currently have a DVI output, and I wish ViewSonic would get with the program.~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTT2IBOX8WQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0NW4FW#wasThisHelpful","R1UTT2IBOX8WQ8","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The PJD6345 is a decent projector with:++ excellent brightness and sharpness,++ low noise,++ loads of connectivity options (VGA, HDMI, and USB.)++ decent room filling mono sound from its built-in speakers (16W)++ a decent 3 year warranty (though, as expected the lamp is warrantied only for 1 year.)The weakest link on this projector is, very oddly, its power plug. I have never encountered a plug that was so easy to dislodge, thereby turning off the projector at the slightest jerk.I was also disappointed with its choppy playback of a AVCHD file from a flash drive connected to its USB port.Ergonomics were not great either - there's only one center-front height adjustment (I prefer having one on either side to allow for sloping surfaces), and adjustment is slow as it needs to be unscrewed rather than a one click release (as in many Epsons.)Note that its throw distance can be challenging especially if you need large diagonals in a confined space (e.g., 14 feet for a 100"" diagonal.)Finally, its resolution is only XGA which means the picture is stellar up to until about 60"" diagonal. While resolution was not a problem for standard text/graphics style presentations, no one is going to mistake this for a home movie projector.I did not have a wifi module so I was not able to verify the limitations identified by the other reviewer. However, connected via HDMI, I encountered no issues whatsoever - whether it was firing up a presentation in a conference room, or whether playing a training video. As long as I was careful about not jostling its power cable, this projector handled well, and my audience had no complaints.In short, this is a decent projector without much to rave about - hence the 3-star, It's Okay, rating.Happy Viewing!~A_E~","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9SDFZ3EZZQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBM01UA#wasThisHelpful","R3B9SDFZ3EZZQV","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I tried out, and returned, the HVLF60M - a strobe that overheated way too easily for my style of shooting (I tend to bounce at full power - and the 60M stopped after less than 2 dozen exposures.)I tried the Metz Mecablitz but the need for an adapter was a constant source of discomfort.Fortunately, the F43M is a much better alternative. It provides excellent exposures, and does not overheat (at full power) until about 42 exposures - which is almost enough for my demanding needs. (Turns out I've been spoiled by Canon.)It provides excellent exposures, its cobra head is the best innovation in strobes, and its TTL exposures are spot on.Obviously, this is not as powerful as the F60M, but the lower weight and smaller size are definitely welcome. This makes it particularly suitable for smaller form factor cameras - such as the NEX-6.Overall - highly recommended.~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPOWGVQ6A7F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQI00EY#wasThisHelpful","RQPOWGVQ6A7F2","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Asus TF103C has some very strong positives:# a stellar display - very sharp, very bright, and very colorful (despite its middle of the road pixel density)# a solid heft to it - way above its price-grade.# quiet good looks - with a brushed aluminum finish and a rubberized exterior# app performance that is zippy where I never have to wait for anything.# an awesome keyboard and touchpad.In particular, the touchpad works very well - with even scrolling and clicking support; and the keyboard is comfortable to use, with numerous hard buttons for common functions such as entering settings, and back/home navigation.Unfortunately, the docking mechanism is the TF103C's Achilles heel - and the only reason that this tablet bundle did not get a full 5 stars.First, docking is not intuitive. Even after days of near constant use, I still have to pay attention to aligning it just right - it has not become second nature.And, second, the angle of the tablet to the keyboard is about 110 degrees. This makes it hard to use when your eye line is looking down at the screen (e.g., when standing up.) This also means that the keyboard cannot be folded back to return to an impromptu tablet - say to view something in portrait mode. The only option is to undock - which means you now have to deal with an extra piece of furniture.Despite those minor quibbles, I love the TF103C - it is a joy to use, and everything works just like it is supposed to.This tablet bundle is a winner!Happy Computing!~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDCM8XV785WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOI6FZ8#wasThisHelpful","RKDCM8XV785WG","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something awe inspiring about any router that has so many antennas - and the WRT1900AC did not disappoint.This router launched to very high expectations. It was to be the modern-day successor to its hall-of-fame older sibling - the WRT54GL - which I reviewed here years ago :)Coming almost a year after Belkin's purchase of the Linksys brand, there was also a lot of anticipation (mine included) as to the future of a venerable brand (remember the ill-fated merger of Chrysler and Mercedes?). After a singularly bad experience with a previous Belkin router, I had personally chosen to stay away - well, until this one.I recently had a chance to get familiar with Fluke Network's AirCheck wifi tester, which has a uniquely useful Survey feature that works great for testing routers. I used this to get a baseline from my WNDR4700, and compared it with the results after switching to the Linksys.My findings?Setup was painless - I unhooked my Netgear WNDR4700; moved its Ethernet cables over to the WRT1900AC; rebooted my cable modem; and powered up the new router. I connected via the Ethernet port to the WRT1900AC, configured my wireless networks to their original settings, and I was done. Yes - it took about 10 minutes, and most of that was spent fishing a cable that I managed to drop in the most inaccessible area behind my office desk.The WRT1900AC also provides a smashing device network map that is a spectacular improvement over the anemic options previous routers sported, and its user interface has also been greatly streamlined.It also performed far better, or even more important - more consistently, than the older WNDR4700 that it replaced - in both the 2.4 and 5-GHz bands.AirCheck's Survey mode provides heatmap-like graphical views of signal strength (dbM) and throughput (Mbps) across both frequency bands. After a long weekend where I painstakingly drew up an architectural map of two floors, I was ready to go. For both routers, I measured signal strength and throughput in common usage areas (such as my entertainment center, my favorite couch, etc.) In both bands, the Linksys comfortably bested my older WNDR4700. Visually this appears as a single tone color across most of the floor for the Linksys, whereas it is a patchwork quilt for the WNDR (I have a few known dead zones that I've patched using a wireless access point.)As for reliability, so far it has been stable and I have not had any noticeable reboots or disconnects.This router does get fairly hot - despite its well ventilated case and internal fan. But then, this router has a processor that is about as powerful as my desktop tower from the mid 90s :)Note that I do not intend to use OpenWRT/Tomato/etc. so I cannot speak to that controversy.Happy Networking!~A_E~Setup Tips:1. Use WPA2 encryption, with a password that is at least 8 characters long (12 preferred)2. Turn off UPnP and WPS unless you explicitly need them (there are security issues associated with both.)3. Change the router's admin password right away (the default is ""admin"")4. The DHCP server is configured to start at 192.168.1.100. I changed this to the traditional range as I have memorized the reserved addresses for a number of devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM77RU4QPYCNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KEK4Q5Q#wasThisHelpful","RM77RU4QPYCNP","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those rare products that not only does everything that it is supposed to, but does it with style. It had the entire family ooh-ing and ah-ing from the moment I took it out of the package (it is aesthetically very pleasing.)So what works well:1. Amazing software.A product such as this can be decimated by poor software, but Epson's team must be congratulated on releasing truly production-grade software. There are apps for every major platform out there (iOS, Android. Mac, Windows) and the versions I tested (Android, Windows 7 x64) worked flawlessly, and were absurdly easy to use. I could add borders, print photos (albeit grainy and monochrome), choose from custom graphics, edit my own text, and much more. Note that the PC software has much more functionality than the mobile apps do.2. Build Quality.While it is made of plastic, no corners were cut in its production. This is one solid product, with hard no rough edges, and even the tape door closes with a nice satisfying thunk. With proper use, I can see this lasting a very long time.3. Aesthetics and Design.Its aesthetics are stunning - looking more like a retro cassette-tape player than a label printer. And small touches abound - like the slightly inclined buttons that are easy to press from above, the windows through which you can see the currently installed tape, the attractive color scheme, and even the non-skid feet!4. Setup.On both the Android and PC, setup was easy and painless. Literally taking less than 3-5 minutes each.5. Print optionsWhile the consumables for this printer are not cheap, I was pleased to find a wide assortment of labels already available. There's tape for various widths (up to 1"" wide), color combinations (incl. high contrast black on yellow), and materials (ribbons and fluorescent backgrounds.)6. Label print qualityWhile I was very impressed with its overall print quality - it was the printing on the ribbons that blew me away - producing store quality results right at home. The adhesive on the normal labels was also decently strong.7. Multiple power options (electric outlets + 6 AA batteries)I love the fact that this can be powered by batteries - adding greatly to its overall versatility.To conclude, the LW-600P does not take a wrong step. It has all its bases covered - in terms of a quality product, software, and consumables, which translates to more than just a functional product - this is a product that is actually fun to use.I found my only wish-it-would-work item when I tried connecting to the printer from my Bluetooth-enabled notebook. Unfortunately, the software insists on a USB cable connection. Hopefully this will be addressed soon.As with any product, there's a risk that this will keel over and die, right after I've finished gushing about it. But, from all that I have seen, this is going to be a fun new addition to our home, and I expect to enjoy it for a very long time.Happy Printing!~A_E~","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKUDBRLUYZBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IL7BJMM#wasThisHelpful","R1LKUDBRLUYZBY","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is one of the most versatile binders I've ever used - with pockets galore, a nifty handle, and a very professional look. In fact, this new folder is so generously sized that it has replaced multiple folders that I used to carry my stuff around from one meeting to the next.My favorite feature would be its two accordion files (one outside the binder and one inside) that come complete with tabs.

"This is a point and shoot with a difference. I was able to shoot a video, view it on Windows MediaPlayer, and download it using a web browser on my computer - all in minutes!Unfortunately, to do this you need a veritable degree in computer networking, and there were a number of dead ends. However, if you are patient, this camcorder will reward you with an amazing amount of functionality - as long as you acknowledge that there are a few rough edges.Let's start at the beginning.I recorded a robin catching a worm, at full zoom, and the video capture quality was unbelievable - even eliciting a wow! from my spouse. The colors were bright and the video had great contrast. In addition, the sharpness was excellent - with each blade of grass and each leaf coming through. Definitely, far better than I had expected for this price point.Of course, this was recorded at the highest quality that this camcorder supports - AVCHD 60P, which gives a paltry 30 minutes of recording time using the built-in 8GB of memory. With a Samsung 32GB SDHC memory card installed, this expanded to a decent total of about 3 hours.(Note that you can use the Relay Recording feature to seamlessly skip from the internal memory to the SD card once the internal memory fills up.)I copied the recorded video to my computer simply by connecting it via the provided USB cable. Both the internal memory as well as the SD card appeared as drives in Windows Explorer (Windows 8.1 x64), and I was able to navigate down to the folder that contained the video recordings (.MTS files.)An alternative approach to transferring files is to have the camcorder setup a private network, to which your computer connects. I was then able to use a standard web browser (Chrome) to download files from it (a 330MB 12 min video took about 2 mins to download).Interestingly, the HFR50 can even act as a DLNA media server - allowing Windows Media Player to stream media off of it. The only caveat is that your network must have the bandwidth to support full HD streaming (about 27Mbps).I was also impressed with its touch screen interface - clicking was accurate, and it even supported smooth scrolling!Note that the CameraAccess Plus app was not compatible with my Android smartphone - so I was not able to try it out. Likewise, I am leery of installing additional software on my workstations - so I did not care to install ImageBrowser EX (for handling MP4 video and pictures) or Transfer Utility LE (for transferring AVCHD video.)One annoying feature is that the lens cover does not automatically retract when it is powered on. Instead, all you get is a reminder to open it manually. Another slight downside is that its LCD is very reflective, making it hard to view in bright conditions.In conclusion - this is quite a well-featured camcorder but only as long as you are willing to invest in learning how to use its features, and as long as you are not put off by some rough edges.~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCIMI4SG4L2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLDFT6Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UCIMI4SG4L2F","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently had a chance to review the Midland ER300, a very capable all-in-one product (weather radio, crank AM/FM radio, flashlight, charger, dog whistle, SOS light, etc.)I was very eager to compare that Midland with this new option from Cobra, particularly because of its portability.At first glance, this is a very handsome radio - with a bright color scheme (contrasty black and yellow), a rubberized grip, a solid antenna, some weatherproofing (it survived an accidental lake dunking), and a convenient belt-clip/lanyard. Turning it on, I found the sound very audible and clear (better than the Midland.) In addition, it can charge other devices (micro USB output) and has a built-in flashlight. It has the same form factor as a regular FRS walkie-talkie, and I found it fairly comfortable to hold and use. Programming it was very straightforward as well, it took very little time to setup the SAME station for our area, and enabled alerting.I also liked the attention to detail - where the designers allowed the annoyingly loud beep on button pushes to be muted; its Tornado mode - which only goes off for tornado warnings; and its Wx Weather Alert - which lets you temporarily turn on all alerts when traveling outside your SAME areas.Unfortunately, it has two big problems, which ended up being deal breakers.1. It refused to alert even when the ER300 was blaring away. I verified that it was receiving the exact same NWS station as the Midland.2. It refuses to charge up its batteries even while placed in the cradle. Once full, the charger turns off until the battery is depleted. I leave the ER300 connected and charging at all times.Both of these should be easy to fix - and hopefully Cobra will address these in newer units. However, as it stands, I am unable to recommend this unit.~A_E~","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N91SMB0L5RWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZGWTVO#wasThisHelpful","R1N91SMB0L5RWT","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very attractive binder - one that my daughter fell in love with, the moment she saw it. The image is cheery (springtime with a bird on mine) and even the interior is filled with a fleur-de-lis style pattern. Unfortunately, the one I received came pre-installed with a couple of blemishes (almost like extra glue left over) on the cover that detracted from the image.The only other noteworthy feature is that the cover is fairly tight and is not easy to open and keep flat (hence the loss of one star.)Other than that, this is a fairly standard binder - with traditional, easy to open rings with a mechanism that uses a lever on each end of the spine. I have taken this with me to school in a backpack with other material (including another binder), and it has held up well.The added ""green"" credentials with using recycled material add to its attractiveness.Overall, I like this binder.~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIB29JAEW4GB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HY9IOO#wasThisHelpful","RIB29JAEW4GB4","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stylus oozes good looks - right from its unique packaging, its wood finish, its distinctive shape, to its sleek minimalistic aesthetics. Unfortunately, this beauty is only skin deep - charging it involves some level of dis-assembly, and a worry about where to place the remaining parts of the stylus while it is charging.By default, the Pencil works as a spongy-tipped capacitive stylus - in any app, across all tablets, and even without being charged (since it does not use its Bluetooth radio.) Unfortunately, it is too expensive to be used in that mode.However, its true power (no pun intended) comes from its implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (v4.0) which allow its more advanced features to be brought online. However, this does mean that it requires iPad versions that support this specification, namely the iPad 3 and later.When powered up, the Pencil/53 can actively detect when it is pressed (using buttons at both ends) and communicate that to the the iPad. This lets you use the Pencil/53 as naturally as you might use a real pencil (write with one end, and erase using the other.)The iPad-only Paper/53 app (2012 app of the year) is designed to engage the complete feature set of the Pencil/53 - it knows the difference between the writing tip and the eraser end (erase), your finger (blend mode), and your palm (palm rejection). The app also allows easy Bluetooth connection, without going in to the iPad settings menu (by touching and holding a connection icon in the tool palette.)Personally, I found that I quite enjoyed using this stylus - connection was quick, there was no lag, and its ratio of charge to use time was very decent. I also liked its ability to stick securely to my iPad. It took me a while to get comfortable with the carpenter's pencil-styling, but I got there eventually.The nib is very soft, and moves smoothly across my screen. This is a good thing because I had to remove my screen protector to get this to work, and it would have been tragic to have my screen scratched by this stylus. However, this extra softness means that you need to bear down on the stylus a bit, so the tip can wear itself out very quickly. I used mine for about two weeks before I noticed it wearing out. Fortunately, it comes with a replacement, but I'm now even more conscious about wear and tear on the nib.The design of Paper/Pencil comes from a team with a great track record (Xbox/Kinect) and has venture funding from Horowitz/Andreesen (Interestingly, I just completed reading Ben Horowitz's book ""The Hard Thing about Hard Things"".)~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0DYNERU7U66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP12170#wasThisHelpful","R3L0DYNERU7U66","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each spring, the unfortunate combination of hungry mice and children who leave doors open, means that we are subjected to what seems like an invasion of rodents, leaving me scurrying for traps and peanut butter.Our last successful catch was a sticky strip that unfortunately left me having to deal with a scared, stuck mouse. After having had to physically put it out of its misery, I decided to explore additional options. (I am not particularly sentimental about mice, but it's still not something that I look forward to doing.)This one-time use, spin-based trap seemed like a great idea.I loved the ease of its setup (fill with bait, pull to prime, and place), and I liked the construction of this unit (easy to unset and reset).Unfortunately, in the weeks since I placed this trap, it has sat silent and lonely.It's hard to rate a mouse trap without a trapped mouse as proof. For now, I rated it at 3-stars (Its Okay) to reflect its ease of use, and to avoid skewing its product score.

"I am not a binder connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination - and my only strong emotion comes along when one falls apart earlier than I think it should.That said, I have carried this back and forth from school, in a backpack along with another binder, notebooks, and a laptop, and it has proved to be sturdy enough to survive without any visible ill-effects.This binder hosts some very nice features - plastic sleeves that are handy at holding on to extra stuff (such as index cards), outside pockets to label its contents, strong hinges, and the new one finger release (a huge ergonomic improvement).I have become very fond of that last feature ever since I encountered it on a previous binder. While I cannot remember ever having pinched my fingers within the traditional mechanism, it is still gratifying to see that inventors are still hard at work on old staples.I'll update this review if the tough hinges prove not to be as tough as they are purported to be, but for now I have no reason to suggest that the hinge material used is lacking in any way.Recommended!~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S79L9UHR01GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX5Z9C6#wasThisHelpful","R1S79L9UHR01GW","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:41 MinsThe HDR-PJ810 is a very competent video camera.Its robust specifications include 32GB internal memory, great image quality, 5.1 channel sound, extraordinary optical image stabilization, built-in projector, decent G-quality lens (12x optical zoom, fast F/1.8 lens, and 26.8mm at its widest), and wireless capabilities. Add to it the trademark super convenience of a built-in USB cable, compact form factor, and a built in projector light. This year's model also has a button that suppresses the camera user's voice.In addition, the camera is a pure joy to use. The touchscreen is generously sized, is responsive and very usable (e.g., for pulling focus.) All its hard buttons are very logically and intuitively placed. And, its weight is just right for extended periods of handheld video recording.The accompanying battery (NP-FV50) also was sufficiently capable - together with a spare I am able to cover an entire vacation day's worth of shooting.The only downsides to this camera come in comparison to its predecessor - the HDR-PJ790V, with its mind blowing capabilities (cavernous 96GB internal memory, brilliantly accurate Carl Zeiss lens, awesome microphone array, crazy good image stabilization, and built in GPS.) Of course, the HDRPJ810 is about 30% less expensive - so it is not hard to see why something had to give.Performance:#########That said - this camcorder is no slouch. As an example, see my uploaded video which was shot handheld at full zoom. This video was shot through a glass patio door - which did not throw off the camera's ability to focus on the subject. The capture quality was at the highest that the camcorder supports - [PS] @ 28 Mbps, 1920x1080 resolution, 60 frames per second, progressive. (For more details on image quality - see the ""Recording modes"" section below.)In particular, note that at the 11 sec point, I pulled focus using the touchscreen, and the image stabilization makes any camera shake barely noticeable.The projector image (30 sec point) shows a 48"" diagonal on a white screen. Going bigger tends to have a less satisfying image.You may also notice the high level of ambient microphone noise. This is probably due to the fact that the PJ810's microphone array is built into its body, placing it very close to the camera's electronics. This noise is less noticeable when there is action going on - as is typical with automatic gain control circuitry. (Here, I was trying to stay as quiet as possible.)In conclusion, this is an awesome video camera, and should be more than sufficient for normal home video usage. At its price point, this is an excellent balance of cost and functionality.Must have accessories:###############1] If you need additional battery power, check out the NP-FV70 or NP-FV100 instead.2] BC-TRV charger - I hate to leave camcorder charging overnight so this travel charger is very handy.3] VMCUAM2 USB adapter cable - lets you back up your videos to an external hard drive without needing a computer.Recording modes:############Sony uses video quality abbreviations - PS, FX, FH, HQ, and LP - that I'm clarifying for others who may be as confused as I was:There are 4 aspects to recording video - bit rate (the number of bits captured per second, in Mbps), the number of pixels in each video frame (full HD 1920x1080, or 1440x1080), frame rate (the number of frames recorded per second), and whether these frames are interlaced or progressive (whether each frame is captured in full, or whether the odd rows and even rows are captured separately.)For highest quality capture: pick the highest bit rate, the highest number of pixels in each frame, the highest frame rate, and use progressive mode.For the HDR-PJ810 this is [PS] quality - up to 28 Mbps, 1920x1080 resolution, 60 frames per second, progressive.The downside? All those bits take up a lot of disk space, reducing available recording time. Switching to FX or below, causes more aggressive compression - that can cause compression artifacts in fast moving scenes.My advice: stay at PS. Why compromise on quality? Just pack a external drive, and clean up space as you go.On the PJ810, to pick [PS] quality, use Menu > Image Quality/Size > Frame Rate > 60p. You will be warned that you cannot record this capture to DVD, and that you cannot take still photos while capturing video. (This is not a huge problem, as you can always do this in post production.)Happy Memories!~A_E~","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M9320XRI32P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNJWV1W#wasThisHelpful","R2M9320XRI32P1","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a value product that far outstrips its modest pricing. And, as long as you have modest expectations, this home theater setup is surprisingly competent. It is a very capable Bluray player, with a very well designed remote, and a decent set of speakers. Its weak spots are its receiver (which is extremely limited), and its lack of future expansion - neither of which are unexpected, given that a mid-grade receiver alone can cost more than this entire product.Setup was fairly straightforward - connect the speakers to the receiver (simply slot in the speaker wires), connect the HDMI out port to a TV, and run through simple setup steps for language selection, wired network setup, and verification of correct speaker cabling. That last one is particularly useful because it lets you get immediate confirmation of any cabling issues.The only additional setup that is necessary is to set up speaker levels - to adjust the output levels from each of the 5 speakers and the subwoofer.Once the unit was ready, I threw in a movie and was blown away by the picture quality - as good as what I get from my more expensive Bluray players. Sound quality was pretty decent, though on the bright side with strong highs but missing the mid and low frequencies. The subwoofer tended to pump out a lot of bass, but is best muted a bit as it ends up muddying the sound.In conclusion - this is a highly competent setup especially at this price point.While it will not anchor a home theater setup (a particular annoyance is its lack of wireless networking), it will serve very well as a secondary setup - for a dorm room or cabin.~A_E~","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33Q25QW1ITRJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IAELTLM#wasThisHelpful","R33Q25QW1ITRJL","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box contained the DAP-1520, a bunch of stickers with wireless access passwords, and an anemic instruction booklet. Unfortunately, that lulled me into a false sense of security and so I was floored by how confusing the setup process turned out to be.The steps (in an ideal world) are as follows:1. Plug in the DAP-1520 into a power outlet, and wait for the lights to go from solid red to blinking amber.2. Select the wireless network created by the DAP-1520, and enter the supplied wireless passphrase.3. Click the notification message displayed by the wireless icon in the status tray.4. In the browser window that opens up, provide the default password and choose to setup the unit.5. Provide the DAP-1520 with the login passphrase for your wireless access point6. Wait for the DAP-1520 to reboot - and you're done!Unfortunately, the user manual/sheet led me astray and I spent 20 minutes trying to figure this out. The worst was that the HTTP URL used to connect to the DAP-1520 that is provided on the manual did not match the URL printed on the sticker accompanying the unit. Later when I connected to it, I received a spinning Scanning logo that did not do anything.All in all, a very confusing experience was had by me. I love networking products (I'm a sucker for punishment) - so I managed to persevere through it all.Fortunately, since it was setup it has worked like a charm - for a range extender.In my experience, the best way to improve your network range is to (a) buy a more powerful router, or (b) setup a second access point as a repeater. If neither option is palatable, consider setting up a Moca network (uses coax cabling), or a Powerline network (uses electrical wiring.) I would recommend considering a range extender only after exhausting those other options.The good thing about this particular unit is that it is dual band - so you don't have to lose half your networking bandwidth as with older technologies (it can use one band to talk to you, and the other band to talk to the router.) This last part has to do with the fact that wireless networks are half-duplex - i.e., there can only be one transmitting unit on a network at any given time.Good luck with your purchase decision, and Happy Networking!~A_E~","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KEL14XR8CSDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I48MK9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1KEL14XR8CSDM","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TL;DR version:#######This is an almost-great product - a one-stop shop for a number of useful utilities that is unfortunately hobbled by an excessive pricing model, a troublesome licensing model, a sad set of functionality trade-offs, and surprisingly poor documentation.Unfortunately, given that there are such awesome free tools out there, I cannot recommend this tool set.Full review:#######This AirCheck product combines multiple networking tools into a single convenient Windows 8 style interface. In includes:1. A User Experience tool that lets you run basic tests that verify Access Point connection, DNS lookup, ping, traceroute, HTTP/FTP downloads, video/audio streaming, and simple HTTP browsing (which even tells your average download speed).2. A Survey tool that takes a custom architectural blueprint, and then lets you walk around your office space sampling throughput or signal strength. This is simply magical - and one of the must-have utilities in this tool set. I love this!3. A Device Finder that lists access points (and clients if you use the supplied adapter). A simple signal strength meter allows you to actively locate an access point.4. A Discovery feature that lists networks and lets you group them by access points or channels used.All of this is rolled into an organizational structure that is based on projects and tasks within that project.In my estimation, the Survey tool is the only must-have tool - where I do not know of a free equivalent.So what does not work well?####################1. Excessive pricing - Given that many of these tools are available for free (barring the Survey tool), I cannot see where the value proposition lies.2. Troublesome licensing model - you are tied to a single adapter (either within a laptop, or the supplied USB adapter). Any changes to the assigned adapter seems to need a valid support contract. This seems excessively restrictive.3. Sad set of functionality tradeoffs - unfortunately neither option (laptop adapter or supplied adapter) lets you access this tool's full functionality. Only the laptop adapter gives you access to the Survey tool (yeah!), whereas only the supplied adapter gives you access to the Client finder. I chose to sacrifice the Client finder, but this is a terrible choice to have to make with a product that costs this much.4. Surprisingly poor documentation - that should never have made it into a production-quality software product. For instance, it took me over an hour to figure out how to effectively use the Survey tool for a custom building plan- the documentation was completely lacking.Conclusion#######Overall, my recommendation would be to hold off until Fluke Networks has fixed some of these issues. Until then, there is a slew of free products (jPerf, inSSIDer, Wifi Analyzer, and Fing Network Tools) that should meet most needs.Happy Networking!~A_E~","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCW5UJJRLVLOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INMME42#wasThisHelpful","RCW5UJJRLVLOR","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The fabric feels noticeably coarse to the touch, and in general usage falls at about the average level.I'm assuming the 700 gallons of fresh water saved by these towels, comes from what it would take to grow the recycled cotton that makes up a third of these towels - which definitely sounds like a worthwhile goal.If I were rating these towels purely on personal preference, I would have given it 3 stars - It's Okay - as they are adequate at what they do.

"TL;DR version:This is a pretty neat keyboard: easy to setup, a very polished look and very comfortable to use. The only minor downside is that on the iPad 2, the volume and power buttons are not easy to get to (though the packaging claims that you will never need to use these buttons, which is actually correct.)Full version:Setup was a breeze - simply slot the iPad into the case (it fits very easily and very well), turn on the iPad's Bluetooth and pair with the keyboard. That's it!The keyboard was very easy to type with - the travel of each key was deep enough and soft enough that I could type this entire review on it without any issues. In addition, Fn keys exist to set volume and for common actions such as cut/copy/paste, etc. Finally, the Alt key along with the cursor keys support selecting of words; and the Command key lets you jet to the start/end of a line or page.The icing on the cake is the very decent aesthetics and ergonomics. This looks and feels like a high end product and there are lots of little touches that make it very comfortable to use  (such as soft bumpers on the edges and a finger hold to open the case.) Even the Belkin logo is tastefully discreet.The only problems I encountered with usability were the tiny Delete/Backspace key that was hard to hit consistently, and the Fn key at the far left that I kept hitting when I meant to hit the Alt key instead.While the volume buttons were not exposed easily on the iPad2, I did not feel their loss once I got used to the equivalent Fn keys on the keyboard. Likewise, while the power button is hard to access, the smart cover is very responsive and is a good alternative.Other than these minor gripes, this keyboard functions well, and is a joy to use.Happy Typing!A_E","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0K8UBEVMNUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELOEIDG#wasThisHelpful","R3F0K8UBEVMNUO","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Typical of NatGeo's Traveler series, you will find gorgeous photographs and great writing. My favorite sections were the awesome retelling of 5000 years of India's history, and a comparative review of her religions.Unfortunately, for me, it had the exact same problems as the others in this series: a font that I found frustratingly hard to read, maps that were barely usable which required a lot of hunting to find the points of interest mentioned in the text, and tepid itineraries (ref: Charting your Trip pp8-11).A bigger problem with this particular book is that it tries to cover too much in too few pages. For instance, the section on Delhi and its surroundings gets the star treatment, and is very well detailed, but this comes at the unfortunate expense of other areas. This is unavoidable with a country of this size and with such a rich cultural heritage - but it could have been mitigated with a tighter focus on sights represented from the remainder of the country.Overall, get this book if you are focused on the Golden Triangle (Delhi, Agra, Jaipur), or if you wish to spend time in Tamil Nadu. For all other areas, supplementary sources would undoubtedly be required.Happy Travels!~A_E~","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7I3X6S0W11H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142621183X#wasThisHelpful","R1A7I3X6S0W11H","A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FEGTOLCWXSV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy traveling, and often prepare for years before actually visiting a country.

Brazil has been on my wish list for a while now, and I found this book to be quite decent for the purpose of planning a trip there.The Discover series from Lonely Planet is my gold standard for such research, and I have previously been disappointed by NatGeo's travel books. As a result, I went in with lowered expectations.Unfortunately, while this book is very well written and has the trademark stunning photographs, I was less than impressed.This series in general uses a font that is very hard on my eyes which is a problem when it comes to extended reading. In addition, the maps are very frustrating as it is often very hard to locate an area being discussed in the text on the accompanying map. In addition, the ""insider tips"" were mostly uninteresting; and the suggested itineraries were greatly lacking.That said, I did enjoy the read, and in particular found the treatment of Bonita (ecotourism) and Manaus (gateway to the Amazon) done very well.I also liked NatGeo's approach of placing hotel/restaurant information at the end of the book - these get out-of-date very quickly, and I usually rely on review web sites for that information anyway. Keeping these lists at the end makes it easier to get at key travel information without having to wade through this in the middle of the book.In comparison, I found Fodor's Brazil 2014 to be a much better alternative as a pure travel planning guide.

"I have previously used much stronger formulations including the nuclear strength versions of Nizoral and Head+Shoulders. Both of these have been excellent at controlling my dandruff once it had been aggravated enough from lack of attention. When I got a chance to try out the CLEAR versions (Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh), I decided to take a chance on a brand that I had not tried before.It is useful to note that the CLEAR brand has a decent pedigree (it's from Unilever) - since I try not to experiment with chemicals from companies that I do not trust.Unfortunately, my experiences were mixed.Both products arrived in decent packaging, and arrived safely with a little piece of cellophane tape to prevent spills.

"I enjoyed the film. Yes there were flaws, such as the need to know about the earlier films and the villains in them to understand what was going on, and the unlikelihood that the current villain is who he claims to be, and such minor points as the female character looking like a vampire when she was given blood red lipstick to wear. But, overall, I found the film to be what I wanted it to be. There was lots of action, and I like films with action. Bond was his usual cool self, and I liked that.

"I disliked this film. The story could have been good, but I couldn't watch how it was acted after 52 minutes and shut it off, never seeing the end. The acting seemed so amateurish. The timing of the fight scenes was so off that it was clear that when one man supposedly hit another, he did not do so. The shooting scenes did not seem real; it was as if people were playing at it.

"In this interesting book, Deborah Gatchel explores biblical events by (1) adding details unstated in the Bible that explain what the Bible teaches and (2) by introducing people not mentioned in the Bible so that readers can see a deeper meaning in the biblical tales through their eyes, and she succeeds. She describes her goal: A common thread weaves through our stories  the power of faith in God. She quotes Romans 6:23 and states that people need to have faith in Jesus and earn eternal life.Each of Gatchels fifteen stories is written in a straight-forward, simple, and warm style. In the story of Noah and the flood, for example, she tells us about the reactions of members of Noahs family who would not accompany him and be saved on the ark, as well as how other people reacted during the decades in which he built the ark. In the tale about Abrahams servant obeying Abrahams request that he secure a wife for Abrahams son Isaac, Gatchel reveals the reactions of the young Rebekah and her familys thinking about the servants entreaty that they allow Rebekah to accompany him to become Isaacs wife. In the story about Moses, she tells us about his sister Miriam faithfully guarding her brother and introduces us to a brother not mentioned in the Bible. In the account about Paul, we are told how a slave who stole items from his master was influenced to change by Paul.All in all, Christians will enjoy these stories, obtain a keener insight into them, and be inspired.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PGFG5JL4GU2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099639950X#wasThisHelpful","R2PGFG5JL4GU2E","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being familiar with the Bible and knowing that the film would differ with the biblical story in a radical manner, I decided not to watch the film; but then I did. I enjoyed it and found it thought-provoking.I was right that the film has many events in it that are not in the Bible, and some are even contrary to what the Bible states. Among the many: The Bible does not state that the Israelites slaves built Egyptian palaces and enhanced the countrys glory. Moses was not an Egyptian general who led Egyptian forces against Hyksos, a better general than the future Pharaoh (son of the present Pharaoh), and saved his life during the battle. The Egyptians did not call out praises to Moses when he returned from the battle and ignored the future Pharaoh. Moses had two sons, not just one. The number of Israelite slaves in the Torah was 600,000 males, not 400,000.  Nun was not mentioned in the Bible as the man who told Moses he was an Israelite. God did not appear several times to Moses looking like a boy. There is no indication in the Torah that the plague of blood in the Egyptian waters was the result of crocodiles attacking Egyptian ships and chewing the Egyptian sailors. The Torah does not state that the plagues were designed to destroy the Egyptians economy, especially its food supply, and cause the population to call on Pharaoh to release the slaves. Moses did not train and lead a force of fighters to fight Pharaohs army. Pharaoh did not order his people to seek out and kill Moses. The Egyptian population did not shout curses at the Israelites as they left Egypt, the Bible states the opposite; they even gave gifts to the departing nation.I found the film version inspirational, as I will state more fully in a moment, I thought that Christian Bale was a better Moses than Charleston Hesston in the earlier film version. He was more human. I liked many comments in the film; for example, when Moses told the Israelites to put lamb blood on their door posts and the Israelites asked him, will it help, Moses responded: If I am right, we will bless the lambs for eternity.What I am about to say will bother some readers but it is worth thinking about. While the film version of the exodus is different than the Torah version, it may be true or at least a fair explanation of the biblical tale. The Torah itself frequently gives more than one version of a story. For example, there are two versions of the Ten Commandments, one in Exodus 20 and one in Deuteronomy 5. One version saying the son who tried to save Joseph from being killed by his brothers was Reuben, the other Judah. One says Joseph was sold to Ishmaelites, the other to Midianites. There are two different accounts (minor differences) between what occurred when Abraham sent his servant to acquire a wife for his son Isaac between the narrative and how the servant described it. There are more than a few times that the Bible tells a story which is followed by a song (such as the tale of the drowning of Egyptians at the Red Sea and Joshuas victory at Jericho), and in each instance the details in the song differ with the narrative account (for example, it is only in the song that the sun stood still). Is it possible that the story of the flood is a version of the Gilgamesh tale which was composed before the time of Moses?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYXSRUZVZEVIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPQ6KQ#wasThisHelpful","RYXSRUZVZEVIX","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bob Steele (1907-1988) began to star in B westerns in 1927. In the 1940s, his career as a star cowboy began to fade and he accepted supporting roles for several decades. In this 1945 film, he stars as the adopted son of an Indian Agent who is killed during a robbery. He goes out to find the killer of his adopted father and to find his real father. He is able to identify his adopted father's killer by a ring and watch that the killer took from him. He can identify his natural father by means of another watch that his now dead mother had.

"While the film is fiction, it portrays and indicts the barbaric system of divorces in Israel that are no better than how women were treated in the Middle Ages. In Israel, only rabbinical courts can issue divorces, but as shown in this film, the rabbis believe they can only issue a divorce if the husband agrees to give the divorce to his wife. A woman cannot initiate a divorce. As a result, husbands can refuse to grant wives divorces leaving them unable to marry. They are chained to their husband for life even though the husband is not living with them, supporting them, and able, under Jewish law, to marry another woman. This situation needs to be changed.In this film, we see the common occurrence. The wife Viviane Amsalem wants a divorce from her husband who is extremely controlling. There is no doubt that the marriage cannot endure, but the rabbis continually insist that Viviane return to her husband and try to work out the marriage. This goes on for about a dozen appearances before the rabbinical court of three rabbis, for over five years during which time Viviane suffers. Viewers will see how unsympathetic the rabbis are to her situation, how little they know of psychology, and how prejudiced the rabbis are in favoring the male.The film was made in Israel and the people speak in Hebrew, but there are subtitles which are easy to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZZKQ94TH1LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNEJ2LQ#wasThisHelpful","RIZZKQ94TH1LD","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent haunting novel by an author who died at age 36, the year that this book was published, in 1962. He wrote one book before this one The Human Season, and two were published posthumously, The Tenants of Moonbloom and The Children of the Gate. All four received positive well-deserved acclaim. Dara Horn wrote the informative Forward to this volume. The Pawnbroker is considered the best and most powerful book dealing with the trauma produced by the holocaust. The book was a National Book Award finalist. It sold 500,000 copies when it was published. It was made into a powerful film starring Rod Steiger in 1964, and Steiger won a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance of Sol Nazerman.Nazerman survived the World War II Nazi death camp where he lost his parents, wife, and children. The experience left him bereft of hope and deprived him of feelings for people. He is 45 years old. He lost his family fifteen years ago. He opened a pawn shop in Harlem where he deals with prostitutes, pimps, and thieves, which Wallant describes with skill and feelings. Wallant also describes other characters involved in Nazermans life with similar skill. There is his sister, her husband, and their child, an aged woman with a dying father with whom Nazerman secures sexual release. Nazerman supports all four of them. There is also a young black man who is Nazermans assistant in the shop with whom he has an ambivalent relationship. His pawnshop makes no money and Nazerman survives only because the shop is a front for gangsters who pay him a salary, a situation that bothers him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EBO45UDTW22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493149#wasThisHelpful","R30EBO45UDTW22","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jews and non-Jews have recognized the practical wisdom of many of the sayings in Pirkei Avot, The Ethics of the Fathers, and many Jews can quote its teachings from memory. Jews considered the Ethics of the Fathers so significant that many excellent commentaries have been written on the Ethics and the custom arose to read one chapter a week during the summer months.But this Koren volume is unique in half a dozen ways that make it special. The Hebrew script and English translation are broken down, as is usual in Koren books, into easy to read phrases with excellent print. The translation of the six chapters by Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks is in modern English, with Rabbi Sacks sometimes paraphrasing the Hebrew text when it makes more sense to do so rather than presenting an awkward literal English translation. Rabbi Marc D. Angel has given a very learned introduction in which he points out, among much else, that Great sages in ancient civilizations have provided teachings to help guide humanity to harmonious, happy, and wise lives. Among the wisest and most influential teachers were those of ancient Israel.Rabbi Angel offers explanation of all of the wise ancient sayings, presenting both traditional commentaries as well as learned thoughts by others, Jews and non-Jews, which add depth to the teachings of the fathers. He supplements the wise lessons of the ancients with modern information such as the following. An Israeli Nobel Prize winner described the illusion of validity: people tend to think their judgments are valid even when based simply on first impressions or relatively short observations and are often badly mistaken. A psychiatrist wrote that We establish irrational ideals of the real man and the right kind of woman, which not only separates us more and more from our genuine potentialities, but in the long run also lead us into self-destructiveness. The philosopher of the late first and early second century CE, Epictetus, warned Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake but for the sake of having done right. An American scientist observed: One human trait, urging us by our nature, is the drive to be useful.Rabbi Angel adds historical information. He describes, for instance, the period of the Great Assembly (a congress of some seventy elders), followed by the Zuggot (leadership by the pairs), followed by the governance by descendants of the family of Hillel, and gives biographical data about each man mentioned in the book. He notes that the Ethics represents different generations and historical conditions in the Land of Israel, and he explains the differences. He describes five periods. He tells how there are sayings of nineteen sages who lived prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE; sixteen who flourished from 70 through the early second century when Israel was under the harsh dominion of Rome; fourteen between the early second century through the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Rome in 132-135; eleven sages following the rebellion through the late second century; and eight scholars who lived between the late second century through the early third century; sixty eight wise men in all.The book is filled with a wealth of other information, inspiring stories, and the results of psychological experiments. For example: the psychologist Erich Fromm noted that most people fail in life because they are unable to make a decision when they come to metaphorical forks in the road; people are so impressed by being watched that when a picture of two eyes is painted on an honor box to pay for beverages, people paid more than twice as much for their drinks; nations perish when its people forget where they came from.In short, while other commentaries on Pirkei Avot have much to offer, this volume will teach readers very much in an interesting, thought-provoking, and enjoyable manner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y977XR1CDGB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9653017500#wasThisHelpful","R1Y977XR1CDGB8","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new translation and commentary on the biblical book of Psalms is very good for four reasons: (1) The Hebrew script and English translation are broken down, as is usual in Koren books, into easy to read phrases. (2) The translation of the Psalms by Rabbi Eli Cashdan is in modern English. For example, Psalm 23 begins:A psalm of David.The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.He makes me lie down in green pastures;He leads me beside still watersInstead of:He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;He leadeth me beside the still waters.(3) The book contains a learned and easy to read introduction and commentary by Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb who is not only a renowned rabbi but a former practicing psychologist and able to understand the emotions underlying many of the psalms. (4) The book is filled with a wealth of information and inspiration. For example: (a) Each of the 150 psalms is preceded by a brief meditation written in the first person which captures the predominant mood of the psalm. The introduction for the first psalm, for instance, has; I face a difficult choice. Good versus evil. How can I choose? Will I regret my choice of the former, when the latter has such obvious advantages? (b) Each psalm is followed by an essay that expounds upon one or two of its central teachings. (c) It contains prayers to be recited before and after the reading of psalms. (d) It identifies nine psalms that can be recited on special occasions such as prayers for recovery from illness and prayers to be recited at a cemetery. (e) It also has two charts that people can use to study the psalm weekly or monthly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TR678XXCO3QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9653012061#wasThisHelpful","R3TR678XXCO3QM","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film has two features that raise it slightly above the usual western: race and the mistreatment of wives. It is 1861 and the civil war has just begun. Army forces in Texas leave to fight in the east leaving no soldiers to aid the settlers against the Indians. A white man and a black man grew up together and try to organize the settlers to fight the Indians, but some settlers do not want to be with the black man. Additionally, while one man's wife wants her husband to act reasonably, he hits her. The Indians attack and kidnap all the settles' wives and children.

However it has problems: much of the book is out of date, it having been published in 1904; the language is sometimes obscure since it is based on Scottish, and the kindle version, as noted by other reviewers is not very good. However, the rhymes, games, songs, stories for bairns and big folk has much to delight. It also has interesting information, such as the poems Little Jack Horner and Mary had a Little Lamb are based on true stories.

"After reading half a dozen pages, Steve N. Lees action drama grabbed me. I was interested in finding out what happened. Soon I was also wondering about Tess Williams past.A beautiful young woman is seeking work, any kind of work, so that she and her mother who is dying can leave this Baltic country and travel to England where her mother, who is extremely ill, perhaps even dying, may get medical help. But her purse was stolen. She has no money. She is willing to clean houses to get money, to get out. A handsome personable man offers her a job and drives her to it. But there is no job. Instead she is beaten and raped.The girls mother is looking for her. She sees a five foot seven beautiful woman save a couple by beating up three men who threatened them. This is Tess who has a past where harm was done to her in America. She spent ten years training in hand to hand combat and breathing exercises to control herself, who is determined to take revenge for what was done to her. Until then she helps others who need help, just as she helped the couple that the mother saw. She had killed 56 people. She wears a bullet-proof vest when need as well as other protective gear, including glove with metal inside. The abducted girls mother feels certain that Tess can help her. Tess feels sorry for her and agrees to help find her daughter.The book tells of their search and the difficulties they encounter and the people Tess must fight and those she must kill. It is, as I wrote, gripping. It is also suspenseful. The figure of Tess is nicely drawn and we identify with her. There is much suspense and a lot of action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F82BHIAN6J4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PC623G#wasThisHelpful","R2F82BHIAN6J4L","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an important work, with this volume being only the beginning of the half dozen books in the series. Ginzberg points out that the tales that he collected were not invented in the synagogue, but by the people who wanted to see the biblical stories in a miraculous manner. The stories show Gods involvement in human affair and magnifies the heroic efforts of biblical characters. Maimonides (1138-1204) pointed out in his work called Chelek that anyone who accepts Midrashim, legends, as being true is a fool. So too anyone who dismisses them because they are untrue is also a fool, because the rabbis used these legends in a homiletical manner to teach lessons. They used the popular tales as parables, changing them slightly to make their point.Whether one is interested in the legends to see what the ancients thought or to try to mine them for the rabbinical lesson, the legends are fascinating, just as fiction is fascinating when it is told well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33V1VD3V0XBHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC24ES#wasThisHelpful","R33V1VD3V0XBHB","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pictures in the book are delightful. The first story is called Fair. In it, grandma takes the kids to a fair because when she was a child, she went every year. Two hundred times, one of the kids laughed. The children needed to bring a gift to enter the fair. Ben brought a book, Zach a plastic sword, and Chelsea an old rattle. The kids saw many things and participated in them. There were rides, prizes, cotton candy, corn on the cob, cakes, fresh milk, animals in a petting zoo, and they saw piglets in a mock fight, and more. Kids reading what they saw and did will enjoy their adventures vicariously.The second tale Crepes describes how the three kids helped mom make crepes. It was a fun adventure making the crepes and setting the table. The kids promised to be good if mom makes crepes once a week.The third story Park tells the adventures of the children when they went to a picnic in the park with mom and dad.

I could click on whatever work I wanted to read and the book, short story, or other writing would appear instantaneously. I also found that it is very easy to read and not as some other versions of older writings that were placed by others on kindle, which are filled with mistakes. This huge kindle Thackeray version contains the complete novels, novellas, short stories, satires, drama, poems, travel, nonfiction, and letters.William Makepeace Thackeray (1811 1863) was an English novelist of the nineteenth century. He is famous today for his satirical works, especially Vanity Fair, which is a panoramic portrait of English society of his day. In this masterpiece, which has become a part of university courses, and has been repeatedly adapted for the cinema and television, Thackeray shows a fondness for roguish upstart Becky Sharp while he satirizes high society, military prowess, the institution of marriage, and hypocrisy.In his own time, during the Victorian era, he was ranked second only to Charles Dickens; Anthony Trollope ranked his History of Henry Esmond as his greatest work; Charlotte Bronte considered him her favorite author. But while many enjoy all or most of his writings, he is known today almost exclusively for Vanity Fair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H91M0QJZ9Q5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P7F0LG#wasThisHelpful","R3H91M0QJZ9Q5Y","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is disturbing, humorous, serious, critical, thought-provoking, and a necessary read for people who want to understand international affairs, the situation in Israel, and how outsiders can influence events with terrible results. It was a number 1 best seller in Israel. The book is well written and gonzo journalism at its best.Gonzo journalism is a writing that does not claim to be objective. It frequently includes the author as a participant in the story. It is usually written in an energetic participatory writing style in which the author is the prime protagonist. It is generally made up of a combination of social critique and a satire of ones self, which can be biting and quite humorous. It focuses on personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which prefers a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. Yet its goal is to reveal the truth. Catch a Jew has all of these characteristics.Tuvia Tenenbom was born in Israel to a very religious family, but gave it all up, became a secular Jew and left Israel. He speaks English, Hebrew, Arabic, and German, and is able to use these skills together with his warm and often jolly personality during a period of seven months when he interviewed all kinds of people in Israel. He was able to convince the people to whom he spoke to open up to him because he was not a Jew, but a German  who the Palestinians like  or an Arab.Most of the Israeli Jews that he interviewed are self-haters, man and women, from the street or in top governmental offices, who criticize Israel. They are people on the left who support the Palestinian causes and those on the right who feel the Israeli government is not doing all it should be doing, such as settlers. All of the Palestinians who he interviewed hate Israel and say that they feel they are living in an occupied country, even those living in Israel and not in the west bank or Gaza. They cry that they are poor and mistreated although they obtain free health care, free college, and some live in luxurious homes.What is most disturbing is that outside agencies such as the Red Cross and governments, especially Germany, not only support the Palestinians with huge gifts of money, but they encourage Palestinians to have demonstrations and riots, and they incite them to lie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3JHXI1D5JYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9652297984#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3JHXI1D5JYG","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This play by the famed Greek playwright Euripides (480-406 BCE) is a supernatural tale of King Admetus who was told that he would not die if he could find another person who was willing to die for him. In his play, Euripides analyses the psychology of the king. After being rebuffed by his parents, he asks his wife to die for him. She agrees on the condition that he marries no other person after her death. She explained that she loves her two children and feared that a stepmother would not treat them well. The king agrees and she dies. Soon after her death, the king realizes two things. First, he acted dishonorably and second, he misses his wife. This is he who lives in shame because he dared not do. He never knew her worth he will know it now.Just as she is being buried, Heracles appears at the kings palace. Unasked by the king, he goes out, wrestles with death, defeats death, and brings back Alcestis to her husband alive.Interestingly, Alcestis is unable to speak when she reappears after her death. Her husband asks why this is so. Heracles explains that it is only after three days after death that one can be fully alive again. This brings to mind the story of the resurrection of Jesus after three days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWQK07ATHVZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374527261#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWQK07ATHVZV","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wine is an essential part of Judaism. It is mentioned 136 times in the Hebrew Bible, sometimes to emphasize its possible harmful effects on people, as with Noah, Laban, and King Ahasuerus; sometimes as part of the sacrifice that was offered to God, as in the book of Leviticus and elsewhere; and sometimes to praise it, as in Song of Songs and Proverbs. When the wine was poured as a sacrifice on the altar, the Levites in the Temple would break into song. Wine introduces the meal of the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, the Sabbath, when before the Sabbath meal is eaten, a meal more sumptuous than meals during the rest of the week, a blessing is said before eating that meal over wine because wine taste good and enhances the meal and it is therefore a suitable introduction to the meal. The drinking of the wine at this time came to be thought of as being on a human level similar to the wine offered to God with sacrifices,  and therefore, just as only the best kind of wine was offered as a sacrifice, so too many Jews felt that only the best kind of wine should be used for this blessing, which is called kiddush, meaning sanctification, and which teaches the possibility for holiness that can exist in the Sabbath if it is properly observed.Rabbis extolled wine in the Talmud. Bava Batra 12b states: one who routinely drinks wine  even if his heart is totally stopped up  the wine will make him intelligent.  Nedarim 10b states that a Nazarite who swears off drinking wine because he wants to rectify a personal failing or to rise to a higher spiritual level through abstinence must bring a sin offering because one should not abstain from legitimate pleasures. Wine is considered so special that while the blessing over bread at the beginning of a meal covers all foods during the meal  meaning, people do not have to make additional blessings for each type of food  this rule does not apply to wine; whether drunk alone, before the meal, or during the meal, one must say the blessing thanking God for the wine.Irving Langer relates the history of the Jewish consumption of wine and tells about the different kinds of wines and how they can be enjoyed. Historians estimate that there were hundreds of wine presses scattered throughout Israel during the Roman period (63 BCE  70 CE) and the ancient Jews of the second temple period (516 BCE  70 CE) consumed about three hundred gallons of wine each year and also produced huge amounts of wine for export. Wine making flourished in Israel and came to an end with the Islamic conquest of the country in the seventh century CE. Jews outside of Israel also produced wine, but in the Middle Ages, Jews were prohibited from owning land and this put an end to this activity.When Jews settled in America, the Jewish desire for wine prompted the making of wine in New York State from Concord grapes, but the result was coarse and bitter and had to be sweetened with lots of sugar to make it palatable. Not knowing that these Manischewitz and Shapiro sweetened wines were inferior wines that needed to be adulterated, several generations of Jews began to believe that kosher wine needed to be sweet, a belief that many still have today. Twenty-five years ago, more than ninety percent of kosher wines were sweet, today, over eighty percent of kosher wines are dry, and the best of the sweet kosher wines are produced at great expense to make the very best dessert wines.The production of dry kosher wines in America began in the late 1950s. Today there are over 1500 types of kosher wines,  produced throughout virtually every wine growing area in Europe, including five different areas in Israel where world-class quality wines are produced.  Israel began to produce wine again in 1848 in the Old City of Jerusalem. By 2010, Carmel Winery, the largest winemaker in Israel, won the Decanter International Trophy in the Red Rhone varietal group, beating nearly eleven thousand wines from forty-one countries. Barkan Winery is the second largest winery in Israel, producing about seven to nine million bottles of wine a year.There are many varieties of wine, but there are six big varieties, three whites and three reds: Riesling, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blank (all whites), and Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon (reds).  Irving Langer explains how professional wine critics taste in only a sip of wine earthy, bright, spicy, fruity, complex, about the various aroma qualities, taste qualities, aftertaste, color, and more. He also gives ten steps that one should take to secure the best enjoyment in drinking wine. He tells how there are two tastes that wine gives: the first when the wine is on your tongue and the second when you swallow. He explains that different wine glasses are used for different varieties, how to order wine in a restaurant, how to store wine, why wine is taken from the middle and not the top or bottom of the winery barrel, and much more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCQQVSDKXZME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9652295736#wasThisHelpful","R3PCQQVSDKXZME","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The copyright of the Burroughs Jack Carter books have expired and therefore these excellent books are available in various formats for a very low fee, or even free from some sources. Amazon offers a set of all Edgar Rice Burroughs seven Jack Carter books about his experiences on Mars for only ninety-nine cents. However, there are a total of eleven Jack Carter Mars books. Burroughs is famous for writing the Tarzan books, but he wrote many other kinds of books. The following is some highlights about this book, but I am careful not to include a host of details that make the book interesting, clever, and suspenseful.Jack Carter of Virginia was a captain in the Confederate Army. He had served previously in various countries as a soldier of fortune and was well-adapt in military affairs and was very strong. After the Civil War, he and a fellow officer went west prospecting for gold. They found a large vein of gold, but while attempting to lay claim to the strike, his partner was killed by Indians and Carter lay wounded in a cave. He awoke naked and discovered that somehow he had been transferred to Mars. In the first book of the seven book series, Carter in involved in many adventures. Because of the lesser gravity in Mars, Carter is able to leap very high and he is stronger than the many different kinds of Martians. At the end of the book, he saves Mars from extinction, but is transported back to earth. In this volume, after an absence of some ten years on earth, Jack Carter is transported again to Mars. But he finds himself in an area and among a people very different than those he knew during his prior visit. He is now in the land that is the subject of superstition. The rest of the people on Mars believe that when they are ready to die, they go to this land where god is. The belief is that no one can come back from this land. If, as happened once, a person does come back, and that person says that the land is not a peaceful and happy place, but a land where those who come to it are treated badly, are enslaved, and when its inhabitants tire of the person, they eat them  if a person came back and said this, the people would call that person a blasphemer and kill that person.Carter needs to escape this land and find his wife. He undergoes many adventures. Among them he must save himself from being killed as a blasphemer, he meets a young person who looks like him, he discovers that his wife has been taken hostage by the people in this heaven, he leads an army to rescue her, and he meets the god.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXUK4C84ZLP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1169293069#wasThisHelpful","R3MXUK4C84ZLP0","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This tale by the famed English satirist William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-1863), author of the highly respected Vanity Fair, is a childrens story filled with humor and sprinkled lavishly with nonsense. It is the story of a fairy, a king of two kingdoms, their offspring, and an old ugly woman. Virtually every name in the tale is funny, as is all the incidences. Children will not understand every satire, but will enjoy the tale. Adults will do both.The legitimate king and queen of both kingdoms were dethroned by people who should not have done so. The son of one kingdom is kept in the palace but receives no education and cannot even spell. The daughter of the other kingdom wandered away during the rebellion and was raised by lions. A fairy was invited to all royal births and gave magical gifts. She gave a magical ring to the mother of the uneducated boy before the rebellion, who passed it on to her son, and a feather to the son of the other kingdom after his father ceased the kingdom. Both items made the wearer appear to be the most handsome or beautiful person in the kingdom. The fairy became tired of giving magical gifts and so, at the birth of the later uneducated son and the birth of the daughter who was later raised by lions, she gave the wish that the suffer some adversities (and therein lies the moral of the tale). All of the fairies gifts, of course, came true, and therein lies the story.For example, different people secured the ring and feather at different times. Once, an ugly old lady picked up the ring and the uneducated son fell in love with her and promised to marry her, and signed a paper to that effect. But later, when she wasnt wearing the ring, he fell in love with the girl who was raised by the lions. What could he do?Beside the adventures resulting from the ring and the feather, there was the problem of how to rectify the illegal seizure of kingdoms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N3B378W2N5TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083Z1O2M#wasThisHelpful","R1N3B378W2N5TU","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of Wilkie Collins novels. I join with others in considering his Moonstone and Woman in White as masterpieces. I have enjoyed many of his novels. But I did not like this one very much; and it seems from the works of literary critics, I am not alone in feeling this way. The problem, I think, is that the book moves somewhat slowly in the first couple of hundred pages. However, the book develops into a criminal case based on a real life situation. This part is very interesting. The following is the general plot at the outset of the book.Blind Love is the last of Wilkie Collins books. Actually, he never finished it. He published the beginning parts in serial fashion in a magazine, as was customary in the nineteenth century, but on his death bed, he gave very detailed notes to his friend Walter Besant, including lots of dialogue he planned to insert in the book.  Besant finished the book, but does not reveal where his input began.Three men love Iris. Her rich strong-willed father loves her and wants to protect her, but he insists that she marry Hugh. He tells her that if she marries Lord Harry, she will receive no money from him. He will disinherit her. Hugh loves her dearly, but Iris rejected his proposal several times. Nevertheless, he does not give up and is determined to help her in any way that he can. Hugh is a very honest Englishman. In contrast, Irish Lord Harry was disinherited by his father because, while he is exceptionally charming, he is very impetuous and has been involved in many disreputable adventures. Among others, he gambled all of his money on a horse race and lost it all. He also loves Iris, but there is also another emotion that is driving him. He wants to avenge the murder of his friend; he wants to kill the murderer. It is he that Iris loves blindly. While she knows all of Harrys faults, she overlooks them.There are three other characters that impact upon the above-mentioned four people. Dr. and Mrs. Vimpany do various things that hurt Iris. Dr. Vimpany is a drunk who is interested in obtaining money and willing to do so in a criminal manner. He is the worst villain in this novel. Mrs. Vimpany is a former actress who uses her acting skills to fool people. Iris has a maid with a strange and secret past that has had a strong effect on her life. She is filled with hatred against men and is unpredictable. She is an excellent foil against Mr. Vimpany and is the hero of this story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25A6XBBJSVH0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084770IG#wasThisHelpful","R25A6XBBJSVH0Z","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enoch is not part of the Bible. In fact, much of what is in it does not match what is in the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament. It is filled with superstitious ideas. I Enoch was composed sometime around 200 BCE.  The third century was a period of enormous distress for Jews, and the masses, unable to help themselves, sought an explanation for the evil around them and prayed for supernatural aid. Enoch was not unique in differing from mainstream Judaism. The writings of the times did not generally reflect mainstream Jewish thinking and contained many borrowed terms from non-Jewish sources.I Enoch, for example, is the first book that interprets Genesis 6 as a description of fallen angels. It describes a group of angels who descend to earth because of a sexual lust for earthly women. They defile their pure heavenly essence by joining with the women and having children who are giants. They teach their wives and children knowledge that humans should not have, such as the ability to write and the process of performing abortions. Their children befoul the earth and lead to the flood in the days of Noah.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQ5VGFS1D30N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8562022454#wasThisHelpful","R3AQ5VGFS1D30N","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many individuals of all faiths use the famed biblical and talmudic French rabbi Rashi (1040-1105) to help them understand the Bible. Rashi is a master writer. His commentaries are short, to the point, clarifying, and interesting. People enjoyed his explanations so much that the first Hebrew book printed after the invention of the printing press around 1450 was Rashis Torah commentary in 1475. This book was printed before the printing of the Torah in Hebrew. But, as we will see, the love that most Jews had for Rashi was somewhat like an uneducated peasant who is in love with a princess. Users of Rashis interpretations lose much by not understanding what the authors goal is and how what he says implements his goal. In fact, unless a person understands Rashis methodology, he or she will get the wrong idea what the sage is saying and why he made his comment. There are many scholarly books that address this problem such as Sarah Kumins Rashis Exegetical Categorization: In Respect to the Distinction between Peshat and Derash, and Avraham Grossmans Rashi.Following his five volume Whats Bothering Rashi, composed in English, Rabbi Dr. Avigdor Bonchek has written a short 136 page book, Rashi: The Magic and the Mystery, that addresses what Rashi students need to know. He writes in very readable English, with many examples for everything he explains. He addresses Rashis history, his style, why his explanations are unique, his use of Midrash, what he means when he states he will only address the plain meaning of the text, why his grandson Rashbam disagreed with his methodology, how everyone should question what Rashi is saying, and much more.Bonchek points out that readers should not be fooled by the seemingly simple style of Rashis comments. Rashi was an extremely careful writer. Rashis primary goal was to address a problem he sees in the Torah text and he used a Midrash  in seventy percent of his commentaries  only when what the Midrash states fits in with what he considers the plain meaning of the text.Bonchek states that Rashi does many things. Among much else, Rashi explain difficult passages and seeming contradictions, he helps folks avoid misunderstandings, he sometimes does so by translating familiar words in ways that enhance their meaning, he selects one of the many Midrashim that he feels answers a difficulty that he sees in the text  although he does not reveal what difficulty he sees. When using a Midrash, he may select one that is commenting on another verse and may change the Midrashs wording and he may combine two separate Midrashim, if doing so helps him clarify a passage  for the goal of the Midrash is to teach a moral lesson, while Rashi uses the Midrash to explain a verse. Sometimes he even invents his own Midrash to meet his clarification goal. Sometimes Rashi has two comments one derash and the other peshat, usually because neither one by itself satisfied him in explaining the passage or word.Besides not recognizing what and why Rashi comments as he does, not knowing Rashis style could mislead users of his commentary. For example, Rashi starts every parasha (weekly Torah reading) with lead words containing the name of the parasha for no other reason than to indicate where the parasha begins.  Many do not know that he is doing so, and mistakenly seek a textual difficulty that Rashi is addressing. He also begins each of the five books of the Torah with a comment showing Gods love of Israel and their land. He apparently did so to inspire Jews and teach Torah values. Failure to recognize this, led many individuals to misread what Rashi is doing.In short, Rashi devotees miss what he is doing unless they understand that something is bothering Rashi and that Rashi does not reveal what this is, and fail to discover what that something is, and how Rashi resolves the problem he sees.This book is an excellent clear introduction to Rashis unique interpretative methodology. I had only two problems with it, one minor and one major. The minor one is that Rabbi Dr. Bonchek decided to use the current practice of calling most sages, except Rashi, using the word the, as in the Rashbam, the Ramban, etc. I found this annoying. The other issue is that he did not identify that Rashi is following the methodology of Rabbi Akiva.Two talmudic sages of the second century, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael, disagreed on how to interpret the Bible.  Rabbi Akiva, unfortunately in my opinion, won out, and Rashi and most ancient Bible commentators as well as most Midrashim follow his view.  He felt that since the Torah is divine, and since God makes no mistakes, and is able to make an idea clear without any repetition, whenever the Bible repeats itself, the seeming repetition must be understood as Scripture making a new statement, and one needs to ask what is the Torah saying with this seeming repetition? This explains many Rashi comments. Rashi is saying that the seeming repetition or seeming unnecessary extra word, a practice that occurs very frequently in the Torah, is revealing something new. Rashi quotes many Midrashim because they are reflecting the Akiva methodology.In contrast, Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Torah [that was given to humans in a manner that they can understand and therefore] speaks in human language. The frequent repetitions or extra words are used for emphasis and to enhance the beauty of what is said, sometimes giving the statement a near poetic nuance. Maimonides accepted Rabbi Ishmaels method of understanding the Torah, as did Rashis grandson Rashbam, and as do most modern Bible commentators.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9BX0CIOW6E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VBUPPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1W9BX0CIOW6E6","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Children are fascinated by animals. Most of them like to have pets and to visit zoos. This is good not only because it widens the childrens understanding of the world but it also teaches them that every species of animals is different, yet all are interesting, even animals that are dangerous. This teaches kids to extend their understanding of animals to humans. Just as all animals differ, so do all humans, yet everyone should be respected.D. J. Thomas book is a perfect aid to teach children about animals. It offers information about many species and does so in an interesting manner, one that will enchant kids. It describes each breed, tells what the animal eats, what it does during the day and night, how long the animal lives, and other fascinating bits about each animal. It is jam-packed with information. It speaks about elephants, anacondas, chimpanzees, parrots, flying foxes, geckos, gorillas, iguanas, jaguars, cobras, komodo dragons, leopards, and many more.For example, Thomas tells how elephants swim using their trunks and that crocodiles swallow stones to aid them in swimming deeper. Flying foxes have a wing-span of at least six feet in length and cobras eighteen feet long. Iguanas can be seven feet long and can last under water for thirty minutes. The book also defines terms that children should know such as mammals, nocturnal, carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores, and identifies animals that eat and sleep in these ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R790HPTYA35FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY2IYKU#wasThisHelpful","R790HPTYA35FD","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting Swedish mystery with Kurt Wallander leading a team of detectives attempting to solve two crimes. While the mood of the story is often gloomy  rain, personal worries, fear that his (Wallanders) girlfriend is seeing another man, illnesses, old age, deaths, needing to give up planned vacations, lack of sleep, Wallanders new boss being unsure of himself  this atmosphere does not detract from the story. It offers readers a more in-depth understanding of characters and the difficulties facing the police. It is true that when I watched the TV versions of several Wallander mysteries which were moody, I was somewhat turned off by the gloom, but I did not have this feeling reading this book or the several other Mankell Wallander mysteries that I read. In fact, I looked forward to reading this book and enjoyed it. It is well written and gripping. One of the mysteries, the smaller one, the one that takes up less police and story time, is the apparent suicide of a young Jamaican girl who showed up in Sweden for unknown reasons, seemed to be afraid of something, went out to a strange field, apparently simply because it was there, poured gasoline in a circle around her and on her, and when Wallander began to approach her, she ignited herself and burned to death. Wallander and his team try to find out why she apparently wanted to commit suicide and why she did it the way she did, for there is just about no more hurtful way to die than to be burned to death. This is why Joan of Arc was burned and why witched were burned, to give them as much pain as possible. The other mystery is what seem to be bizarre serial killings. We are told that the murderer identifies with Herbert Hoover of the American FBI and with the Indian Chief Geronimo, and that he paints his face when he goes out to kill. We are also told that he is seeking revenge for his sister. This is about all we know at the onset of the novel, but the police do not know this. What they do know is that the murders are carefully planned, an ax or hatchet is used, and the victims are scalped. They try to find a connection between the victims but do not find it and they try to delve into the psychology of the murderer but do not see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AKG6T19VF4WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MJDJQQ#wasThisHelpful","R2AKG6T19VF4WI","A2KWQ64TRHB3YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use a lot of Honeyville products (I'm sure I financed some of their equipment, along the way), and most all of their products are good to excellent, anyway. The butter is great - and really can only compare to their 'powdered shortening' for cooking convenience in a pinch.I've also used their powdered milk to cook with, and to substitute for butter when out, but you can tell the taste, and it is quite-wasteful of the powdered milk.With the powdered butter, just add water to consistency-desired, and either slap it on the toast, or blend it into the recipe. I find that the powdered shortening (just put a teaspoon of it in the skillet as a powder, and fire the skillet up - it melts in the pan) works better to keep food from sticking in a cast iron skillet, but if cooking with the butter, you can't beat the taste. Most, I'd say, couldn't tell it from fresh butter - and if you are making mac-n-cheese from powder, in the field, you need a bit of this and a bit of powdered milk, to mix up your cheese sauce.To keep it fresh, everyone has their 'secret way' to do it - but the CHEAP WAY to keep it dark, fresh and ready, is to (once you open the can), break it down in 1-pint zip lock bags - half-cup to 1-cup to a bag, get the air out, then throw all your bags into the freezer. Now, it will last as long as the can's expiration date said it would - without a vacuum sealer, or other expensive contraption. Just write the date on the zip lock bags with a marker. Now they are dark, dry, air-free, and frozen to prevent bacteria growth! I do this with milk powder, too.Oh, did you know, that if you will hard-freeze (below 0-degrees) corn meal and flour in the freezer this same way, for four days when you get it in the store, it will kill all insect eggs (like weevils, etc.) as well as stop rust and bacteria from reducing it's storage life? After four days, you can take it out and store it in your cool pantry, and it will still keep for up to 2-years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EE1XCLAFCNE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098Q3LX0#wasThisHelpful","R3EE1XCLAFCNE8","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great gadget. Add a faucet or a shut-off-valve when you buy it, and you create your own water storage system that can connect to any hosepipe instantly. I actually got this to create an affordable truck-bed water transfer setup, but once I had it, the wife eyed it as a friendly rainbarrel set up for her own uses. Now, there are several laying around here. Good quality, standard threading. Everything you need to put a hosepipe connector on your barrel side, except a drill and drillbit.

"Well, at any form of comparable food like this, you end up with one of two choices - either Ranchers Cut Freeze-Dried Ground Beef, or Libby's Seasoned Beef Crumbles (vacuum-sealed foil pouch, ready-to-eat).The Rancher's Cut is good - but does take a bit of 'experimentation' to get the water right for the end product, and you do need to season it to taste. The Libby's Seasoned Beef Crumbles is about what you would end up with after cooking your own fresh beef in a skillet and crumbling it. It is seasoned to taste already, and no water required. It comes in a foil pouch you could tear open a bit and boil in a pot of water, if in a hurry.As for cost, The Rancher's Cut FDGB is approximately $10 per pound of ready-to-eat meat (about 10-cups of product in a can, and it takes about 2-cups to make a pound of cooked meat in the end). The Libby's is already 'wet' in the pouch, with a pouch weight of 6-oz per, then two pouches can generally replace a pound of equivalent beef (remember, cookdown on 80/20 beef will NOT leave you with 16 ounces of finished meat), then you are looking at about $5 per pound of ready-to-eat meat from the Libby's Seasoned Beef Crumbles. (I have found the Libby's pouches locally for $2 a pouch - but you may pay higher per pouch, depending on your source).While a big fan of the Honeyville brand in general, I wasn't totally impressed with this product. While good, edible food; price point is a tough one on this item, compared to the alternatives (home jerking of meat, Libby's alternative, and home canning, to name a few). The one upside to the Ranchers Cut FDGB is that it has a shelf-life of approximately 15-years (the advantage of most dried and vacuum-sealed foods), while the Libby's Seasoned Beef Crumbles only has a shelf-life of about 2 years.  Both products have great taste, but the LIbby's is ready for you now, where the Ranchers you have to season for yourself.  Both are perfect consistency to make tacos or sloppy joes or spaghetti sauce with meat, in record time.In the end, it really depends on your pantry plans. I have both, myself - but find that the Libby's is a lot easier to grab and toss in a skillet, in a pinch, than working up the Freeze-Dried stuff. Then again, the Freeze Dried stuff can last a LONG time, so buy a can, set it back, and forget it until you need it.  Overall, I gave it a 4-star rating, due to the high price being almost double of it's competitor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P8LNB310JRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096S5U66#wasThisHelpful","R1P8LNB310JRP","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, these are real NSN-numbered mil-spec goggles. These are the same ones I used when in the Marines. I have two of them now (one for my wife, one for me) to use outdoors (you have to live in the Desert Southwest to understand why you need these if you are out in the 'sand'.)That said, I have bought a dozen goggles - from DeWalt construction types, to RZ ATV sport goggles, and even tried dive masks. Nothing, NOTHING out performs these goggles. Here's why:These goggles are made of very soft rubber. The lenses are a polycarbonate piece that can be removed and replaced.  The box comes with the clear lens AND a sunshade lens. You change them by unsnapping two buttons and swapping them in less than a minute. The head-size is adjusted by a simple bunji-type strap (like you find on dive goggles), just put them on your head, and adjust to size. They will fit anyone from a hat-size of 6 up to 8+.As for why they are so great? They have a foam-rubber seal that circles the mask, and vent-holes to prevent fogging that still filter through the 'foam' interior strip. You might feel wind, but you don't get dust in your eyes! I've used them in 100-mph straight-line winds with sandstorms towering 2-miles above the surface - and they work. PERIOD! You can't say anything better about good gear, than it is comfortable to wear, doesn't negatively affect your eyesight range, and that THEY WORK.As for some who say 'the seal leaks', I say 'tighten the straps, you don't understand how to fit a pair of goggles correctly'. People, this isn't casual eye wear. You have to fit them properly for them to work properly. I guess it takes fitting a military gas mask to ensure a proper seal on your face, to understand how to get a seal on protective wear. You aren't slumming on the block when you wear these, you are protecting your eyes. This does NOT mean you have to cinch them down until blood stops flowing, to ensure a good seal, but you can't just throw them on 'with nary a contact point' and expect them to seal, either.As for head-and-face shape and size, related to fitting? They are highly flexible for narrow faces (like smaller people - hey, even my wife has) and for those with larger or broader faces (I wear a 7-3/4 hat size - and they fit me fine too). They are relatively flat when you get them, only a small curve - you get face-fit by fitting them to your head with the retaining strap. The thing that takes the longest to fit these initially, is getting your strap right. Once you have fitted them, you won't have to do it again, the strap is an elastic that will let you stretch it a bit, to take them off without further adjustment.I have had 6-pairs of these over the years. I have NEVER had a bad pair of them, they always fit, they always seal. The lenses are polycarbonate, and can be scratched. That said, they also come with a protective film over them. I recommend leaving it if it has no air bubbles in it. Personally, I have used a single sheet of Saran Wrap over the outer side of the lens before installing it into the rubber frame, to protect the polycarbonate (a lot cheaper to replace Saran Wrap cover, than to replace the lenses). Think of it as 'not convenient tear-offs that don't tear off'.They may look 'uncool', they may not be all chromed out or stylish, but I wouldn't take anything for my dust goggles. Then again, I'd rather use a white 3M N95 respirator mask (for $1 each) and a bandana to cover it, than to pay $20 or more for a pretty toy mask that you constantly have to replace filters on, because it's cool with its little camouflage paint job, too.In the real world, function trumps 'pretty', anyday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MAJVPO2AEC9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SDCIPM#wasThisHelpful","R2MAJVPO2AEC9D","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When these kit-legs came out a few years ago, I bought a set. The first ones weren't so hot, the resin-plastic wasn't formulated right. I bought another set last year, and the resin is good stuff now - about like your top-end plastic resin tool boxes (sun doesn't affect it, nor does cold or age, it seems). For a fast kit if you have the wood laying around to finish it off, it is great (also makes a 'take-down-workbench' possible, that you can transport fairly easily).That said, the kit used to be about $20, and 'acceptable' compared to alternatives. Now, at $60, I have to say, it has priced itself out of the market. Consider, that all it takes to actually make a workbench is 4 legs, which can be made my cutting a 2x4 in half and miter-joining them together with some long sheetrock screws. You can make all four legs in less than an hour if your tools are handy, for about 1/6th of the price of this simple leg kit. Sorry, but I don't see the value in paying 600-percent more for these plastic legs over an all-wood table. If you got fancy, and have a table saw, you actually could even miter-cut the 2x4's for the legs, and make a frame-joint to clean it all up. Make them in 2x6's and double their strength, still for half-the-cost.Sorry, looks neat, seems awesome, but you just can't get past that price-point. If you are able to build a table from this kit, you most likely can also build the legs from wood too.  I gave this 3-stars because of the concept and decent product, but they lose 2-stars for super-over-the-top price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZDRTOHS2MLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SQ365M#wasThisHelpful","R3GZDRTOHS2MLJ","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always hate those review where someone hasn't tried it yet. This isn't one of those reviews.We purchased our Texsport Camouflage Square Dome Tent (that's what they named it when we bought it) back in mid-2009, and set it up in the backyard to inspect it (before going out and getting caught off-guard with it later).  This tent is roomy for a 9x9' tent. Good head height. For me and my husband, lots of good room and space, even with out cots set up. Fly fit good, poles were the shock-rod flex poles, easy enough, and the bottom is a traditional polypropylene 'bathtub' structure, while the upper is basically a coated nylon taffeta that water-repels excellently.We took it down, packed it up, and about 2-weeks later, headed out. We took a trip to a local state park that has a significant wilderness area, and we packed in and stayed for over a week. It rained two of those nights, one significantly. Since we had packed in, we didn't have our cots - just bedrolls with polarfleece and wool blankets and this tent. All went well, the door zipper has an excellent rain fly over it,  the material kept all water out, and we found one small drip point on a seam that let in a few drops of water. No problem that a wax stick won't fix. Done.At the end of our trip, it had fared well, nothing broken, nothing damaged, and we found the one tiny leak point and waxed it.  Our next trip was about a month later, this time 'pickup truck pack-in', for a 2-week stay on a remote property we own. This time, while all went well, we did, unfortunately manage to break one of the black plastic 'snap-on' corner clips in half. It still covered well, but it flapped against the dome pole pretty bad, so we 'chip-clipped' it for the moment to stop wind noise on it. We also had heavy rain a couple of times, once with wind. On the 'wind and rain' night, it was blowing quite hard, and we managed to get a couple of gusts that lofted a little rain under one of the gazebo ends on the fly, which fell through the mesh top into the center of the tent. My guess, it was about 35-mph wind and VERY large, heavy raindrops. (about the same effect if you took a cup of water, and splashed it up under the eave aiming for the tent's roof mesh.The floor tub was excellent, no leaks, again.No troubles with the zippers, the screen mesh is excellent and holds out bugs well, even tiny no-see-ums (very important where we often go to). We do set it up on a 'floor tarp' to keep ground rocks from cutting the tent tub, of course. Inside it has an excellent 'lamp offering' up at the top, so you can hang small battery-powered tent lamps. The rain fly is simple, and quite ingenious. The only negative I could mention, is that in rainy times, it can be a mosquito habitat if you aren't careful. A quick metal chafing dish with a mosquito coil inside the tent can fix that issue, though (careful of sparks and fire, as always). It comes with everything you need but that extra ground-tarp (don't know of any tent that comes with that, though they all should).We've used our tent now for over 52 days of total camping, in all seasons. It has held up EXCELLENTLY. I've seen 'two outing' tents that don't look as good as this still does! Zippers still good, got one little wear place in the tub on a corner where a 'stake pull' is located at that I need to sew up before our next outing - haven't got to that yet, but other than the hole, it still hasn't pulled out!NOBODY makes a better tent for the money. I've seen $600 canvas tents show more damage for less wear-time. If you want a good, solid tent, that packs well (at about 12-pounds, it CAN be backpacked if in a small group), wears excellent, has good water repellency, and is VERY SOLID AND STABLE in wind and weather, choose this one.  Best of all, IT ISN'T PSYCHO-TECNO-COLORED! (I remember when tents were beige, and green, and brown and earthy tones - since when did everyone feel it necessary to make their tents look like CARNIVAL CANDY?! The color is what got me to buy it 5-years ago, the quality guaranteed I will replace it with this same model, when I replace it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJ4WQ8FTF6KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ITVU8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3KJ4WQ8FTF6KH","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, lots of goods-and-bads on this product. Rumor has it, there are refills for it. Bad news, I haven't actually seen them or been able to get ahold of them. You can of course, mold or form your own 'replacement' candle to fit it - but in the end, is it really worth it?As for repelling mosquitoes, well - it kinda does. If you are dealing with the little guys that you see in some backyards, maybe in Europe, hey, seems to work. If you think that this toy is going to repel those gigantic Philippine Tiger Stripe monsters, FORGET IT. They will land on this thing, while it is lit, freebase the fumes, and go on a snarfing munchie spree looking for the nearest vein to pop - ON YOU.This apparently does not work on the Tiger Stripes, and another reviewer has already mentioned that too. The only thing I have found that can keep them off you is actual DEET sprays or heavy lemongrass scent integrated into a citronella smoker. This citronella candle? Forget it, I can't tell if they just don't care, or if the Tiger Stripe mosquitoes are lured to it.  We have a marsh nearby our home, and after taking this out to it (while in my best head bugnet, and long-sleeve shirt and pants), tried this and a dozen other candles and wick burners. The wick burners were the only 'light it and forget it' that could even begin to get the Tiger Stripes away, and any personal spray with 50-percent or more DEET in it.Overall, I rate this 3-stars. It DOES work on little black flies, no-see-ums and regular mosquitoes. This of course, doesn't help if your bug-mix also includes the new adder to America, the Philippine Tiger Stripe mosquito. They are going to have to reformulate to repel these behemoths.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGZJ7FORII5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AMH5QW#wasThisHelpful","R1MGZJ7FORII5","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a 'just bought it review', I've got several of these, and have used them for years. You cannot beat these little lanterns! About 5-years ago, I saw one of these on a shelf in Wal-Mart for $9, on clearance, so I bought it on a whim. Got it home, fired it up that night, and was quite surprised at the amount of light it put out! Compared to a candle lantern, you are talking anywhere from 2-5 times the light of an average candle lantern. In a 12x12 room, or most tents, it is ample light to get around, read a book, find stuff, etc. easily. NOTE: This is NOT a 1000-lumen Coleman White Gas Lantern! You are NOT going to get 'office lighting' level of light out of this. To expect that amount of light out of 3-AA batteries and a few LED Elements is more than a 'touch' of over-expectation. Be for real, this is not a flashlight, it is a lantern with a reflector panel that can drop, or be raised, on one of it's 'triangular' plastic 3 sides. This helps to 'not blind you' when reading, or carrying it in front of you to see your way in the dark. Again, this replaces the need for candles, small oil lamps, tea candle lanterns, survival candle lanterns, etc. IT IS NOT a LARGE LANTERN REPLACEMENT. (you do not buy a half-ton pickup truck expecting to hook-up-to, and haul tractor-trailer loads, and you don't put a ton of cargo into your car. Don't expect unrealistic things from your lantern, either).As for battery life, it is so very hard to address this. The ad says 'up to 125-hours of battery life per replacement', but I killed one set of batteries by leaving the lantern on when in my backpack, once. Another time, I can only guess at how long I used it before the batteries 'got tired', but I'd guess an easy 80-90 hours of pretty-demanding use. I now use rechargeables in it (Eneloops), so with one of these lanterns, the Eneloops, a solar battery charger - hey, this thing is more 'renewable' than a candle lantern! I keep it and a 4-pack of charged Eneloops in my backpack, and never worry about 'no tent light' when camping, EVER.It works great camping (it has a fold-up hanging loop on top, great for some paracord to hang it in the top of your tent, on a tree limb nearby, or fold the loop down and just set it on your kitchen table during a power outage. Simple 'ON', 'OFF' function, no bells-and-whistles, bottom trap-door easily opens to a carrier that holds the three 'AA' batteries (make sure to align the contacts with the carrier and the lantern, when you replace batteries). I haven't had one of my lanterns fail to work yet - and combined, probably have 1100 hours of use on them all. I keep one in my backpack, one in the RV, and one in the kitchen drawer in event of power outage. Knowing where it is, enables me to turn it on, sit it on the table, and begin my hunt for other flashlights, batteries, breakers, etc.Best thing Coleman has come out with in years. It's only a shame that the other new stuff they have come out with recently doesn't measure up to this little guy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37YM54A8MRV8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EH0NLK#wasThisHelpful","R37YM54A8MRV8B","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Five years ago, my wife and I planned on taking a late-fall extended camp trip, and needed some bags that we could actually stand to be comfortable in if it got COLD. We found the Teton Sports XL bags (single size, not the Queen size) rated to -20F, and for about $85 at the time, bought two of them. We took them to the primitive cabin we were going to be staying at, and after some major problems with the wood stove that first night, found the outside thermometer at the cabin saying that the temperature on the front porch was -4F that next morning. I never woke up, I was that comfortable inside. Temp inside had to be less than 10F. That one morning sold me on Teton bags, forevermore.They are super-quilted, love that flannel lining, and the cold-collar-tube, zipper over-cover inside, and the extra collar length at the head all give you the comfort of a square bag, while sealing you up like as if you were in a mummy bag. I have really bad 'cold feet', and after tossing my Zippo hand warmer down into the feet of the bag, had no problem staying 'toasty, all over'. You'd expect to pay a lot more for Teton's quality - and most who never find them, probably do. I've seen $200 bags that can't outperform them. We went back and bought the 'queen size' bag, just for that 'comfort' perspective. The cabin has a 'rope bed frame', and after some 'deep woods engineering', figured out how to comfortably under-support the bags while they are laid on top of that rope frame bed. It's better than being at home!I can't say enough about the Teton bags - buy one, try it out, and you most certainly will be sold after that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQ5QDA6IXTLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F38YI2#wasThisHelpful","R2SQ5QDA6IXTLV","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a joke, 23F/-5C comfort rating? Only if you have the coat of a polar bear already on you. Seriously, a comfort rating is designed to tell you what MOST PEOPLE would find tolerable to camp in. While there is a lot of leeway in a 'comfort rating', it is understood to be what you can 'tolerate' and 'sleep through' for 6-7 hours, without chill causing you to wake, or you to lose core temperature at. Sure, some people have colder feet than others, some have poor circulation, the rating is for 'the 95th percentile', and sadly, no one enforces actual gear ratings. If they did, you'd suddenly see most of the junk like this rated much, much higher. In reality, this is a 'slumber party bag' good for 55F/13C, approximately. Think of it as a thick sheet, at best. For anyone that works for the company that makes this thing, shame on you. You should be made to strip bare, get spritzed with water mist, and made to get in this toy while it's 23F outside and forced to stay there for 7-hours. Uncomfortable? What a joke - you'd be a frozen fishstick in an hour. Don't plan on actually camping in this toy if it isn't July and south of 45-degrees north latitude below 5000 ft elevation. If you actually want a decent 'couples' sleeping bag that can actually give you comfort at 23F, look at the Teton bags. I have three of them, two of which are rated to -20F, and I have actually had a good night's sleep at 0-F in them several times. Cost is actually affordable for them, too. Expect to pay $80-$100, minimum, for a true 20F single bag, $100-$120 for a 20F couples bag. Anything less, and expect used, damaged, or lies.

"First off, this is a serious design copy from the MSR International model of white-gas-stoves. This is one of the first reasons I stopped and looked at it, the concept of my beloved MSR International in a gas version, neat. I picked one up for $15 after reading that it was a 'dual fuel' (butane/propane) gas stove. If it works, can't go wrong, right? Or, so I thought. Well, get it home, open it up, and find out that it is Butane-only out of the box. You have to buy the EXTRA adapter ($8 to $25, depending on mfg) to use the 16-oz propane cylinders with this stove. No free lunches, still, I guess. Maybe that should have ALSO been mentioned in the hype on the box (must have been small-print, like 'batteries not included', but I digress).Well, once I went and bought an adapter for $12 (stove price now at $27, total), I put it all together, screw on a propane tank, light it up - and find that the 'fine adjustment' is either 'overly touchy', or I am just a brute with a fuel valve. I believe the first is more true than the later, as it takes a FINE TOUCH to 'get down to a simmer' without turning it off. Oh well, maybe it behaves better on Butane than propane? Anyway - took it camping (with my MSR fully fueled and with me, as a KNOWN DEPENDABLE BACK UP). I then realized what someone else mentioned - no generator - the little tube gizmo that normally runs across the fire to warm the fuel so it doesn't spit and sputter in cold weather. Guess what: IT SPITS PRETTY BAD in cold weather, and if you aren't careful, and you cook near your tent, your gear, or your clothes, you might just end up on fire to find out first hand what benefits a generator gives you in a stove.Anyway, I packed it up, pulled out my MSR International, and was content to have safe fire without firebomb threat.  As always, you get what you pay for. If you are going to break down and chunk Butane canisters at this beast while it's 70-F outside, enjoy. I wish you luck, and speedy healing. I'll stick with my MSR International White Gas (actually, it is a real dual fuel, but who's counting, right?).I gave this 2 stars because it is actually well-built, and with a few 'polishing points', I would have thought MSR built this - the quality is quite good. That said, MSR would have added a generator, a bottle adapter, better instructions, and probably around $75 to the cost. I just couldn't take this stove to 3-stars, when it advertises butane OR propane, then doesn't give you the adapter they KNOW has to be used to use either fuel. I'd rather they charged me $27 up front, with the adapter, than $15 and leave me trying to find the adapter in the discarded packaging for 2 hours, before realizing that it wasn't there to begin with.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31D1DP1M2L8ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIHT044#wasThisHelpful","R31D1DP1M2L8ZQ","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have one of these Texsport cots (and a lot of other Texsport camping gear). As most Texsport stuff, it is good, as long as you don't try to compare it to the top-end mil-spec stuff. Keep in mind, the real Mil-Spec cot that's been in use for the past 40-years is rated to 1200-pounds (and new, the military paid over $250 for them, each)!As for a good, general cot to get 98-percent of all people off the ground, comfortable, with a rubber mat and sleeping bag laid out on it, you cannot beat this for $60, new. I have two old mil-spec cots (which are near-impossible to get both bars in, after years of age and shrinkage), and the tautness and stability are similar. But, when you go to pick them up, you can tell by the near-double weight, which one is which. Like looking at a half-ton pickup versus a 1-ton pickup - they kinda look alike, but there is a lot of difference in the muscle they each have.I take the mil-spec cot - and it is a head banger, since end-to-end, it's only about 75-inches long. These Texsport cots are about 10-inches longer, and you can feel that added length by not bashing your head on an end-bar. My wife, though short, loves both cots - and can sleep comfortably on both. At 6'2"", I like the general feel of the Texsport better - but like the tighter feel of the mil-spec (were it not for the head-bar).Overall, I give the Texsport a 4-star rating. This is better than any other cot I have seen or used, except the mil-spec cots. Most cots, for big guys, just don't hold up past 3-4 uses. So far, I have yet to break a Texsport King Kot. The price is good for the features, and obviously, Texsport is what Coleman once was (and is no longer). That said, I'd easily recommend the Texsport cot to anyone looking to 'move up' to a tent cot, or just looking to get a good cot and can't locate a mil-spec one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HI1NINM4JL0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V3U9JK#wasThisHelpful","R2HI1NINM4JL0L","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the unfortunate luck to have a family member buy this $180 monster and ask me to join them to test it out. That, and by accepting for me and my husband, set myself up for the following harbinger of complaints that came later (he greatly dislikes Coleman products, stating that they no longer make good camping gear, just cheap Chinese junk that is priced excessively and performs poorly). Here's how this nightmare went:We joined family on a quickly-planned camping trip. Weather was supposed to be clear that weekend, so we just grabbed essentials (folding table, two chairs, sleeping bags, a lantern and fishing gear) and were told that due to 'breaking in their new giant Coleman tent, we had all the tent we would need.' Ok, great, less to pack. Great weather ahead, remember?Well, after running late, can't find anyone selling ice, can't find our food cooler, and a mass run on gasoline for some unknown reason at the local quick store, we took off, and arrived at our family's start point - their front yard. Another two hours to help them load the truck, and now we're all starting to gripe. Another hour-and-a-half, and we are lakeside, about to get dark, and we are rushing to get the lanterns lit, tables set up, and we get the 'advertisement' perspective on the quick 1-min tent setup. Ok, doubtful, my husband jeers as it actually goes up in about 90-seconds. Ok, he's impressed enough to quit inciting family uprising for a moment. We get the bags laid out - and he's complaining about 'where's the tent fly', that's when we learn 'Coleman says this tent doesn't actually require a rain fly'. OMG, the laughter and picking starts up again. So, he quits jabbing about the tent fly, and says 'well, at least with no rain in the forecast, hopefully we won't get to test that claim'. Less than 4-hours later, around midnight, the bottom falls out.IT rained from midnight until mid-day the next day. rain isn't really the word for it, it was more like living under the sea at points. Big, slow, heavy drops - until the air was 100-percent saturated. It only took about 2-hours of high humidity, and we saw the first water pooling in the corners. We hadn't brought cots - running late, of course, so rubber mats were all that was between us and that bathtub floor. Sheer genius design - let the roof and walls be porous enough to be cotton muslin soaking water up, and make the floor waterproof bathtub. Genius. (these were my husband's first words, that very soon, we all were repeating). Water was EVERYWHERE. The inside walls were wet, the door material, the floor, the zippers were allowing soak-thru, the seams likewise. It was like the thing was made of cotton sheets - AND THE WATER WOULDN'T STOP. The absence of a rain fly doubled the misery, as the ceiling was dripping and draping down now, too.We were bailing by sunrise - the air was cold, down to about 50-F, and it was still raining on top of it all. We didn't even have a direction to go to stop the misery, except to pack all the wet up and leave. We packed in the rain, rolled the soaking mop of 200-pounds of tent into an unidentifiable ball, threw it in the truck, along with the 50-pound soaked sleeping bags, grabbed the chairs, tables, etc., and tossed them in as well, and left. We arrived home about the time the rain was letting up.Bad luck? Well, you can't guarantee weather. HOWEVER, you would have been dryer by just sitting under a juniper tree than fooling with this miserable tent failure. Whatever material they CLAIM this tent is made of, clearly WATERPROOF should NEVER enter your mind as an assumption. This thing was miserable. Even a walled canvas tent would have been a thousand times better, at least the water runs off canvas! This thing acted like a sponge, one direction for water flow, INWARDS!The insanity of a tent without water repellency is insane. No rain fly is insane. If you plan on buying and using this thing anywhere that you have 1-percent or more chance of rain, FORGET IT. This nightmare should be labeled 'FOR USE IN SAHARA DESERT, ONLY'. Paying $180 for this tent, another $40 for the rainfly, and then having to buy $40 in Scotchguard just to semi-water-proof it is beyond contemptable - it is downright PROOF that Coleman has NO IDEA what their products are supposed to be used for.Buy any other brand of tent but this one - clearly, Coleman is too busy counting your money to worry about designing your products properly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353D9UJGIDJKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E4IAPU#wasThisHelpful","R353D9UJGIDJKM","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two of these tarps in my camping/survival gear packs for me and my wife. Hers is still in it's wrapper, but I took mine out to inspect it when I bought it 4-years ago. It is on-size at 10x12, and is approx. 10-mils thick. Good Poly tarp with decent grommets. The back-side of mine is 'unprinted' olive-drab color, so a 'wind flip' won't have you staring at a 'white' or blank reverse. As with most heavier PE tarps, you can use them for ground cover under your tent, or even as an emergency tent, itself. The only reason I gave it 4-stars instead of 5 is that when I bought my first two, they were $7.99 each, now they are almost TRIPLE that. Ouch, pricey now. I was going to buy two more and put them back, but at that price, I guess I'll just hold off for now. I love the Texsport gear, and have quite a bit of it (tents, stainless cups, plates, tarps, etc.) but that is a real premium on a PE tarp, just for the sake of that camo print - forget it, I'll just buy an olive drab one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IODHNSOYYID8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LC6DU8#wasThisHelpful","R2IODHNSOYYID8","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used about everything known to mankind, at some point, to keep feet and hands warm. I've always been one to nearly live outdoors anyway. I've tried battery powered stuff, snap-click chemical warmers, the 'rip open' disposable iron-powder warmers, and of course, the old 'solid fuel stick' hand warmers (the red velvet ones, for those who know what I am talking about). NONE COMPARE, and I only wish I had started out using a ZIPPO hand warmer to start with - maybe I'd have learned my lesson quicker.My wife gave me my ZIPPO Hand Warmer for a gift a few years ago, when I had lost my old 'stinky' solid fuel one. I always hated it due to the atrocious smell it makes when lit, but it was fairly dependable for that 2-3 hour 'warm pocket' in even the coldest days. The problem is, well, it stunk a lot, and using it hunting probably kills your chances of not being noticed by at least 50-percent. So, I figured I'd try this warmer instead. My two greatest fears (having used zippo lighters for years) was 'chemical burn' in my pocket from the fuel, and the potential for 'smelling' the lighter fluid (since it uses the same fuel as any zippo or other fuel-type naptha lighter). Well, after a few 'tanks full' of fuel, I found nothing was further from the truth.After you get used to filling it (don't lose the little filler tank that comes with it - can't beat the little 'plastic measuring cup' function for putting just the right amount of fuel into it each time), just fill it, put the catalyst cap back on top (once you puil the two halves apart, there's a little 'button catalyst' that just pulls off, under which is a giant cotton bed for the fuel to be poured), then use a normal lighter of any kind to 'warm and light' the catalyst top, then put the two halves back together. Takes all of 30-seconds if you have your little filler tank ready to pour. I average around 4-5 hours of 'good burn' time, and while it gets toasty, it never gets so hot as to burn you or your clothes. It doesn't smell like a lighter either, once it's going, and I've never had 'naptha burn' like you can get with a lighter when it's in your pocket.Over the past few years, I've learned all sorts of tricks to use it for, too. Like when you are camping, and it's cold outside (I hunt in the winter months), you can fill it up right before bed, toss it into the toe-area of your sleeping bag, and you will have toasty feet all night long! I found out during a long camping trip, that in a 'OMG, I'm out of fuel' that Napthalene, aka Coleman Fuel, will also power this great tool - at least well enough not to hurt it, and to get you through a tough night when you need to stay warm.It is superb quality, as most all Zippo stuff is anyhow, and I wouldn't take ANYTHING for mine, period. Like a Harley, or a Jeep, you can get lots of good stuff for it too, like the metal 'emergency ration' keychain fobs for that 'last dose of fuel' moment, you can get carry cases, and of course, you can get replacement platinum Zippo Catalyst buttons too (though I have used mine a LOT, and have to say, I can't imagine the thing needing a replacement catalyst button - but I guess like Zippo lighter wicks, they must apparently burn out in time - or they wouldn't sell replacements, right?)Don't look at another handwarmer, until you buy one of these first - They really are 'an essential piece' of survival gear, right beside a good knife and stainless steel cup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24NZYTI1YQRZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034C6GDG#wasThisHelpful","R24NZYTI1YQRZE","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a real purist normally about metal fittings. Problem is, they have gotten so junky as of late, that the metal ones leak horribly too. Having worked with a lot of indoor PEX plumbing lately, I've dealt with some indoor plumbing fittings called 'Sharkbites', that are expensive, but wonderful about no-leaks, and durable. I thought, 'man, that would be great to find something like those for hosepipe'. Well, they aren't metal, but these Nelson fittings are 'sharkbites' for hosepipe. They have fingers inside that bite and grip the hose, and the clamp down is solid and secure. I have three of them in operation, one is often under pressures approaching 70-psi, and it has held up for a year with no problems and constant pressure. I am a believer! Not a single drop of water leaked since I started using them. I can't say enough good about them. Once you cut and square your old hose pipe end with a knife or cutoff tool, you don't need tools to put these on, they just press-on, and hand tighten down, right there. No clamping, no wrenches, no screwdrivers, you just tighten them and you are like new again. You can get Male, Female and hose-to-hose joints. I picked up a bunch more, once I saw how good they worked.

"Normally, my wife and I buy the brass Camco water pressure regulators for our RV. If you have ever camped in an RV campsite, you know how the water pressure is - either NO pressure, or enough to carve your initials into steel plate with. Unfortunately, due to heavy salts, iron, etc. in the water at campsites, these regulators normally die after an average year of camping hard. As a result, you have to replace them. Well, this year, we thought we'd save a couple of bucks and buy the Camco plastic pressure regulators shown here. We picked up two of them, and put the first one on. Now mind you, we live in the desert, and it was probably 105-degrees F when I put this one on, in a campsite where the water pressure normally runs 70-psi, anyhow. It took less than a minute, and the blue plastic of the housing softened and the whole pressure regulator blew off the faucet! I tried it again, and within a minute, it did it again. No problem, I thought, just a bad one, let me get the other one and put it on. As soon as I swapped them and turned the water on, it leaked like a sieve. I tightened it to try and get it to stop, and when I had it down to barely a drip, THIS ONE BLEW OFF THE FAUCET, TOO. Sorry, but a pressure regulator that can't stand up to the high side pressure isn't much of a pressure regulator. As always, you get what you pay for. I searched around town, bought two brass regulators, and said forget it, I won't do the junky plastic ones again. BUYER BEWARE, they are NOT durable against any significant pressures.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZDNU3FH0PL98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006IX85U#wasThisHelpful","R1ZDNU3FH0PL98","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up for a .22 LR rifle I have that had a broken older tasco scope on it. I've used Tasco's for years for rimfire, so I'm not a stranger on what to expect from them. This scope is very comparable to most they've ever sold, and the 3x7 variable is a nice 'add on' to the old fixed 4x scopes of past years.When it came in, before ever mounting it, I eyed through it - it is a duplex reticle (thick lines on the outside, fine wires at the cross-point). It didn't mention duplex reticle in the ad, but since most 30/30's are duplex, no big deal there. (for those that don't know, a 30/30 reticle gives you a measure of 30-inches at 100-yards when set at 4x, so you can use it to rangefind on known-distance or known-sized objects). Anyway, the reason for my 4-star instead of 5-star rating? Even though the objective and ocular lenses are round, just like in the picture in this offering, the actual reticle is TV shaped (again, another obscure feature from Tasco from back in the 1970's where the reticle isn't round, it is basically 'oval-shaped' with a 'wide-angle' field of view - something I personally don't care for). Since they didn't mention 'TV' or 'Wide Angle' as a scope feature, I kind of felt misled in the product description. I actually thought they had quit making this reticle form-factor. It seems they have not. It is a decent scope, holds a decent zero on a .22 LR, and the 30/30 feature is quite accurate. Overall, a solid 4-star scope for $20, and should work FINE on any air rifle or rimfire you have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275R8R3CWHX10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y09TVW#wasThisHelpful","R275R8R3CWHX10","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The LARGE LC-1 ALICE pack is an absolutely excellent backpack system, bar none. Read the description carefully, LARGE, because the one that most troops was ever issued was MEDIUM, not LARGE. What's the difference? About DOUBLE the pack capacity on the same aluminum frame and strapping. I have loaded mine to 134-lbs before, with everything inside the nylon. The MEDIUM has three external pockets and webbing for ALICE clips to tie gear onto. The LARGE pack has three LARGE lower pockets, and three smaller TOP pockets on the outside, for a total count of six external pockets, plus lots of strapping. The main compartment is almost twice as large as the MEDIUM, too, and you still have the unvelcro top flap to put maps, the 'against-your-back' T-shirt pouch, etc. Your old 'waterproof bags' will still line this one too, but it's quite a stretch. There is NO WAY you can out-haul this bag. This thing is big, it's mean, it's Marine-Corps-built in toughness, and if you aren't careful, it will surely hurt you it can haul so much.

"For most who have bought a new Coleman lantern in the past 20 years, and it's a 'greenie', then chances are very high that you have either the model 286 or 288 (286 is one-mantle, 288 is 2-mantles). This globe fits both, legitimately (per Coleman), but when you put it onto the 288, it will seem 'a bit small, but functional'. That's because the 288's (at least mine, until I broke my globe) had about 1/8"" greater globe diameter. Still works, still safe, but you'll 'notice the difference'. How do I know? Because I moved and BROKE 3 GLOBES on 3 of my lanterns (still don't know how I broke the one in it's own carry case!). Anyway, if you are like me, and broke more than one, there are deals on 'bulk globes' on Amazon too (5-packs). You can normally score these locally for $12, but if you can't, then watch the shipping fees - they are all over the board, depending on the vendor - from free to $10 per globe shipping.

"Great Lantern - if you understand the difference between White Gas and Kerosene. First off, this is a one-mantle lantern, not two, like the White Gas or Coleman Fuel models, so light is around half as bright. Secondly, the Kerosene used in this is NOT interchangeable with White Gas lanterns at all ('White Gas' or Napthalene, aka Coleman Fuel is much closer to Naptha or lighter fluid than it is Kerosene). Secondly, Kerosene lanterns require a little more post-use maintenance, as Kerosene tends to hold water in the fuel that will cause your fuel tank, tubes and generator to 'rust out' easier - gotta keep them clean to make them work right. If you are looking for a one-fuel lighting answer for a survival situation, this IS THE LANTERN you want, period. Take this, a Kerosun heater, a few hurricane indoor lamps, and you have lighting and indoor heating solved. All you need is some firewood and a 55-gallon barrel of kero to get you through it all. If you are planning for camping, fishing, etc., then you might prefer their White Gas models, or dual-fuel models. For a kero lantern, this is a good lantern, however.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTBUINK8QWGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00168PIQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2KTBUINK8QWGY","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so old, I remember when it came on TV originally. It was, at the time, an amazing show. We talked about it at work for a week afterward (gotta keep in mind, Jaws came out about 6-months earlier, and it headlined at cinemas for over 100-weeks, back then, and Star Wars hadn't been heard of yet). We were amazed that Richard Boone would do a 'creature feature' like this, it really wasn't his style overall. His acting is the powerhouse that sells this show. I went back and watched it a week ago, yes, the CGI wasn't CGI back then, it was rubber suits and Ray Harryhausen's claymation. The actors actually had to get dirty, the costumes are of the era, but the story is still complex, from a time when you actually had complex themes still in movies that the actors had to sell ALL of to make a good show. It is almost two movies in one, it is 'Armageddon' (getting to the dinoland with the Polar Explorer) and Jurrassic Park (OMG the dinos are going to kill us), put together. Yes, it would look great in today's films with CGI 'real life' dinosaurs, a $200-million budget, real-location filming, maybe some real dino-cloning to boot. Since none of that has, or is going to happen, I guess you'll have to watch this EXCELLENT old movie that set the actual genre for 'Jurassic Films' way before it's time, if you want to see a good story with 'at the time', best-resources available. Oh, and FYI, it was NOT a 'B-Movie' when it came out. Being 17 now, spoiled to 'Transformers' doesn't make this any less than the great movie it was then, it just makes it 'a period movie' that shows some of it's age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36L71IW4K66PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TPJNAA#wasThisHelpful","R36L71IW4K66PN","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had this video for years in VHS format, loved it. Would dust it off and play it about once a year. Though I have lived in some really rough 'lower 48' wilderness, I was truly amazed at the resourcefulness and strength of those who were shown in this excellent documentary. Sadly, almost all shown in the video have left the 'bush' for 'civilization', except for Heimo and his wife. There is a 'VICE' documentary on YouTube done in 2011 that kinda follows up to this documentary, but shows only Heimo and his wife 15-years later. It is a real shame that ANWAR and the Dept. of the Interior won't auction the old 'homesteads' off to a new generation willing to 'walk in Heimo's shoes' - but it appears they are gong to lock up ANWAR and cold-storage it for scientists and rich expedition travelers, instead. Such a shame, and lost heritage. If you like the wild, and Alaska, if you watch nothing else but this one documentary, watch it. This is the one you will remember.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3NQLN5GPQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FN2556#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3NQLN5GPQR","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not really sure if everyone else received junk, or if they are just China-bashing again. Oh, well. I have this saw, it stays with my backpack all the time, and has been heavily used in hunting and camping trips for several years. Yes, it is made in China. Yes, it does appear 'flimsy' (hence it being a 'light, tubular design'). The rivet by the tension handle DOES look suspect to breaking, but after cutting the equivalent of several cords of wood with it, I have not broken it. I DID buy a small machine bolt and wing nut, and zip-locked them in the bottom of my backpack, should a broken rivet ever occur - but this is more 'common sense' than equipment doubt, at this point. I have had no failures, except from those 4 American-made 21-inch bowsaw blades that aren't as 'tempered' or 'hardened' as they claimed to be. Seems that the Chinese 'junk' outlasted that 'American Junk' again. Imagine that? Seriously, for the money, this is well-worth the $15 price, and sure beats other higher-priced saws that came from the same Chinese factory, and were re-labeled once they got to America.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KCC8UNCL5OX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005LEXC#wasThisHelpful","R3KCC8UNCL5OX7","A1WV0XTJROAYGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WV0XTJROAYGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product for testing and review purposes at a discounted price.This 50's vintage inspired dress from Blooming Jelly is beautiful.It's a cotton spandex dress with intricate floral pattern in black and purple and white.The bust is draped with a soft silky pleated material that brings a delicate and femine touch.I ordered an XL thinking it would run small but it runs true to size.The XL was too big on the waist and bust so I washed it in the washing machine and stuck it in the dryer.I couldn't believe the dress shrunk and when I put it on the waist, it fit perfect but not so much the bust area so it needed to be pinned with a safety pin.I wore the dress to church and then to the grocery store and received many compliments.Overall, this is truly a gorgeous dress with that 50's vibe and it's available on Amazon and comes in sizes Small through X-Large.A medium would have definately fit better but thank goodness I was able to shrink it and it fits great!Here are some pictures below...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FY63OMJGO6F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01545OARY#wasThisHelpful","R2FY63OMJGO6F4","A3QKWFC92S03MP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QKWFC92S03MP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recieved this product for testing and review purposes.I like using dry shampoos especially when i want to skip a day or 2 from regular shampooing and conditioning.I never knew a dry conditioner existed until now with the Luseta bundle.First of all, the lavender dry shampoo smells wonderful and it really freshened and revived my hair.The day before, I used mousse and spray gel on my hair and the next day it was frizzy, and stiff tangled results as you see in picture number 1 of my selfies.My little side braid had fly aways and not presentable at all.So, I just followed the directions on the can and spray then combed with my fingers and not only did my hair smell wonderful but it was soft. Then I took my brush and brushed it down, my hair was manageable and there was no trace from yesterday's products , it was clean and fresh.Then I added the dry conditioner and it did not smell as good as the lavender but it was still fragranced and it made my hair shiny and bouncy.These are my true and tested results in the pictures below with the Luseta bundle.I did not need to wash my hair by using these fabulous products.Of course, I will use these sparingly because I wash my hair every other day but when I feel lazy or just want to revive my hair in an instant I will use these products.The dry shampoo is a bigger can than the dry conditioner.The lavender dry shampoo is 8.45 fl oz and the dry conditioner is 4.06 fl and these products are flammable so be careful when using it, besides the instructions are on the back of the cans.But the results made my hair alive, smooth and shiny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM3SH5DNJYZXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IL6YBO#wasThisHelpful","RM3SH5DNJYZXE","A3QKWFC92S03MP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QKWFC92S03MP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product for testing and review purposes at a discounted price.I never ventured into the world of liquid latex but when testing it out, it's the coolest thing ever.I decided to make a simple hash wound on my hand.First, I poured some liquid latex on a plate then mixed it in with my mineral foundation loose powder to create skintone.I then mixed it up with a sponge and applied the latex in layers on my hand.This liquid latex by kangaroo dried really quickly which that is a great plus in the art.Now after it dried on my hand I took a tweezer and made a tiny gash then lifted it up more to form a bigger gash.This stuff was strong and thick. Be careful pulling it out is a bit painful especially if you have baby hairs on your hands. So instead of  pulling out the rest, I decided it to roll it off my skin.

"I have enjoyed most of the books in this series, but I found myself ready for a break from it so I hadn't read this next installment until now.  Sometimes being away from something allows us to come back to it with fresh eyes and an renewed enthusiasm.  That was certainly the case here.  Miss Julia is back to her (lovingly) interfering ways as she decides that Hazel Marie needs help with the babies and Uncle Vern who shows up on her doorstep, right at the time when James is out of commission due to a fall.  Miss Julia steps in with a plan to address her lack of cooking skills, a day at the beauty parlor for some much-needed attention, as well as hiring some help for taking care of the twins.  As is usual, Miss Julia's best intentions don't work out quite as planned but everything seems to eventually work itself out.  acThis book is a bit light on the plot and adds recipes at the end of each chapter (which some folks will view as filler), but I still enjoyed it quite a bit.  It was nice getting back to old friends and I found it was easy to settle back into a relaxing, comfortable read.I am giving this 4 stars, which might be a bit generous due to my enthusiasm for the characters after a fairly long absence.  Had I read this one immediately after the last, I think it would have been closer to 3 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKF9VR9BZE63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143124897#wasThisHelpful","R1FKF9VR9BZE63","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have loved all three Tana French books that I have read, including this one.  Set in Dublin, Frank gets sucked back into his dysfunctional family after over 20 years away when the suitcase of a missing young woman in discovered in the walls of an abandoned home.  The owner of the suitcase was (and still is) very important to him and trying to discover what happened to her may be the only thing that would draw him back to the old neighborhood.  The novel has two main themes:  what happened to the woman (mystery), and what was the relationship between them.  As very strong sub-theme is uncovering all the crazy undercurrents, and sometimes outright crazy behavior, of Frank's family and the characters that populate the old neighborhood.An excellent mystery and an excellent look at human relations should have this novel appealing to a broad audience.  One note of warning - the language is pretty raw throughout so if that is something that would really bother you, you might want to pass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0T2Z357KH4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NX764O#wasThisHelpful","RL0T2Z357KH4D","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people have eaten lemon curd which is easy to find in your local grocery store.  While looking at a more exotic grocery, I was wanting something a bit different to serve with scones for a small group I was hosting.  I picked up this lime curd along with another product by this same manufacturer.  It is delicious!  The entire group commented out tasty it was and how smooth the curd tasted compared to lemon curds they had eaten in the past.  This has a mellow, lime flavor rather than having a lot of ""bite"".  It was wonderful on plain scones and I will be looking to buy it again after the current jar is consumed.

"I was looking for something a bit different to serve with tea for a small group book study I was hosting.  I saw these (and knowing the group usually loved to purchase scones in restaurants when available) and decided to give them a try.  I was quite pleased.  They were easy to whip up - only add water - and they baked up quickly.  I used the method of just dropping them on the cookie sheet.  I didn't butter the sheet as recommended, but used a silicone baking mat which made clean up quick.  The scones turned out beautifully and were very light.  I offered lime curd and tangerine marmalade to put on them.  They were so good, the group asked to see the bag so they could purchase it themselves.I am not a cook, nor do I have much interest in spending loads of time in the kitchen, and these were great with little effort on my part.  Will definitely be purchasing again.Note:  If you are not familiar with scones, they are not a very sweet item, so don't expect something along the lines of banana breads or blueberry muffins which are much, much sweeter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWN65VPMB52Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYHEDGG#wasThisHelpful","R2IWN65VPMB52Y","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own two pair of the spa slippers (thong-style) and love them.  I have been in search of something with a closed-toe style for the colder months of the years.  I have tried several more expensive manufacturers and been disappointed with the short length of time before they began falling apart.  I tried a less expensive manufacturer and loved the feel of the slipper, but they only lasted 4 months before the fabric was completely worn through and the stuffing coming out.  I had not ordered these because I was wanting a slide-in style that I didn't have to tuck my heel into.  Since I had such poor luck with other options, I went ahead and purchased these out of desperation.  I bought the black since they were significantly less expensive than the other colors but I was a bit concerned about them showing dirt, and particularly cat hair.Bottom Line, I should have ordered these from the beginning!  The black color does not show dirt at all and the cat hair isn't problem.  While it does take an extra minute to put them on, that is minor compared to the benefits.  The slipper has a strap of fabric across the top with velcro so you can adjust the tightness in the front of the slipper.  There is elastic around the top of the heel section so it is easy to get on and off plus it allows the slipper to conform to your foot, increasing the comfort.  They are well-made and still look just like they did when I took them out of the package.  There is a generous amount of support on the slipper bed so they support the foot nicely.Two things I will bring to your attention.  1) Sizing: I usually wear a size 9 shoe, and sometimes a 9.5.  I originally ordered the large but had to return them since they were too small.  I went with the extra large and they fit will, but aren't any too big.  Based upon my experience, I would assume these run on the small side.  2)  While the slipper bed is well-supported for a slipper, they do bend and flex.  This is fine with me, but if you are are looking for a stiff slipper bed, this isn't for you.Acorn is becoming a brand I trust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VXNI4Y0K78HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025KW4GQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VXNI4Y0K78HL","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are tons of reviews out there regarding this book, so going into plot and story line (which have already been covered) won't add much.  What I would like to do is put my two-cent's worth in and state that I loved this installment in the series.  I have read them all and enjoyed each and every one.  Ms. Penny keeps things fresh and has not fallen into the trap so many authors do of sticking with a formula or putting lots of filler in as the series ages.  One of the things I like most about these books is that they aren't just mysteries;  they are just as much literature/fiction and a close look at relationships between the characters.  This one probably tilted the balance a bit more away from the mystery flavor, but it still kept me guessing throughout the novel.I love her books, I loved this installment, and I can't wait until August to read the next one.

"I purchased the Amazon leather case (expensive) for my first generation Paperwhite.  While I loved it, I didn't love the price so when I was looking for a case for my second generation Paperwhite, I shopped around and found a Fintie case for it -- the brown, map design.  That has been a wonderful case and I actually like it better than the Amazon one due to being lighter weight.  When I purchased a Voyage recently, I immediately knew I was looking for a Fintie case and purchased this one.  After now using it for 6 weeks, here are my impressions:Pros:- price- weight -- very light and adds minimal weight to the device- fit - the Kindle fits securely in the case and the case adds minimal bulk- looks -- nice- auto wake feature -- has yet to fail.  Even better than the previous cover which would fail from time to time.Cons:- the front cover appears to be two separate pieces glued together.  It feels like there is a little ""give"" when I pull open the case.  I have concerns that it will separate at some point- the overall quality doesn't appear to be quite as highBottom Line:  Assuming the case holds up a reasonable period of time, I would still buy this case again.  With the difference in price between the Fintie case and the leather ones, I could replace this one a couple of times and still be money ahead.  With the introduction of new devices every fall, it doesn't serve me well to put too much into a case that won't likely fit the next Kindle introduced.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY91CZ1FSPWX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFICE6K#wasThisHelpful","RY91CZ1FSPWX9","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are just completing a total kitchen remodel and this was the sink we chose.  I knew I didn't want a cast iron sink --- had two of those already and tired of having to work to get scratches from pots and pans removed from the surface.  I wasn't excited about a stainless steel sink as they can be touchy as well regarding water marks.  After quite a bit of research of options, we decided to give this a try.  I have used it now for several weeks and I can't tell you how pleased I am.  I love the composite granite as it always looks good with only rinsing it out from time to time.  What a difference from what I had previously!  I also love the depth of the sink as I can wash things in it without having water all over the counter and floor.  I also am in love with the 60/40 split and the low divide.  I like two sinks rather than one when hand washing items, but find I wash in the larger side and rinse in the smaller.  I also think the low divide allows the handles of larger pots to spill over into the other side of the sink without the pan resting at an odd angle.Beautiful design and beautiful material.  Would highly recommend the composite granite regardless of what sink configuration you prefer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORO6X6UE7U3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0R3OL2#wasThisHelpful","R3ORO6X6UE7U3K","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liz Trenow caught my attention earlier this year when I read The Forgotten Seamstress.  If found that book to be one where I lost myself in the story and enjoyed every single page.  That experience prompted me to go in search of other works by this author and this was the only other one available for Kindle.The product description has a nice synopsis of the storyline so no need to expand on that here.  I do take a different stand on this book being compared to a Nicholas Sparks' ""The Notebook"".  Having read that book as well, this one seems to me to have more substance to it and less romance/lighter fare.  While there is the romantic angle, the historical time period and skill of silk weaving add some heft to keep it from being too fluffy.  One of the strongest aspects of the novel is the main character of Lily.  The development of her as the narrative progresses is excellent and the fact the author shows the reader some of her weaknesses as well as some of her failures make her a character that comes to life.  Ms Trenow has drawn a character I would enjoy meeting in real life.With all the positive aspects of this book, it still didn't grab me the way ""The Forgotten Seamstress"" did.  For me there were some pacing issues in the mid-section and I would have liked to have had the editor take another go at it.  Fortunately, those problems were largely contained in the middle and as I was close to the 60% mark, my interest was back and I found myself happy to be reading.  The other item I took issue with was one of the supporting characters and how he/she was utlized in the book.  I can't say much or I will be giving a spoiler, but I do wish the entire sub-plot had been handled differently.All in all, a good, solid 4-star read.  Will be looking for her other book ""The Poppy Factory"" to be made available on Kindle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MRZQ8B0ZCMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APIVR3G#wasThisHelpful","R5MRZQ8B0ZCMA","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned one Nook and many Kindles over the years and this is hands-down my favorite.  The product line just keeps getting better and better plus I appreciate Amazon listening to their customers and providing page forward and back buttons along with the touch screen.I have both Paperwhites (gen 1 and gen 2) and was debating about getting the Voyage.  A friend strongly encouraged me and I did break down and made the purchase at the end of February.  It was an excellent decision.  First off, I have come to prefer e-readers to paper books so I am generally predisposed to a favorable opinion.  I also much prefer the black and white e-readers to tablets as they most closely simulate the printed page and love the lighting option on the Paperwhites and now the Voyage.If you are a first-time buyer and will use the device primarily for reading , I would recommend you purchase the Voyage.  If you have used e-readers before and are looking to purchase a new one, this is the one I would also recommend you buy.  The pros are numerous and I have found no negatives so far.- contrast and font sharpness are superb- the touch screen is much better and much more responsive than those of the Paperwhite- the page forward and back buttons are a wonderful addition for all kinds of reasons.  Just one of the reasons is that it allows you to hold the Voyage multiples ways and still read easily.  I like the fact my hands don't have to stay in a similar position all the time which can become uncomfortable when reading for extended periods- I didn't really care much about the automatic light adjustment and thought I would most likely turn that feature off.  Instead, I have found it to be wonderful and have left it on.-  the smaller size and lighter weight is a huge plus.  For people who read a lot, every little bit helps and the Voyage is noticeably more comfortable to hold.I have kept my previous devices as back-ups in case I need them, but the Voyage is my reading device of choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPIQYBU79X9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOY8XWQ#wasThisHelpful","RAPIQYBU79X9L","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I, like many others, first became aware of Cheryl Strayed with her book entitled ""Wild"" which chronicled her walk along the Pacific Coast Trail.  It was selected by Oprah and I thought it was one of her better selections.  Ms. Strayed was speaking at a local college earlier this month and I decided to go back and read her freshman effort in preparation for attending her talk.While the book is fiction, it definitely had a familiar theme and was heavily influenced by the loss of the author's mother at a relatively early age.  From both books and hearing the author speak, it appears the death of her mother was the most defining even of her life so far and the hole it left is still obvious even in the present day.The story itself revolves around a young(ish) mother who discovers she has a very aggressive cancer and only a short time to live.  How her live and death impacts her family and how they each hand their grief is the bones of the story.  Her two children are older and their reactions are very different.  One child is out on her own attending college and the other is still in school and living at home.  Her ""husband"" who she never legally married is the love of her life and his way of grieving is very different from what might be expected.A star rating is difficult to assign as I had some very conflicted opinions.  On one hand, the characters are incredibly well fleshed-out and I feel like I came to know them and what they were going through.  The writing is both descriptive and clear which is often times difficult for a writer to pull off.  On the other hand, the main theme is so similar to ""Wild"" that the two books almost merged in my mind.  I would also recommend you take a pass if you are feeling depressed or in need of a lift.  Hard to read and hard to forget.  A well-written book that isn't quite in that top group of stellar books but pretty amazing for a first novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GST7RIM3K0ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092EE9P2#wasThisHelpful","R1GST7RIM3K0ZS","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been searching for a new slipper to where during the warmer, summer months and hadn't found anything I was willing to try until I ran across these.  I LOVE these slippers and have promptly thrown my old ones in the trash.Pros:1)  Try to size.  I wear a size 9 shoe and order the slipper in an 8-9 and they fit perfectly.2)  Contoured back means my heel doesn't slip around3)  Very comfortable, plush fabric covering the entire slipper4)  Love the rubber sole.  I have planters fasciitis and having the rubber sole gives enough support that it helps keep it under control5)  The piece that goes between the toes is very, very comfortable and non-irritating6)  Very reasonable priceCons:  None","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Z6TO5DAP1QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EYQWAO#wasThisHelpful","R32Z6TO5DAP1QU","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have noticed over the years that a singer does well on American Idol but when their CD comes out, it appears they have been ""handled"" and lose what made them interesting and unique.  Their look is polished up and the album seems like many other album being produced today with over-done everything.  I hate that an artist I came to love is no longer recognizable to me and has lost their ""something special"".Fortunately, with Candice Glover, that doesn't appear to have happened.  I do think that an entire album of love songs is a bit much and would have liked lyrics beyond ""I love you and you left me"", but what is here is good.  Her voice is given the opportunity to shine with simple accompaniments being the rule rather than the exception.  She is at her best when the voice is front and center and the piano/guitar/other acoustical instrument is in the background and compliments rather than overpowers. That has largely been accomplished here.Some of the tracks I like better than others which isn't unusual but there is only one track I dislike enough to punch the skip button.  Most are very, very good and I find a couple of the tracks circulating in my head throughout the day.  Track 4 is that way and I find myself hearing the song and her lovely voice even when not actually listening to the music.I would probably give the album a high 4-stars, but since she has managed to release an album that actually sounds like her, I have to give a bonus star for that alone.  I don't know how much control she had over this, but someone, somewhere (and maybe Candice herself) did something right.  Loved her from the beginning of the season and I am so very happy to be able to listen to her gorgeous voice at will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQ4KVGQPX5GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTX6EUG#wasThisHelpful","R1JQ4KVGQPX5GY","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you are just starting out on your journey of de-cluttering or well down the path, this book has something to offer everyone.  The book is short and sweet at only 99 pages and covers both the ""why"" and the ""how"" of de-cluttering.For people who are just starting the journey, I am particularly enthused about the author dealing with the ""why"" portion of de-cluttering.  If you look at the table of contents, the first three sections are dedicated to why de-cluttering is so important.  The remaining four sections are more the ""how to"" instructions for the best way to tackle the project regardless of how much or little you need to do.For people who are already on the journey, it is a motivational/reinforcing book especially the early chapters.  It also gives a few different twists than I have seen previously on the implementation steps.  Very practical and useful.I would encourage you to take a look at the table of contents available via the ""look inside this book"" feature.  It will help you better understand the contents as it is very detailed.As far as my own journey, I have been walking this road for about fifteen years now.  I think I have things pretty well under control and then life throws a curve which creates another need for me to de-clutter.  Mostly this has been due to the constantly changing health situation of my elderly parents.  They have downsized multiple times over the past three years and I have had responsibility for keeping or getting rid of almost everything they owned.  At each step, there has been a huge influx of ""stuff"" that I must make decisions about and then take actionThere are two thoughts I have, one if which is a tad different from the author.  I have found it helpful to de-clutter the entire house prior to deciding on storage solutions for what remains.  If you do her steps perfectly, the storage can be determined as soon as a room is finished but I don't do the steps perfectly.  I end up moving things around the house as I realize that where I have stored things isn't necessarily the optimal location.  If I hold off purchasing storage solutions until the I am finished, I am more likely to buy the right things.The second thought is that the process takes me waaaaaaaay longer than I think it will and is very iterative.  The end results are wonderful and I get motivated by the improvement I see as I go, but this isn't something that I can do over a few weekends.  If you live alone, it might go faster but I have to work with other family members and get their buy in on de-cluttering and that can be a slow, slow process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PINIVGMKEZ24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSM6Z02#wasThisHelpful","R3PINIVGMKEZ24","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in the process of decluttering and organizing and one of the items I decided to purchase as I am doing this, is matching hangers for the master closet.  I purchased 156 of these hangers and each one arrived well-packed, undamaged, and in perfect condition.  I had purchased 10 from a local store and used them prior to making this larger commitment, and I am please with the original ten which I have been using for a while as well as the new ones.The hangers are excellent for hanging my husband's work pants and they don't fall off this hanger. (Note:  even the dry cleaners hangs them separately from the other items in their business since they must be handled carefully or they fall off.)  His long sleeve button-down work shirts fit well on the hanger and his polos and more casual shirts do too.  He also has a bad habit of pulling the shirt off the hanger and the wire hangers were bent and broken with the empty hangers at a crazy angle which looked awful.  His polo shirts also no longer have the pointy shoulder thing as the hanger is contoured correctly and the shirts lay right. I have fleece jackets, turtle-neck sweaters, t-shirts, jeans, dress pants on them and everything works beautifully.In addition, the aesthetics of the closet are wonderful.  I walk in and everything looks so much more organized even though I just changed the hangers.  When I had a mixture of wire hangers, plastic tube hangers, and clear plastic ones, everything looked messy.  As I get older, the pleasure of having things neat and orderly is becoming more important to me.  This was a relatively small investment and the pay-off is high.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJQP1Y97M5QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJ2X8Y8#wasThisHelpful","RNJQP1Y97M5QW","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maeve Binchy is an author who has had a wide following for years, and I am one of her most loyal fans.  Every time I picked up a book by her that I had not read, I was immediately struck by what a wonderful gift she had for making the ordinary, fascinating.  I have also noticed that when talking about books with various friends over the years, everyone loves her work, even with a wide range of reading tastes among us.Ms Binchy passed away in July of 2012 and many of us who loved her work were greatly saddened by this loss.  A new book was published in November of that year which everyone was assuming would be the last.  While I enjoyed it, I didn't feel it had the polish of her previous works.  Low and behold, that novel wasn't  her final publication as her husband, Gordon Snell, collected together short stories that she had hoped would one day be a book but had never been published.  Her husband had the following to say, ""Maeve wrote the stories over several decades, reflecting the city and people of the moment - always with the idea of one day making them into a collection with Chestnut Street as its centre. I am very pleased with the way her editors have now gathered them together as she intended, to make this delightful new Maeve Binchy book Chestnut Street.""It was with eager anticipation and also with  dread that I opened the first pages of this collection and began reading.  What I found inside was a treasure trove of pure Binchy magic and  it is easily one of my favorite Maeve Bindhy works.  That is saying quite a lot as I am not a fan of short stories.  I prefer the novel format with its ability to develop characters and a storyline that allows me to immerse myself in another world.  Short stories usually leave me unsettled as I feel shortchanged when I come abruptly to the end of a narrative I wanted to see continued.  There are only two writers I find myself enjoying their short stories and Maeve Binchy is one of those writers.  Interestingly enough, the other writer is Patrick Taylor, who is also Irish.This collection of 36 shorts stories is like finding 36 small pearls, each one completely formed and luminescent.  She had the unique ability to draw me in with the first sentence and keep me in the palm of her hand for the duration whether it be a four hundred page novel or a two page short story.  This collection is written about a group of folks who live on a fictional street in Dublin and the characters are only loosely connected if they are connected at all.  Some of the stories are pure entertainment and some are life lessons presented as interesting stories.  There actually is a lot of great wisdom about leading a successful and fulfilled life without the reader realizing how deep some of the messages are until the story comes to a close.  I loved, loved, loved this book and am excited for others to be able to partake of the joys of an outstanding body work by this incredible author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TC3ER36V7PN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351852#wasThisHelpful","R2TC3ER36V7PN5","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the Kindle 2nd generation and when it gave up the ghost, I purchased the Kindle Keyboard (no longer available).  Over the years I have owned or used both of those devices along with the Kindle Basic, the Kindle Touch, and the first generation Paperwhite.While I have loved them all, I believe this latest Paperwhite is my favorite.  While I like the manual page-forward and page-backward features of the Kindle Keyboard better than just the tapping you do on this one, that is the only feature that I miss from any of the older models.I have used the first generation Paperwhite and love it but decided to go ahead and get this newer one due to the improved contrast of the screen/text.  As I am getting older and my eyes aren't quite as sharp, the improved contrast really is very helpful.If you have never used an e-reader, I would encourage you to go this route if you are primarily reading books.  This price is a bargain and the ability to increase or decrease the font size at will, the ability to increase or decrease the brightness of the screen, and the non-LCD screen is a huge plus in my opinion since it allows you to read in all kinds of light, including in direct sunlight.  I was one of those people who ""loved the smell and feel of paper books"".  I never thought I would use an e-reader except for travelling when I wanted the convenience of the small size so I didn't take a suitcase of books along on every trip.  Over time, I have come to prefer the Kindle over paper books.  It has reached the point that I will purchase my own e-copy rather than borrowing a paper copy of the same book from a friend.Easy on the eyes, easy to hold (people with arthritis should enjoy the light weight), and so, so, so convenient to have multiple books on hand, and easy to purchase more without leaving the comfort of your own living room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD805N4EP8V31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWH595M#wasThisHelpful","RD805N4EP8V31","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I think of mysteries, what comes to mind most often are the cozy mysteries which I enjoy as a comfort read or suspense/thriller mysteries.  This first book by Tana French is neither of these.  In my mind, it crosses genres by being both literary fiction as well as a mystery.  Louise Penny's books are similar in that way as the mystery drives the plot but the author takes time to flesh out characters and storylines in addition to the central theme.After glancing at a few of the other reviews prior to writing this, they are totally correct in saying there are actually two mysteries --- one in current time and one in the past but both sharing the same geographical area.  One of the mysteries is resolved and tied up very neatly while the other one leaves the reader on slippery ground as the mystery is left unresolved but with some hints at several possible solutions. For me, I actually liked that as it gives me something to ponder and I feel like I was given flexibility to imagine different resolutions.  It also tantalized me a bit and motivates me to move on to the second book in the series where the answer may lie (or not).While I thought the book dragged a bit in the middle and got bogged down which results in a 4-star review rather than a 5-star, it was intriguing, well-written, non-formulaic.  All of which add up to the desire to read The Likeness: A Novel which I have downloaded on my Kindle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TM1F27NAX2W6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U913EI#wasThisHelpful","R2TM1F27NAX2W6","A11XAIFA10G7TS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11XAIFA10G7TS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I were taking a red-eye flight across the country and I bought us each one of these to help us sleep while on the plane.  I purchased one in navy blue (almost black) and black in order to tell them apart.The eye mask:- is very soft, not velour but soft like that and not scratchy- has a roll of fabric which runs along the bottom of the eye mask; it conforms to the contours of the face to keep light from creeping in from the bottom- has a very nice, adjustable clasp in the back; you get it adjusted to the right length and never have to adjust it again since it set from that point on (kind of like a seat belt would be in a car).There are absolutely no negatives that I could find.

"I purchased these pants for my elderly father who was in rehab after a fall.  The therapists indicated that sweatpants would be ideal since he could move easily in them and get them on and off without dealing with buttons or zippers.  He wore them through his time in the rehab hospital and found out he liked them so much, he asked me to order more for him.  He likes them better than track pants and because they are true-to-size with elastic around the bottom, I don't have to hem them either which is really nice.The other thing I have noticed is that they wash well.  He will get stains on them which come out with only adding a spritz of stain remover before going in the washer.

"Well, just in time for Thanksgiving week, here's the final release from Mattel's 2015 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection - Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty (the term given to these little forklift characters who are members of a racer's pit crew.)  Ponchy himself is a single in this collection as well - one of 36 racers from the original ""Cars"" movie's first race at the Motor Speedway of the South, with ""Bumper Save"" as their sponsor.  This little guy was originally released way back in 2010 as part of a Target exclusive 4-pack called ""Team Bumper Save Crew"" that included Ponchy's crew chief and a couple of other pitties, and it's a little surprising that it looks like they didn't make the change to a unibody sculpt as they have with other recent pitties.  As a single, he does come with a little stack of plastic tires (unlike the pitties in the 2-packs of this collection) as they always did, along with his little plastic tool chest (no, it doesn't roll, but the plastic pieces - including those forklift prongs - are quite sturdy.  We've had no issues with the plastic pieces in our grandsons' ever-growing collection of these very nicely detailed and durable models.)The only thing we'd suggest, if you're a beginning collector, is to come up with a strategy!  Many people enjoy starting with either the original movie or its sequel and collecting all of the racers, their pit crew chiefs and pitties (and don't forget their haulers!)  We opted for beginning with the major characters from both movies, then extending out as the years passed into minor characters.  It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of diecast possibilities, so take your time and figure out what you think your youngster would most like to play with first (you'll go broke otherwise... there are a dozen themed collections from Mattel in 2015 alone!)  Others characters in the ""Piston Cup"" collection are Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6C9DE24NG4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WQHCU#wasThisHelpful","RU6C9DE24NG4K","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I had to chuckle when we began looking at Mattel's new 2015 offerings in their small, 1:55 scale line of diecasts, and saw yet ANOTHER Lightning McQueen version!  If you're a parent/grandparent who's thinking about beginning a collection of these diecasts, I'm sure you'll be as confused as we were several years ago when we began collecting for our grandsons... there are a million different versions of him (maybe a million and one!)  There's actually a nice difference with this model (stemming from the original Cars movie) from a somewhat similar model of McQueen with an ""aggressive"" or ""angry"" expression that came out years ago as part of a ""Dinoco Showgirl"" 3-pack, in that this is an all-diecast unibody sculpt (versus the plastic mouthpiece in the former model) - super nice!  And if what you'd like is a McQueen model without his typically smiling facial expression, this is your best bet... it does look like he's gritting his teeth in determination (and also looks a lot more aggressive and angry than the former one, in our opinion!)  You'll love the attention to detail on these models - so very nice, and having the durability to match.The package also includes a poster with a representation of just a fraction of all of the models available within the dozen themed collections Mattel's released this year (so if you're planning on getting just one or two of these guys, better hide that poster before the collecting bug bites!)  We were certainly ""bitten"" by that bug in 2012, and even though we now have innumerable McQueen models, it's always amazed us how youngsters can detect subtle differences long before us older folks can.  The nice thing about this year's collections is the wide variety of both major and minor characters from both the original movie and its sequel, and one thing we've definitely learned the hard way is that the time to purchase is when the models are readily available and reasonably priced (that collecting bug's bite packed quite a ""sting"" several times when we were hunting for older models!)Determined Lightning McQueen is part of the 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection, along with Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, along with 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0MKWW73I093/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WOS1W#wasThisHelpful","R2S0MKWW73I093","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think my husband and I enjoyed the Cars/Cars 2 movies almost as much as our grandsons have, and we've had a heckuva good time building a collection of these little 1:55 scale diecasts for them over the past several years!  Mattel does such a terrific job with the detailing on them, and we can't say enough about their durability.  Once we'd collected all of the main characters, it's been fun for us as the holidays roll around each year to pick and choose which minor characters we might like to add for the boys.  There are a couple of Piston Cup race officials from the original movie - Dexter (the flagman) and Charlie Checker (the pace car) - included in 2015's ""Piston Cup"" collection that we're looking forward to adding this year, to give the boys a little enhanced action during their racing!  (By the way, this 2015 model has a yellow flag as shown in the 3rd photo accompanying this listing, not a green flag as shown in the two packaged photos.)As these small scale models go, Dexter's bigger than most regular car models (just as a compact pickup is larger than a typical car), and we like everything about him... except for a couple of things.  First, in the movie, the flag pole he waves is attached to a thingamabob on his rim, while the diecast has it attached through a small opening near his window - doesn't seem like it would've been that difficult for designers to make it true to the movie's depiction.  The other thing is that he's been released - SEPARATELY - with each of the flags a traditional NASCAR flagman has at his disposal (green for the start of the race, checkered for the end of the race, and - like this model - yellow for ""caution"")... despite this model's great detail and durability, I'm going to deduct a star for what seems like a bit of greed on Mattel's part - since you attach the flag to Dexter after he's opened, why not include all three flags with the model, instead of having to purchase three different models?!  (We certainly won't be making three separate purchases... grandmas have a way of devising solutions to ""problems"" like that, and somehow the grandkids will have all three flags by the time Christmas comes!)There are a dozen different themed collections to choose from this year - Dexter is from the 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection, with the other characters in it being Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, along with 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFO9CTJFQ3V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WOMT0#wasThisHelpful","RPFO9CTJFQ3V8","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun time of the year for my husband and I, as we look through all of the yearly offerings in Mattel's small, 1:55 scale diecast line and decide which minor characters will join the collection we began for our grandsons back in 2012.  With a dozen different themed collections in 2015, there sure is a lot to choose from!  I'm pretty sure we'll be adding Richard, one of three Piston Cup security officers in the original Cars movie.  Richard's the one who helps Motor Speedway of the South team leader Marlon ""Clutches"" McKay push the crowd back while they try to determine who won in the 3-way tie, and he's also seen yelling at the paparazzi, as well as at the Los Angeles Internation near look-alike Marco Axelbender at Speedway near look-alike Marco Axelbender when Marco refuses to admit Fred to pit row without his garage pass. We really like the looks of this ""deluxe"" security van (he's larger than the typical car models in the line, just as a van would be larger than a car in real life)... though we really don't see ANY difference at all between he and Marco, other than the facial expressions on the diecasts!

"Having collected all of Mattel's small, 1:55 scale diecasts of the main characters from the Cars/Cars 2 movies back in 2012, after our oldest grandson had received both DVDs from Santa and fell head over heels, my husband and I have had a great time during the holidays in the years since looking over all of our other options as far as which minor characters to add, trying to get a sampling of each type of vehicle.  Knowing we wanted to add an R.V. this year, we were so excited to see both Doug RM and Larry Camper included in 2015's 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection - we've decided to go with Doug for now, and we know our grandsons (there are now three of them!) will think Doug is so awesome!First, other than his NUMEROUS flag attachments, he's solid diecast!  Certainly a very large model in comparison to the regular Mattel models (just as an R.V. is much larger than a car), and definitely earning its ""deluxe"" category.  The detailing is just SO very nice... love the ridges, the big tires, the color, and the grandkids are going to go nuts over all of those flags!  There's a total of six - one with a Lightning McQueen lightning bolt that attaches to his left side, a flag for multi-time champ Strip ""The King"" Weathers on his right (comes already attached in the package), and four Piston Cup flags (one attaches to the rear, another goes on top, a pole with a double flag attaches to his right.)  Our experience with these models assures us that the flags WILL stay attached during play, and there's some ""give"" to the plastic so that they don't easily break (believe me, that's been tested in our home!)  I like that they're detachable, since we store these in plastic Plano cases with dividers when the grandkids aren't here, and Doug certainly wouldn't fit with them all attached.  We'll probably eventually have to add Larry, since he and Doug are ""best buds"" who've bonded over Piston Cup races, and are seen together at the original movie's first race at the Motor Speedway of the South, along with the tiebreaker at the Los Angeles International Speedway.  (If you've seen the movie, you might recall Doug's funny line, ""Well, dip me in axle grease and call me slick!"")We know this guy will be a favorite when gifts are opened this year!  Along with Doug and Larry, other characters in this year's ""Piston Cup"" collection are Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, along with 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277SQAKH6TX3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCAKCV4#wasThisHelpful","R277SQAKH6TX3J","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we began collecting Mattel's small, 1:55 scale diecasts for our grandsons back in early 2012, there were already SO many models that had been released from both the original movie and its sequel that we had to try to stay focused on getting the major characters first (since my husband DOES intend to actually retire one day, and it'd be nice to have a little money left for that endeavor!)  Now that we've been at it for a while, it's fun for us each year to take a look-see at the new offerings come the holiday season, especially in the way of models that aren't yet part of the collection.We knew we wanted to add a R.V. this year, and this first release of Larry Camper (based on a 1991 Winnebago Itasca and named for his voice actor, Larry Benton) is such a SUPER nicely detailed deluxe model with his Piston Cup flags, dual wheels and ridged detailing on his back section!  With only so many dollars to go around, I think we'll be opting for another model from this 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection (Doug RM), for a few reasons... first, only Larry's cab is diecast (though the rest of him, like other deluxe models we've had, is made of very sturdy plastic) while Doug's completely diecast, Doug's larger than Larry, and - what will interest our grandsons most, we think - is Doug has a lot more flags!  We'll probably eventually add Larry though, since the two of them are best friends who attend both of the original ""Cars"" movie's races - the first at the Motor Speedway of the South, and the tiebreaker at the Los Angeles International Speedway.  (By the way, those plastic flags on Larry WILL stay put and aren't easily breakable, as our experience with Mattel's accessory pieces have proven to us.)Aside from Larry and Doug, other characters in this year's ""Piston Cup"" collection are Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, along with 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHDGAXH6RWFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCAK8NQ#wasThisHelpful","RIHDGAXH6RWFQ","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ponchy is one of the re-releases in Mattel's 2015 ""Piston Cup"" collection, one of a dozen such collections released this year, and the 18-piece collection features several of the 36 racers from the original ""Cars"" movie's first race at the Motor Speedway of the South.  We've been busy collecting these wonderfully durable (small) 1:55 scale models for our grandsons for over 3-1/2 years and have been just so happy with the nice detailing on these models!Though our collection thus far doesn't include any of the minor character racers like Ponchy (been focusing on the main characters and branching out from there), one of the really neat things about him if you're considering a purchase is his unique designing... there are NO other racers among the 36 who have this design!  And his pitty is also a part of this collection, so if you have a youngster who's enthralled with the original movie, it's nice to have some of the previously released models readily available and at a nice price.  Ponchy's sponsor is ""Bumper Save"" (as if you couldn't tell!), and we've always enjoyed the cars-related references throughout the movies, whether it's a character's name, a sponsor, etc... very cleverly done!  We also get a kick out of reading the little bios they put out - they say Ponchy was working as a stunt-double prior to being recruited as a professional race car, which has meant ""a lot less intentional crashing"" (then again, Ponchy hasn't been in the hands of our grandsons yet!)Our own experience with the countless models who call our home ""home"" has been nothing less than super - the grandkids love them, and we've been very impressed with how quality-made they are.  The other characters in this year's ""Piston Cup"" collection are Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338RA4MELN3OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WOP5Q#wasThisHelpful","R338RA4MELN3OQ","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, even though we don't have any of the minor character racers from the original ""Cars"" movie's first race at the Motor Speedway of the South as part of our grandsons' collection yet, we're not going to be able to resist adding Charlie, the official Piston Cup pace car this year!  Seen in both that race as well as the Los Angeles International Speedway tie-breaker between main character Lightning McQueen, main antagonist Chick Hicks, and retiring multi-time Piston Cup champ Strip ""The King"" Weathers, it's Charlie's responsibility to set the pace and positions for a rolling start in warm-up laps prior to the races, as well as returning to control the pace during any hazardous conditions that occur.  There's plenty of racing done in our home with these terrifically durable and nicely detailed (but small) Mattel 1:55 scale models to warrant the necessity of a pace car, given the number of crashes that have occurred over the past (going on) four years!Charlie's been released numerous times before (can't tell from this listing whether he's got yellow tail lights or the correct red ones as seen in the movie - he's been released with both in the past), but it was costly enough just to build up a collection of just the main characters from both of the Cars movie, so it's nice at this point to be able to choose from the HUGE selection of minor characters among the dozen 2015 themed collections Mattel's released this year.  We know the grandkids are going to enjoy having Charlie (part of the 18-piece Piston Cup collection) in the mix now!  Other characters in this particular collection are Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7S6DN6YJUQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WQ9O6#wasThisHelpful","R1C7S6DN6YJUQQ","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my gosh - how's this little guy for a stocking stuffer?!  Gingerbread colored with candy canes shaping his number, with other candy detailing all over him - so very cute!  And the bonus would be that he's one of Mattel's extremely durable 1:55 scale diecasts, a line we've been collecting for our grandsons since 2012 and one we've been so impressed with in terms of both quality and ""play-ability"" in the hands of youngsters who can tend to get pretty aggressive when it comes to racing.Greg - modeled as a Capitol Motors Verve XT - is one of 36 cars who compete in the first race at the Motor Speedway of the South in the original Cars movie, one of two ""Tach-O-Mint"" sponsored cars (the other, Guenther, who's modeled as a 2006 Dodge Charger and also candy-decorated, is Greg's reserve driver in case he's sick or injured.)  This is a GREAT time to purchase a Greg model, since his previous release with rubber tires was a Kmart exclusive years ago (with rubber tires... this one has the typical plastic tires) that's now 4-5 times higher than his original price, and the only other way to get him was in a super exclusive (only 1000 made) pack called ""Motor Speedway of the South"" which contained all 36 racers (I just checked, and it's asking price right now is anywhere from $1,400-$3,000!)  The little ""bio"" the put on on Greg is as cute as he is... apparently the Tack-O-Mint owner's niece is the one who got to choose the designing for this racer (something he's not too keen about!)These Cars/Cars 2 models have been a really nice investment for us, one that I think we enjoy almost as much as our three grandsons!  He's part of 2015's 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection, along with Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BJ124O5OLSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WPDMA#wasThisHelpful","R38BJ124O5OLSL","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our advice to any parents/grandparents who are considering beginning a collection of Mattel's 1:55 scale Cars/Cars 2 models for their youngster is just to make sure you have a strategy in place first... there are SO many models and SO many different ways to collect, it's easy to spend a small fortune, and even easier to get sidetracked from your strategy with all of the cool looking models you'll find!  We've been collecting these for our grandsons for over 3-1/2 years now, and while many people enjoy having a collection of all of the racers, their pitties, crew chiefs and haulers, we decided to start with the main characters from the movies and then be choosy about the minor characters we added... our wallet only opens so far, and this is one of a couple different diecast collections we have going for the grandkids.  We do have a few of the little forklifts, along with Mack (Lightning McQueen's hauler), and if the grandkids remain as enthusiastic about the collection as they are now, we might consider expanding in the future.BUT, if you think you'd prefer to start with the original movie's racers and their racing teams, this is a very nice 2-pack!  It contains both the crew chief and little forklift (called a ""pitty"", in reference to his being a pit crew assistant) for Winford Bradford Rutherford (how do you like THAT name?!), one of 36 cars who compete in the first race at the Motor Speedway of the South in the original movie.  The striking colors and terrific detailing on these models are so sharp.  Both characters have been released before, but we like it that Petrol has a unibody now (with just a slightly different hat and back end than previously released), and there are slight adjustments to the crew chief as well.  If you're worried that the plastic pieces like the chief's headset or Petrol's prongs will easily break off, our experience with them is that they stand up well to the typically aggressive play of the targeted age group, and even though Petrol's little took box is completely plastic (and doesn't actually roll), it's sturdy plastic.  The only reason we're deducting a star is because the pitties have usually come with a little stack of tires, missing in this package, which we always thought was a nice touch.Our grandsons' collection has been a good investment for us - we don't think you can beat them in the durability department, and Mattel's come out with a dozen themed collections for 2015.  This 2-pack is from the 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection, which also includes Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and a 2-pack of Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIY5E12VY5GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4D40JA#wasThisHelpful","R2PIY5E12VY5GI","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There'll be a lot of parents/grandparents out there this Christmas who have a special youngster in their lives just discovering the Cars/Cars 2 movies, possibly looking at beginning a diecast collection of characters from the movie.  2015 is a great year to begin, since Mattel's released a dozen new themed collections which contain both major and minor characters (including both brand new releases along with re-releases) from both movies - the more recent the models, the more readily available and reasonably priced they are!  This 2-pack is from the 18-piece ""Piston Cup"" collection, which also includes Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and a 2-pack of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski.Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks is modeled as a ""Crown Celesta"" (along with other racers like Ryan Shields & Manny Flywheel), his sponsor is Easy Idle (with the slogan ""A warm start to a cold morning""), and he's one of 36 cars who compete in the first race at the Motor Speedway of the South in the original movie.  According to the little bios they put out on these characters, his nickname stems from his easygoing approach to both life and racing.  The little forklift (called a ""pitty"", in reference to his being a pit crew assistant) is diecast with plastic prongs that have a bit of ""give"" to them and won't break off during typical play in our experience, and he comes with a sturdy little plastic toolbox (though the wheels don't actually move).  Both are very nicely detailed and durable models, as all of these small 1:55 scale diecasts from Mattel are!  Think we'll have to deduct one star on this package though, since all of the pitties usually come with a little stack of tires (missing from this 2-pack) - not a big deal, but was always a nice touch.  Both of these characters have been released previously, but this is the first time they've come packaged together... there ARE a few variations between them and previously released models (i.e. Ruby no longer has eyelids that are raised up a bit from the rest of his windshield eyes and he no longer has white teeth in between his lips - at least not on the model we saw - but we think his pitty is a bit nicer as a unibody model who now - ironically - DOES have coloring in between his lips when he didn't in the past!)Some people enjoy having a collection of all of the racers, their pitties, crew chiefs and haulers... this isn't the only diecast collection we have going for the grandkids, so - due to a limited budget, as most folks have - we decided against adding the majority of the little forklifts (though they're SO cute!) and haulers (other than Mack, Lightning McQueen's hauler.)

"Any parent/grandparent whose youngster has only recently discovered the ""Cars/Cars 2"" movies is going to be confused as to who all of the various characters in Mattel's dozen 2015 themed collections are - there are just so many of them!  Some major, some minor... regardless of which version of Sarge you end up purchasing, this is one of those ""must-have's"" in any Cars collection.  Modeled as an early 40's Willys MB army jeep, Sarge is a patriotic WW2 vet - owner of Sarge's Surplus Hut in the small town of Radiator Springs - and his ongoing annoyance with/affection for his hippie friend/neighbor Fillmore is a great example for kids as to how people can have differences can still be friends.  (The excellent character actor, Paul Dooley, gives Sarge a voice in the movie.)Although this version of Sarge holding a (non-removable) plastic gas can has already been released a couple of times before, it's a terrific little 1:55 scale model as he appeared in the original movie when main character Lightning McQueen's new Radiator Springs friends arrived at the big 3-way race in California to serve as his pit crew.  He's part of the 8-piece ""95 Pit Crew"" collection, and another version of Sarge appears in 19-piece ""Radiator Springs"" collection.  We purchased our Sarge model over 3-1/2 years ago, as one of the original numbered singles series stemming from Cars 2 (Race Team Sarge) since those were the most readily available (and most reasonably priced) models at the time, and we have just been SO please with the amount of detail on these models, they can't be beat as far as we're concerned!  Our experience with the little plastic accessories (like that gas can) they use on these diecasts is that they stay put - don't break off during typical play (which means a lot to us, since these models are making their way through three grandsons!)Others in the ""95 Pit Crew"" collection are Pit Crew Member Fillmore, Pit Crew Member Guido, Mater with Sign, Fabulous Doc Hudson with Stand, Pit Crew Member Mack, and a 2-pack of Hydraulic Lightning Ramone & Pit Crew Member Flo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XGMVG4DTHYAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WPBEA#wasThisHelpful","R1XGMVG4DTHYAF","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since we began collecting Mattel's 1:55 scale Cars/Cars 2 diecasts for our grandsons over 3-1/2 years ago, my husband and I have looked forward to the holiday season and checking out any new offerings each year to see which ones we might add.  There are a dozen new themed collections to choose from in 2015 - although Ryan Shields is a re-release, it's always nice when new collectors (or those who, like us, have been in it for a while) can take a closer look at some of the minor characters while they're readily available and reasonably priced!  Modeled as a ""Crown Celesta"" (as are other cars like Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks and Manny Flywheel), Ryan's sponsor is View Zeen Corrective Windshields (ha!), and according to the little bios they put out on these characters, he's also a customer who couldn't drive at 200mph without them!Out of the 36 racers who participate in the first race at the Motor Speedway of the South in the original Cars movie, Ryan's one of 33 who get piled up due to some dirty shenanigans pulled by the movie's main ""bad guy"", Chick Hicks.  (Interesting tidbit... apparently there are 43 cars in a starting field of NASCAR races, which is what the Cars movies are based on, but only 36 appear in the original movie - no one knows where the other 7 are!)  There's a 3 way tie at the end... retiring multi-time Piston Cup champion Strip ""The King"" Weather, main character Lightning McQueen, and Chick Hicks go on to compete again at the Los Angeles Speedway, where it's rumored that whoever performs best will inherit the coveted Dinoco sponsorship upon The King's retirement.  We love Ryan's predominant turquoise coloring (a bit lighter on his doors), and all of the great detailing that is commonplace with these Mattel models.While nice detailing is great, the name of the game for us when it comes to collecting for three youngsters who are subjecting these diecasts to some pretty heavy-handed racing, crashing, etc., is how durable are they?  VERY!  This has been a very nice investment for us, and one we highly recommend.

"Well, it's that fun time of year again when my husband and I enjoy looking through all of Mattel's latest 1:55 scale diecasts to see which ones we'll add to the collection we began for our grandsons going on four years ago, and they've come out with a dozen new themed collections for 2015 so there's a lot to peruse!  This listing's a little confusing, since it shows Kevin with predominantly red coloring... the interesting thing is that even though he WAS actually released with that color in his initial releases, his predominant color in the movie is just as it appears on the packaging - hot pink - and though he appeared early in 2015 in the exact same packaging with his red paint job, they've corrected it so hopefully what you'll get is the revised, hot pink version.Kevin's one of the 36 racers who took part in the first race in the original Cars movie (one of the first to be hit in a big crash) at the Motor Speedway of the South, from which - after a 3 way tie with multi-time Piston Cup champion Strip ""The King"" Weathers - main character Lightning McQueen and the film's primary antagonist, Chick Hicks, go on to the Los Angeles Speedway to determine who might get the coveted Dinoco sponsorship after The King's retirement.  Don't you love that determined look on Kevin's face, and the great detailing with all of those decals?  He's designed as a Capitol Motors Verve XT, and the ""Shifty Drug"" logo you see is his sponsor... according to the little bios they put out on these characters, he doesn't have much going in terms of natural ability or knowledge of the rules/history of racing, but thanks to an in-law owning the big pharmaceutical company who sponsors him, he's been able to stay on the circuit!What we can tell you from years of collecting these diecasts is that they're as durable as they are detailed - when our middle grandson isn't able to destroy something, it's darned near well indestructible!  The others in the 18-piece ""Piston Cup Collection"" are Chick Hicks, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, My Name Is Not Chuck with Cart, Larry Camper, and 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHV99HXRMYYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WP3NO#wasThisHelpful","R3OHV99HXRMYYH","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There've been COUNTLESS releases of Chick Hicks (primary antagonist from the original Cars movie) since Mattel began producing their line of terrifically detailed and durable 1:55 scale diecasts... this one's the latest, from the 18-piece Piston Cup Collection, which means it's widely available and reasonably priced - good news for beginning collectors (he's @3-3/16""L, 1""H, 1-3/8""W).  We didn't begin collecting these models until after the 2011 Cars 2 sequel came out (our oldest grandson was about to turn 4), and though we began just with the Cars 2 models (which, for us, were the most recent and readily available), we also tried to pick up the main characters from the original movie as well.  We ended up with the model that had the little Piston Cup trophy included, but there are SO many versions so be sure to check them all out before settling on one, if you're a parent/grandparent whose youngster has just discovered them.  One thing's certain, though - any collection of diecasts from the original film HAS to have Chick!You'll be amazed at the detailing that goes into these little diecasts, especially Chick with his (we heard) 334 decals!  He's designed as a 1987 Buick Grand National, his sponsor's name (Hostile Takeover Bank, or htB) is seen in several places, and his number (86) is in honor of the year Pixar came into existence.  Both he and main character Lightning McQueen end up in a race against mutli-Piston Cup winner Strip ""The King"" Weathers... The King is about to retire, and his highly coveted Dinoco sponsorship is being rumored to go to whomever wins the race.  Though both racers begin the movie as arrogant, full-of-themselves personalities, McQueen ""grows up"" with the help of his newfound, small town Radiator Springs friends, learning the importance of fair play and teamworks, while Chick - despite ultimately winning the race after some nasty shenanigans during the final lap - ends up with an ""empty cup""... his cheating to win the race gets him no where when it comes to fan support OR the Dinoco sponsorship.We've had two more grandsons since we began collecting, and we've really been pleased with the quality of these diecasts and how much enjoyment the boys (and us!) have had with them.

"One of the things my husband and I have enjoyed about the Cars/Cars 2 movies is how many ""teachable moments"" have resulted with our grandkids, as we've been collecting Mattel's small, 1:55 scale diecasts since our oldest grandson's 4th birthday back in 2012.  (And when I say ""small"", diecast ""Not Chuck"" is @ 1-7/8"" from his rear to the tip of his fork prong, 1-1/8""H, 15/16""W, while his plastic tool box is @ 1-1/8""L, 1-3/16""H, 7/8""W.)  If you're a parent/grandparents who's unfamiliar with the original Cars film, ""Not Chuck"" (humorously, voiced by a San Francisco DJ/actor named Mike ""No Name"" Nelson!), is designed as a 2003 Nemomatic forklift, and is main character Lightning McQueen's temporary crew chief (with McQueen having fired the first one) in the original, 36-car race at the Motor Speedway of the South.  At the beginning of the movie, McQueen is a super arrogant race car (he matures as the movie progresses), and he ignores Not Chuck's advice during a pitstop to change his tires - McQueen insists on gas only so he can quickly return to the race (ending up with burst rear tires!)  McQueen does eventually end up in a 3-way tie at the end of this first race, and during an interview, he dismissively tells this little forklift - whose name he hasn't even bothered to learn - to get out of the way of a camera shot, saying ""Yo, Chuck.  Chuck, what are you doing?  You're blockin' the camera!  Everyone wants to see the bolt.""  The forklift has had enough, gathers the other pit crew members together and says, ""We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!""  McQueen sarcastically asks how he'll ever be able to find someone else who knows how to fill him up with gas, finishing with ""Adios, Chuck!""  As his crew stomps off, the forklift responds, ""And my name is not Chuck!""SO... we had to chuckle when our grandson opened his model, with packaging reading ""My Name Is Not Chuck"", and said ""But Grandma, his name IS Chuck!  That's what Lightning calls him!""  As adults, we tend to forget that some of the nuances of a movie can be lost on youngsters, and we used the opportunity to talk about the concept of ""team"" (... ""How would you feel if we colored a picture together, and when someone complimented it, I pretended I colored it all by myself?"", going on to the longer explanation that McQueen wouldn't have been able to be one of the three winners if it hadn't been for the team who helped him.)  Anyway, we love all of the little details on these Mattel models - we keep adding more, now have a couple of additional grandsons who are enjoying them as well, and they are very durable models that can withstand a LOT of punishment.  Even the plastic pieces attached to the diecasts (like Not Chuck's prongs) and the props like that tool box are amazingly durable (ours came with a little stack of 4 tires, while it looks like the re-release has only 2... just be careful - we lost ours, and you don't want a baby/toddler getting hold of that little piece and popping it in their mouth!)  There are innumerable little forklift characters in this diecast line... can't afford to collect them all, but given his role in the film, we HAD to have this little guy... whatever his real name may be!This model is being re-released as part of 2015's 18-piece ""Piston Cup Collection"", with the others being Chick Hicks, Kevin Racingtire, Ponchy Wipeout, Richard Clayton Kensington, Greg Candyman, Dexter Hoover, Ryan Shields, Charlie Checker, Determined Lightning McQueen, Mario Andretti, Ponchy Wipeout's Pitty, Doug RM, Larry Camper, and 2-packs of Chief RPM/Petrol Pulaski and Ruby ""Easy"" Oaks/Easy Idle Pitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZV4PG7CVYSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WOUTW#wasThisHelpful","R7ZV4PG7CVYSG","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though we already have a version of the Fabulous Hudson Hornet as part of the collection of Mattel's terrific (small) 1:55 scale diecasts we began for our grandsons going on four years ago, I have to say that it is SOOOOO tempting to add this 2015 ""deluxe"" model from the 8-piece ""95 Pit Crew"" collection... it is, as our grandsons would say, absolutely ""AWESOME!""  Even though he's been released with a headset before (our model didn't have one), this is the first time he comes with the cool stand he's seen sitting on in the original Cars movie, as main character Lightning McQueen's pit crew chief, when all of his new small town Radiator Spring friends show up to serve as his pit crew during the big 3-way race in California!  Though the stand is plastic, our experience with all of the plastic accessories in the Mattel line are super, super durable, and it's just so neat - both the diecast model and the stand are so amazingly detailed... the top of the stand even has a piece that flips over to become a ramp for him to drive up onto his perch for the race, the antenna moves up and down, and - unlike so many other of the little tool boxes in the Mattel line, this one actually rolls!  The only thing that would make it cooler would be if those side panel doors went up and down.  Just an excellent ""deluxe"" package.If you're a parent/grandparent unfamiliar with the ""Cars/Cars 2"" movies, here's a bit of info about Doc.  First, you KNOW he has to be a great character in order for the Disney/Pixar producers to convince Paul Newman to give him a voice!  In the original movie, he's known as ""Doc Hudson""... he'd been a former 3-time Piston Cup champion racer in his early days, until a terrible crash during the 1954 Piston Cup's final lap sidelined him, and his attempt to return to the racing circuit was met by taunts of being a ""has-been"".  He became jaded and gave it all up, studied medicine and became a ""doctor of internal combustion"" (don't you love it?), disappearing into the small town of Radiator Springs and opening Doc's Clinic (while also serving as the town judge.)  When famous (and arrogant) race car McQueen accidentally becomes ""lost"" in the small town on his way to the California race, Doc and the other characters become his new friends, and Doc (who as a physician/judge sports a dignified dark blue color in the town), dons his Fabulous Hudson Hornet attire when they all travel to replace the former pit crew who'd justifiably quit on McQueen due to said arrogance.Doc is designed as a '51 (what else?!) Hudson Hornet, and we thought it was so poignant that - after the death of Paul Newman - the producers decided that Doc himself would have already passed away when the sequel came out (though he's referred to several times in the movie)... a very classy move in our opinion!  We love our Fabulous Hudson Hornet model, and as far as we're concerned, this deluxe model is a ""no-brainer"" if you're just starting a collection - readily available and reasonably priced.  There IS a plain blue Doc Hudson as well, in 2015's 19-piece ""Radiator Springs"" collection, if your budget allows for two different models of him!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BZ67WYQAN9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCAKCW8#wasThisHelpful","R20BZ67WYQAN9P","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are ""must have's"" and ""nice-to-have's"" if you're thinking about starting a collection of Mattel's small, 1:55 scale Cars/Cars 2 diecasts for a special young person in your life... the characters of Ramone and Flo are ""must have's"" (though maybe not these particular scene-specific models stemming from the original movie - but they're definitely ""nice-to-have's"", and part of 2015's 8-piece ""95 Pit Crew"" collection, along with Pit Crew Member Sarge, Pit Crew Member Fillmore, Pit Crew Member Guido, Mater with Sign, Fabulous Doc Hudson with Stand, and Pit Crew Member Mack.)  Other readily available and reasonably priced models of both Ramone and Flo as singles are in 2015's 19-piece Radiator Springs collection, so be sure to check both out before making a purchase to see which you think your youngster would like best!If you're a parent/grandparents who's learning about the Cars/Cars 2 characters right along with your youngster, that's exactly what we were doing several years ago when we began a collection of these terrifically detailed and oh-so-unbelievably durable diecasts for our grandsons!  Ramone (designed as a 1959 Chevrolet Impala Lowrider, with a license plate that reads ""LOW N SLO""!) is a very colorful - both literally and personality-wise! - character who owns Radiator Springs' ""Ramone's House of Body Art"", whose had innumerable paint jobs (in this 2-pack, he has the red body with yellow flames in support of main character Lightning McQueen, as depicted in the original movie.  Though Ramone's been released several times prior with the same paint job, this is the first time he has his hydraulic suspension lifting him up for a better view!)  He's married to the owner of the the local fuel diner next door to his store, Flo, who's quite a character herself!  She's modeled as a composite of a few different 1950's ""show cars"" (sporting the license plate ""SHOGRL""), and this 2-pack has her equipped with a (non-removable) side tray with a gas can sitting on top, ready to help McQueen is whatever way she can in trying to win the big 3-way race in California.  (You might think that little plastic tray would pop right off of the diecast, but we can tell you from experience that all of the little plastic pieces on these models are attached in such a way that we've never had any break off over the course of going on four years, and now three grandsons actively playing with them.)There are SO many past models of both of these characters available, so be sure to check all of them out and see which ones you think best fit not only your youngster's taste, but your budget as well!  We have a couple of Ramone models that were part of the original numbered series stemming from the Cars 2 movie (which, for us, were the most readily available/cost efficient models at the time we began) - a purple Hydraulic Ramone and a Radiator Springs Ramone), but the only Flo model we have is one of Disney Store's larger (1:43 scale), heavier models - she's gorgeous (as all Flo models are!), but we'll be adding the single from the Radiator Springs collection this year.

"We were a little surprised, when we saw Mattel's dozen 2015 themed collections of 1:55 scale diecasts, that they included Guido in the 8-piece ""95 Pit Crew"" series but not Luigi!  Guido - modeled as an Alza/Tutto forklift - is the Italian speaking best friend/assistant to the owner of Radiator Spring's ""Casa Della Tires"", and both of them are a part of the small town group who rally to become main character Lightning McQueen's new pit crew in the original Cars movie.  This model of Guido - with his little plastic screw driver in hand, and little plastic tire stack and tool box accessories included - had been previously released, but what about Luigi?!  Not including both is like having salt without pepper, in our opinion... if you're thinking about starting a collection for your youngster, and have a limited budget (as we did!), even though this scene-specific model with accessories is cute, we suggest taking a look at the Luigi & Guido 2-pack from 2015's Radiator Springs collection.Keep in mind that Guido is SUPER tiny in a line of diecasts that's already small (@ 1-5/8""L, 3/4""W, 1-1/16""H), but it's part of what makes him so irresistibly adorable in our opinion!  We'd begun a collection of these diecasts for our grandsons over 3-1/2 years ago, and have been so impressed with their quality - both in detailing AND durability!  We loved Disney Store's larger (1:43 scale), heavier models, but they were more brittle and we just didn't feel they held up as well.  Our experience with all of the little plastic pieces on Mattel's diecasts, as well as any plastic accessories included, has been great in that they use a highly durable plastic that doesn't break with the normal wear and tear youngsters put toys like this through - including intentional crashing, etc.!  Other characters in this ""95 Pit Crew"" collection are Pit Crew Member Sarge, Pit Crew Member Fillmore, Mater with Sign, Fabulous Doc Hudson with Stand, Pit Crew Member Mack, and a 2-pack of Hydraulic Lightning Ramone & Pit Crew Member Flo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJMR0UECPQHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WQCDO#wasThisHelpful","R1PJMR0UECPQHK","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Starting to look into collecting Cars/Cars 2 diecasts for some special youngster in your life?  We've been collecting Mattel's small, 1:55 scale diecasts for our grandsons going on four years now, and we swear by their terrific detailing and the fact that our middle grandson, who's especially tough on toys, hasn't been able to mangle them despite his best efforts!  2015 is a great year to start collecting, since Mattel's come out with a dozen themed collections of both major and minor characters from both movies - it's just a matter of deciding where you want to begin, and Fillmore - is one of those loveable Radiator Springs characters who appeared in both movies, so regardless of which model you decide on, he's on the ""short list"" of must-have's.Modeled as a 1960 VW bus, popular with ""hippies"" from the 60's, this colorful (figuratively AND literally!) character runs Radiator Springs ""Fillmore's Taste-In"", where you can always pick up a tie-dyed mud flap or some of his organic home-brewed fuel.  Though his WWII vet neighbor Sarge isn't too happy about his psychedelic symbols, crazy lawn ornaments or unkept lawn, they're good friends and are among the small town characters who become main character Lightning McQueen's pit crew during the big 3-way California race at the end of the original movie.  That's what this particular Fillmore model stems from, with little (non-detachable, plastic) gas cans tucked into his headband!  (We thought it was a stroke of genius for Disney/Pixar to recruit George Carlin to give him his voice in the original Cars and, though Lloyd Sherr did a great job in taking over the role in the sequel, it was just so sad that Carlin himself passed away before he could reprise his role.)We purchased our grandsons' Fillmore model as part of the original numbered singles stemming from Cars 2 (Race Team Fillmore) since it was the most readily available and most reasonably priced model, and there are a couple of Fillmore choices in Mattel's 2015 collections... this one is from the 8-piece ""95 Pit Crew"" collection (which also includes Pit Crew Member Sarge, Pit Crew Member Guido, Mater with Sign, Fabulous Doc Hudson with Stand, Pit Crew Member Mack, and a 2-pack of Hydraulic Lightning Ramone & Pit Crew Member Flo), and another - without the gas cans - in the 19-piece ""Radiator Springs"" collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RA0ZXICQ8CZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WORXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RA0ZXICQ8CZF","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I wonder if Mattel itself has kept track of how many different versions of its small, 1:55 scale Mater models its released!  We began collecting these wonderfully detailed, equally durable models over 3-1/2 years ago... our Mattel model is from the original numbered series that came out after Cars 2 - Race Team Mater - because they were more readily available (and more reasonably priced) than the older models from the original Cars movie, but we've got a ton of Disney Store's larger (1:43 scale), heavier Mater models as well that we'd collected prior to deciding to go with Mattel for the vast majority of our grandsons' collection, finding them just all around more durable.  Even having collected all of these years, it's hard for US to keep track of all of the different Mattel models!If your a parent/grandparent with a youngster who's developed an interest in the movies but not too familiar with them yourself, Mater is main character Lightning McQueen's best friend, and we challenge anyone to find a reason NOT to love Mater!  Back home in the small town of Radiator Springs (where famous race car McQueen gets ""lost"" on his way to a big race in California), he runs Tow Mater's Towing & Salvage as well as the local impound lot.  His character is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy in the movies, and he's an absolutely hilarious, down-home, devoted and loyal guy, whose body is shaped like an old '50s tow truck, resembling a 1951 International Harvester L-170 ""boom"" truck with some mid-'50s Chevy qualities mixed in.You can't have a Cars collection of ANY kind without Mater, and among Mattel's dozen 2015 themed collections, there are a few models available - this one, holding a ""Radiator Springs Racing Team"" sign (as he did in the original movie when all of McQueen's new Radiator Springs friends saved the day by becoming his new pit crew after his original crew had quit due to McQueen's initial arrogance) as part of the 8-piece ""95 Pit Crew"" collection, as well as Mater and Brand New Mater from the 19-piece ""Radiator Springs"" Collection.  Be sure to check them all out before deciding, if your budget's got a limit (as ours does!)

"2015 is a great year for any parents/grandparents out there who have a special youngster in their life who's just discovering ""Cars/Cars2"" - SO many nice choices in Mattel's dozen themed collections of 1:55 scale diecasts!  As far as we're concerned, Mack - whether this one, which has him featured as Lightning McQueen's ""interim"" crew chief in the original movie, or one of the many other models with haulers - is a character you've GOT to have!  After all, if it wasn't for Mack getting spooked by the ""delinquent road hazards"" and accidentally emptying Lightning out of his hauler in Radiator Springs, we would never have met all of the endearing characters who live in that small town, and not only became his pit crew after the once arrogant McQueen's original pit crew quit (with good reason!), but also showed him that friendship and loyalty were a heckuvalot more important than winning!Mack's a friendly, seasoned professional hauler for main character Lightning McQueen of the ""Cars/Cars 2"", based on a 1980's era Mack Super-Line truck, (and voiced by John Ratzenberger - ""Cliff Clavin"" of ""Cheers"" fame in the movies). This ""deluxe"" model is a long-awaited version of Mack, the first to feature him with his racing headgear and oil/gas cans attached to his front... it's how he appears in California at the three-way race between Strip ""The King"" Weathers, a retiring Piston Cup Champ, and the two racers who hope to inherit the coveted Dinoco sponsorship after him... McQueen and the movie's main antagonist, Chick Hicks.  You DO have a decision to make, though. if your budget is limited (as ours is, and has been since we began collecting these terrifically durable Mattel models for our grandsons over 3-1/2 years ago)... is this the version you want (there's no hole on his rear to connect a trailer up to), or do you want one of the Mack haulers?  Years ago, we'd purchased the transforming hauler version of Mack, and it's been great, but it's probably a lot more expensive now.  This Pit Crew Member Mack model is just chock full of so many terrific details, so if you decide to just go without a trailer, we're certain you won't be disappointed in having him represent Lightning McQueen's loyal hauler!We really do love both the models and the endless hours of enjoyment our grandsons have had with them!

"When my husband and I saw Mattel's new 1:55 scale Terry Gong model (only Terry is diecast... the rest of this ""deluxe"" package is plastic, and unfortunately no, the gong doesn't make a sound), I asked him if he remembered ""The Gong Show"", and we had a good laugh over the fact that not only our grandsons, but SONS would not even remember it, that's how old we are!  It also made it a certainty that we'll have to add this to our grandsons' collection (even though it has NOTHING to do with ""The Gong Show"", which was a silly show where contestants - who were most often lacking in the talent department - would be judged by a celebrity panel who would ""gong"" the really bad acts!)  In ""Cars 2"", when Lightning and his team arrive in Tokyo for the first leg of the World Grand Prix race, they travel through the city taking in many different sights, during which an old top 10 hit by ""The Cars"" (how appropriate!) called ""You Might Think"" was being sung (though by a different group) - they end up in the Tokyo National Arts Center and, as the song ends, Terry (whom you see for maybe all of two seconds!) hits the gong, which makes a reverberating sound - very cool!This is such a unique little package... Terry's modeled as an Alza Facile utility vehicle (a Tutto, same as Guido, which means ""everything up"" in Italian!), and your youngster can insert the tip of one of his forklift prongs into a little circular piece on the end of the ""thingie"" to hit the gong (don't you love my official terminology... ""thingie""?)  We think our grandsons will really get a kick out of this, and we're not concerned about the heavy amount of plastic used in this... we've been collecting these small Mattel Cars/Cars 2 diecasts for going on four years now, and our experience of the plastic used as decor with the models is that it's a of sturdy consistency which hold up well to typical play.Lots of neat new characters in the dozen 2015 themed collections Mattel's come out with this year that we're excited about adding!

"Some people think Professor Z is the main ""bad guy"" in Cars 2... but it's actually Miles Axlerod who's the REAL ""evil behind the evil""!  Designed as a green Range Rover L322, at first you Sir Miles is a great guy - organizing the 3-country World Grand Prix race to promote his renewable, clean-burning fuel Allinol, throwing great parties... well, he ends up being the one behind a secret plot to actually turn the world AGAINST alternative energy, and to rely more heavily on traditional gas (since he and the ""Lemon"" families own the world's largest untapped oil reserves!)  Even his license plate (it says ""ALT NRG""!) is part of his spiel!We purchased one of Mattel's small, 1:55 scale Miles Axlerod models @ 3-1/2 years ago as part of collection for our grandsons, and these models are just terrific in terms of durability and detailing.  One thing I do want to point out, though, is (at least as of this writing), the photo accompanying this listing isn't accurate... ""Miles Axlerod with Microphone"" - part of 2015's 10-piece ""Tokyo Party"" collection - has an open mouth and a little plastic floor microphone (that you'll need to keep out of reach of any infants/toddlers in the house.)  There are a couple of points during Cars 2 that he's using a mic (at the Tokyo welcoming party, again on the ""Mel Dorado Show""), and though we do like the fact that the model accurately depicts the chrome grille and clear plastic over the headlights as the character does in the movie, we prefer our model (one of the original numbered singles,with his frowning face, since we think it more accurately reflects who he is.  In fact, the photo accompanying this listing looks like our model!)BUT, what you do get by purchasing this one is a readily available (and therefore reasonably priced) model, as compared to higher prices on the older models.  For someone just beginning a collection, we know how important reasonable prices are because we went through the same thing!

"With three grandsons, I've always appreciated when the toy lines they're interested in and we've started collections of (i.e. Thomas the Train, Disney/Pixar's Cars/Cars 2 and Planes/Fire & Rescue) have some strong female characters in the mix, and Holley Shiftwell certainly qualifies!  The Holley model we purchased back in early 2012 doesn't sit on the sidelines - designed as a Jaguar XJR-15, this gorgeous purple British spy car works with Finn McMissile and she's loaded with spy gadgetry... an on-board computer, projection lamps, dual mounted trackball platforms, headlight cameras, digital readouts, retractable wings, her front wheels have concealed guns, an electroshock device, and a telescoping utility arm - wowsers!

"For parents/grandparents who are considering starting a collection of Mattel's small, 1:55 scale Cars/Cars 2 diecasts for some special youngster they know, we can tell you from going on four years of doing the same for our three grandsons that you can't beat the durability of these little models - all of them are so nicely detailed (with NO paper stickers to start peeling off!), and the Acer model we purchased in early 2012 is still in SUPER shape (well, as good of shape as a car INTENTIONALLY designed as a beat up old 1975 AMC Pacer is supposed to be in!)  Any basic Cars 2 collection has to have Acer and his cohort (Grem) - as evil Professor Z's henchmen, they're the ones who chase Mater (mistakenly thinking he's an American spy) around the world during the 3-country World Grand Prix race.  Mattel's 2015 themed collection have three different offerings of Acer - this one that's part of the 10-piece ""Tokyo Party"" collection, a ""deluxe"" model that comes with a luggage cart in the 6-piece ""Airport Adventure"" collection, and a 2-pack of ""Grem in Trouble/Acer in Trouble"" in the 7-piece ""Ye Left Turn Inn"" collection.Although he's one of the ""bad guys"", I can't help having a personal soft spot for Acer, since I learned to drive in a car just like him - except that it was maroon.  His license plate says ""FSHBWL"", which is hilarious because you certainly did feel like you were driving in a fish bowl, and even though it was considered a ""lemon"" with a terrible track record, I LOVED that car!  (I guess all teens love the car they experienced their independence in for the first time!)  One suggestion:  with the 2015 collections readily available and reasonably priced, we'd suggest going with the ""Grem/Acer in Trouble"" 2-pack if you're just starting out, since Grem isn't offered as part of any of the other collections this year.

"So, do you want the good news or the bad news first?  Let's start with the good (at least as good as it can get with Take-n-Play models from 2014/2015.)  If you're a parent who's only looking to move your child through what you believe will be a brief ""Thomas phase"" (versus seriously collecting), then there are a half dozen ""value"" packs Fisher-Price has come out with that should satisfy that need at a reasonable price (by ""reasonable"", I mean that the MSRPs for the packs are more reflective of the models' actual worth, versus the outrageous $6 MSRP for the small models when sold separately... they USED to be worth that, but are far from it now.)  This ""Sodor Celebration"" 4-pack is in honor of 70 years of Thomas, and includes a specially decorated Thomas, his coaches (Annie & Clarabel), and Sir Topham Hatt's blue car.  The MSRP is $15, so effectively you're paying @ $3.75 for each model.  Here's a list of the other ""value"" packs, so you can compare (you'll notice some character duplications):Lift & Load Cargo Crew 4-pack ($15 MSRP) includes Harvey, Max, Monty and a rail car with removable rubble.  Dieselworks Fix-Up 4-pack ($15 MSRP) includes Diesel, Den, Dart and a cargo car that ""rattles and shakes"".  Brendam Buddies 4-pack ($15 MSRP) includes Percy, Salty, Bulstrode and a blue Troublesome Truck.  Steamies vs. Diesels 6-pack ($20 MSRP, equating to $3.33/each) includes steam engines Thomas, Percy & Charlie and diesel engines Diesel, Iron 'Arry & Iron Bert.  Thomas' Favorite Friends 10-pack ($30 MSRP, equating to $3/each) includes Thomas, Percy, Diesel, Victor, Dash, Kevin, Winston, Harold, Captain and Bertie.  Of these, the 10-pack is your best bet, possibly adding Sodor Celebration (even though Thomas is in both, at least this pack has a specially decorated Thomas, and you'll probably want Thomas' coaches and the guy who runs the railway, Sir Topham Hatt.)Now for the bad news.  If you intend to seriously collect and can afford wooden trains (we couldn't), get them, because Take-n-Play is no longer the amazing line of weighty feeling, exquisitely detailed diecasts and high quality playsets that it was when Fisher-Price took over the diecast line from Learning Curve's ""Take-Along"" in 2010 and re-named it ""Take-n-Play"".  (If you can afford the typically higher asking prices for the no-longer-manufactured Take-Along models combined with older models of Take-n-Play - immediately noticeable by the older models' protruding, squarish magnets versus the round, flat magnets of Take-n-Play's 2014/2015 heavily plasticized, severely detail-stripped models - then by all means go for it, if you don't mind doing some hunting and pecking.  Even ""used"" models, if they're the older ones, have it all over these ""brand new"" so-called ""diecasts"".)  We were completely thrilled with the quality and price/value relationship during the first two years we collected for our oldest grandson (2010/2011), still pretty happy in 2012, but by the end of 2013 we'd witnessed such a quality decline that we stopped collecting at the end of that year (we'd still be collecting for two additional gradsons who've come along, had it not been for the quality issues.)$3/each for the 10 pack?  Not terrible.  $3.75/each for these?  Starting to lose that cost/value relationship.  You work too hard for your dollars to pad Fisher-Price's pockets when they're putting out Take-n-Play products that are in no way, shape or form comparable to models from just a few years ago.  You and your youngster both deserve better, and if you could hold one of the 65th Anniversary Toy Fair Thomas models in one hand, this 70th Anniversary ""Sodor Celebration"" model in the other and compare the two side by side, I think you'd pass on this line altogether.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33721ZYHAWOZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXGTAOK#wasThisHelpful","R33721ZYHAWOZ7","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a tease!  Mattel's 2015 10-piece ""Tokyo Party"" collection has only TWO of the three super tiny but hugely darling 1:55 scale Japanese fan dancers (Okuni and Shigeko) from Cars 2... where's Tamiko?!  Though all of them have been released previously in multi-pack form, this is the first time two of them are being released as singles and, at least to my knowledge, they've never been released all together.  I think a 3-pack would've been amazing!It's going to be SO hard for me to resist adding Okuni to the collection we've been putting together for our three grandsons for going on four years now - just so beautifully detailed with her traditional Kabuki makeup and gorgeous kimono!  And these little models are as durable as they are great to look at.  There's just such a long list of minor characters we want to add this Christmas, and since the ""girl cars"" usually end up in my hands during playtime, I guess I'll just have to be patient for now in favor of some others I think the boys would be more interested in.

"Although they've been released previously in multi-pack form with other characters, Mattel's 2015 10-piece ""Tokyo Party"" collection is the first time two of the three darling (TINY) and amazingly detailed 1:55 scale Japanese fan dancers (Shigeko and Okuni) from Cars 2 are being released as singles!  A bit disappointing to see they're not also releasing the third (Tamiko) as a single right now as well, but I guess Mattel's got that old saying in mind... ""Always leave 'em wanting more!""Modeled as a 2009 Smart ForTwo Passion coupe, Shigeko is adorable in her traditional geisha get-up - look at all of the intricate detail work!  I would SO love to add her to the collection of these terrifically durable diecasts we began collecting for our grandsons over 3-1/2 years ago, but since all of the ""girl cars"" are typically handed right over to me during playtime, and there are SO many other neat minor characters we want to add this year, I guess I'll have to wait  :-(  Aside from Shigeko and Okuni, others in the ""Tokyo Party"" collection are Acer, Holley Shiftwell, Terry Gong, Miles Axlerod with Microphone, Mike Fuse, and a 3-pack of Mater with Allinol Cans/Edamame Tsashimi/Daisu Tsashimi.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUWYR3SGATXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WPAXW#wasThisHelpful","RQUWYR3SGATXP","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a terrific 3-pack this is, stemming from one of THE funniest scenes in Cars 2... during the Tokyo party to welcome all of the World Grand Prix racers, Mater - who doesn't have the opportunity to get to fancy parties much and can't believe all of the free food and beverages! - with his truck bed piled high with free Allinol cans, eyes some extremely hot wasabi at a stand manned by two Sushi chefs (Edamame and Daisu), mistaking it for pistachio ice cream.  Just in case you're a parent/grandparents unfamiliar with the movie, I can't resist filling you in on the hilarious lines from that scene:Mater: ""Hey, what you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream?""Sushi Chef: ""No, no, wasabi.""Mater: ""Oh, same old same old. What's up with you? That looks delicious!""Sushi Chef: (gives a little piece of wasabi)Mater: ""Er...little more, please. It is free, right? Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go. It's free. You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.""Sushi Chef: (gives little by little, then gives a big scoop when Mater said ""Scoop, scoop."")Mater: ""There ya go! Now that's a scoop of ice cream!""Sushi Chef (in Japanese): """" (Okiyami moshia-arimasu, My condolences.)This Mater model is TERRIFIC - loaded up with his free Allinol cans (even his tow hook has hold of one!), along with a facial expression that matches his excitement at all of the freebies.  The Sushi chefs are so very tiny and adorable, with their bandanas and little knives, and with Daisu also holding a little take-out box full of wasabi for Mater (the knives, etc. are flexible plastic, so though you're probably worried they'll break off, but our going on four years of experience collecting these terrific Mattel 1:55 scale Cars/Cars 2 models for our grandsons tells us that won't happen.)  This is the first time that memorable scene is coming out in the Mattel line... back in 2012, we'd actually purchased Disney Store's larger, 1:43 scale models of both Wasabi Mater and the Sushi Shefs (that was before we'd experienced both and then decided to stick with Mattel's smaller and more durable models)... our Mater model does come with sound - he has his tongue sticking out with a piece of wasabi on it, and when the switch on the bottom is turned to the ""on"" position - Mater screams... ""Aughhhhhhhhhhhh!""  BUT, ours doesn't have the Allinol cans, and I guarantee you that Mattel's Sushi Chefs will hold up better than ours (not to mention neither of ours is holding a box of wasabi.)  This is just such a neat packaged set, and they're three of Mattel's 2015 10-piece ""Tokyo Party"" collection, with the others being Shigeko, Acer, Holley Shiftwell, Okuni, Terry Gong, Miles Axlerod with Microphone, and Mike Fuse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R328VPTZ84WNBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4D40J0#wasThisHelpful","R328VPTZ84WNBL","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With four different listings of Mattel's 1:55 scale model of Skipper, it would be very confusing to someone just starting to purchase ""Planes"" diecasts for they're youngster... what's the difference between them all?  That's just it - there isn't any difference, other than the packaging!  This listing shows model #CKF46, the original packaging shows #X9461, the ""Fire & Rescue"" packaging shows #BDB94, and the 2015 packaging shows #DLK98 with a ""Propwash Junction"" motif - ALL the same plane, so shop around for your best price!An old Navy F4U Corsair and former flying ace, Skipper Riley was a recluse until he met Dusty Crophopper and became his mentor.  He's based on the real-life WWII VF-17 squadron known as ""The Jolly Rangers"", and in the movie, he was the instructor of the elite Jolly WRENCHES fighter jets (very clever!)  He's a handsome shade of blue with white, sporting the Jolly Wrenches insignia and the number ""7"", along with ""VF-17"" on the rear of his fuselage.  He re-appeared in the sequel.This Skipper model measures @ 3-3/4""L with a wing span of 4-3/4"", and stands 1-5/8""H (not including the additional 1/2"" his propeller extends.)  These smaller Mattel models (as opposed to Disney Store's larger, heavier 1:43 scale models) have been our choice in building a collection for our grandsons (ages 7, 3 & 1).  Disney Store models are always beautifully detailed, but their heavier metal concentration also makes them more brittle and prone to pieces breaking off.  We've been watching ""Planes"" races put on by our grandsons for 2 years now, and despite how aggressive the racing can get during these air shows, we've yet to have a propeller, wheel or anything else pop off.  We're confident all of these diecasts will still be in great shape to take out of the attic when our great-grands arrive one day!  Other models being released with the ""Propwash Junction"" motif are Strut Jetstream Dusty (formerly released in a boxed set under the name ""Qualifying Dusty""), Chug, Leadbottom, and Mayday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X20U9XF7475Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4D3KCS#wasThisHelpful","R2X20U9XF7475Y","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While becoming ""Cars"" and ""Planes"" fans right along with our grandsons, part of what my husband and I have really enjoyed has been the casting of the voice actors in the movies - can't see this diecast of Harvey without hearing Jerry Stiller's voice!  In ""Planes Fire & Rescue"", the name ""Harvey"" is a tongue-in-cheek play on words for ""RV"" (Harvey... RV), and he's the former RV tire store manager who comes to Piston Peak National Park to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary with his former showroom model bride, Winnie (a Winnebago, of course, voiced by - who else? - his real life wife, Anne Meara, part of that great old comedy duo my husband and I fondly recalled from our younger days!)  So ironic that Stiller and Meara were, in actuality, celebrating their own 60th anniversary in 2014 when the movie came out, and so sad than Meara would pass away this year.There are a couple of different listings for Harvey - this one shows model #CDT87, and another shows #DLT07 with a ""Piston Peak"" motif on the packaging - same Harvey, so shop for the best price.  It'll be nice to add these diecasts to our grandsons' ""Planes"" collection, which has grown to 40 characters over the past couple of years!  We're very big fans of Mattel's 1:55 scale models, and Harvey is one of the larger models (though not as large enough to be considered ""deluxe""), very nicely detailed (don't you love the glasses framing the windshields?) and with a solid, weighty feel to him.  We've had such a great experience with both the ""Planes"" and ""Cars"" 1:55 scale models - so highly durable, and although we were originally a bit concerned about the plastic pieces like sideview mirrors, wheels and propellers breaking off, they're so well-constructed that they're surviving our 3 year old grandson who's a LOT rougher on toys than his 7 year old brother.  That's a good thing, because our 1 year old grandson will want his turn with them too, and we have every intention of boxing these guys (& gals) up for our great-grandkids to enjoy!The ONE thing that annoys us is that we heard Winnie might not be made available as a single, but rather make her debut as part of a boxed set.  On the backer, it shows Winnie as part of the ""Piston Peak"" motif series (along with Harvey, Linus Lines, Secretary of the Interior - otherwise known as Teddy - Tractor Buck, Trudy Trailway, RacER Dusty - as opposed to RacING Dusty in the WATG Racers series - and a re-release of Ol' Jammer are part of the motif as well), and says ""each sold separately"", so hopefully that rumor is false since - unfortunately - those boxes sets usually include characters already in our collection, so oftentimes we can't take advantage of them and have to buy a ""loose"" model.  Sure do wish they would've included Harvey and Winnie together as a duo... we realize Mattel's strategy has occasionally been to include otherwise unattainable new models in boxed sets to drive sales, but it's frustrating to long term collectors.  (Not to mention - how can they justify separating Stiller & Meara?!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R52P1DC6L8E4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCAJNP0#wasThisHelpful","R52P1DC6L8E4A","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were three ""singles"" versions of main character Dusty Crophopper stemming from the original ""Planes"" movie (Racing Dusty, Supercharged Dusty, Jolly Wrenches Dusty) in Mattel's 1:55 scale diecast line in 2013, adding a couple of new ones in 2014 stemming from its sequel ""Fire & Rescue"" (Pontoon Dusty, Firefighter Dusty) while re-releasing Supercharged Dusty with a ""Fire & Rescue"" backer card.  There was just one other version during that period - never sold as a single, only in a ToysRUs exclusive boxed set called ""North Atlantic Sprint"" - named ""Qualifying Dusty"".  This is THAT Dusty, finally being released as a single, just re-naming it ""Strut Jetstream Dusty"" (the moniker Dusty chose for the qualifying race to enter the Wings Around the Globe Rally.)  We didn't purchase that set for our grandson's extensive collection of Mattel diecasts from the two movies, since we'd already purchased all of the other characters in the set (and didn't want to hand over our first born child to purchase a ""loose"" model!)  There are a couple of different listings for Strut Jetstream Dusty - this one has model #CKF42, while the other is #DLL85 and shows a ""Propwash Junction"" motif on the packaging - same plane.We were excited to see the ""single"" version, which is part of the ""Propwash Junction"" motif (Mattel has gone to new backers this year on all of their ""Planes"" products, giving each one a themed motif - both neat NEW models and re-releases are included, so if you've already been collecting for a couple of years as we have, you want to be careful not to pick up a re-release just because of the new backer.  Others with the ""Propwash Junction"" motif we know of so far are re-releases of Chug, Leadbottom, Mayday and Skipper.)  But we REALLY got excited since hearing about a boxed set they're coming out with that not only has this Dusty model we were never able to add, but also FIVE OTHER BRAND NEW models - that's a rarity.  The others to be included are Fonzarelli #8, Piston #12, Firebird #16, Hammer #17 and Jackson #18, so if your youngster is asking for ""Strut Jetstream"", you might want to keep that in mind!  They've actually come out with yet ANOTHER Dusty model called ""RacER Dusty"", included in the Piston Peak motif series, as opposed to a re-release of ""RacING Dusty"", included in the WATG Racers motif series... DUSTYS EVERYWHERE!We're head over heels in love with the durability of these Mattel models - they're already surviving our first two grandsons (7 & 3), with a 1 year old who's patiently waiting for his turn.  Had some experience with the larger (1:43 scale) Disney Store models too, and while they're really beautiful and heavier, they're also more brittle - the majority of our investment has been on the Mattel models, and couldn't be happier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBMTC1JGA4DH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4D3KKA#wasThisHelpful","RBBMTC1JGA4DH","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mattel's version of Yellow Bird is really a handsome looking American plane, modeled after an Extra EA-300 (we're learning all about aircraft models while reading up on these ""Planes"" characters!),  with his striking yellow color contrasting with the black checkered pattern on his sides and tip of his right wing, and his racing number (17) on the other wing and his tail.  We started a collection of the 1:55 scale Mattel models for our older grandson (now 7-1/2) a couple of years ago, and my husband and I have enjoyed being in the audience during innumerable races!  There are a couple of listings for Yellowbird - same plane, so choose the one with the best price.  He's included in a Target 4 pack called ""Take to the Skies"".We've experienced both Mattel's 1:55 scale and Disney Store's 1:43 scale items from his ""Cars 2"" collection, deciding to go with the Mattel models when we started on the ""Planes"" collection.  Although Disney Store's are super neat (not only larger, but also definitely a much heavier metal concentration than Mattel's, which feel more like a very strong plastic to us), it was annoying to have to keep super-gluing back on pieces of the Disney Store models - just an accidental drop to the floor, and off would pop a spoiler or something else, let alone the on-purpose crashes that happen during races!

We've been collecting Mattel's 1:55 scale diecasts stemming from the original ""Planes"" movie and its sequel (""Fire & Rescue"") since 2013 - our grandsons thoroughly enjoy playing with them, we love their durability, but just one suggestion if you're just starting out... there are MANY boxed sets, with MANY character duplicates, so sort through them all and develop some sort of game plan prior to purchasing!

"You'll see quite a few listings for Mattel's 1:55 scale Bravo model (this one shows model #CDR41, another shows #X9462, and still another shows #DLL90 with a ""U.S.S. Flysenhower motif on the packaging - they're all the same plane.  Mattel's gone to a motif-themed packaging design in 2015 for their ""Planes"" models this year - while there are some cool looking new releases under this motif (Delta, Falco, Jigsaw #29, Roybal, and Lucas #36 models), there a few re-releases too - this Bravo, along with Echo and Jolly Wrenches Dusty.  I suggest checking out the various listings and purchasing whichever is most reasonably priced.Bravo is one of the Navy's ""Jolly Wrenches"" top fighter troops (along with Echo, and now Delta), who helps keep the skies safe during the Wings Around the Globe Rally.  They're based on Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornets, and while there are various design elements that distinguish them, the most immediately recognizable is that Bravo's helmet is silver, Echo's helmet is red, and Delta's is yellow (if you take a super close look, they also have their names on their helmets).  They're all gray & black with bits of yellow on their tails, and have the Jolly Wrenches insigtnia in several places, but another distinguishing element on Bravo is his number - ""113"" on both sides of his nose, and a little ""13"" under the yellow/black checkered stripe on his tail.  They (along with two new U.S.S,Flysenhower additions Falco, a helicopter, and Skipper look-alike Jigsaw #29) have a special affinity for Dusty Crophopper, the underdog main character of the movie, who ends up adopting the Jolly Wrenches insignia in the Jolly Wrenches version of Dusty.In terms of actual measurements for Bravo, ""1:55 scale"" equates to @ 4-3/4"" from nose to tail, has a wing span of just under 3-3/4"", and stands 1-7/8""H at the top of his tail fins.  We were hoping to get Jolly Wrenches Dusty, Bravo & Echo as part of a Target 4 pack a couple of years ago called ""Jolly Wrenches"", which included Hector Vector (a Mexican Coast Guard helicopter), but couldn't find it anywhere.  We ended up having to purchase the first three separately, and were disappointed to discover that Hector Vector apparently hadn't even been released singularly (still hasn't, as of this writing.)  There's a Disney Store version, but our experience with Disney Store items is that while they're bigger - 1:43 scale as compared to Mattel's 1:55 scale - and definitely constructed with a higher metal concentration than the Mattel versions which feel more like a sturdy plastic, they're not as durable in our opinion... we had to keep super-gluing pieces of the Disney Store versions that broke off.  Racing can get pretty aggressive in the hands of a 5 - now 7 - year old, especially with a 3 year old brother now playing (roughly!) with them, and a 1 year old brother who'd just love to grab hold of one as his latest teething toy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCC2Q23OPHWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4D3SNO#wasThisHelpful","R1VCC2Q23OPHWL","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original ""Planes"" movie and its sequel (""Fire & Rescue"") has already netted us 40 of these Mattel 1:55 scale diecast characters - our grandsons get such a kick out of playing with them, and my husband and I have been treated to numerous air shows and daring acts of bravery!  One of the characters we'd really wanted (a Mexican Coast Guard helicopter named Hector Vector) was only available through a Target multi-pack called ""Jolly Wrenches"", but we already had the other characters in the boxed set and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a ""loose"" model.  We're so happy to see another one named Falco being introduced!There are a couple of listings for Falco - this one has model #CKF50, while the other is #DLL05 and shows the ""U.S.S. Flysenhower"" motif on the packaging - same helicopter.  These ""regular"" singles are smaller than Mattel's ""deluxe"" helicopter models (Blade Ranger & Windlifter, and 2015's new ""Blazin' Blade Ranger"")... a few inches less in length (@ 4-3/4"") and not as tall.  But I think this is definitely one we'll be adding to the collection this Christmas, having been SO pleased with the quality and durability of the models we've collected over the past several years (from both of the ""Cars"" as well as both of the ""Planes"" movies).  If you're thinking (as we had), ""Oh... those propellers will pop off in a heartbeat..."", our experience has been the exact opposite, happy to say!  A couple of years into heavy duty racing of the ""Planes"" models - by both our 7 year old and 3 year old grandsons - and nary a prop or wheel has broken.  Considering the punishment the 3 year old is prone to inflicting on toys, that's saying a lot!  We've got a 1 year old grandson as well, and there's no doubt in our minds that not only will he be able to have a turn with them, but they'll still be in great shape to box up for visits (hopefully!) from great-grandkids one day down the line.A number of themed motifs are being introduced by Mattel in 2015 to extend the life of its diecasts from both the original ""Planes"" movie and its sequel (""Fire & Rescue"") - while there are several re-releases among them, the ""U.S.S.

"I know this sharp looking two-tone blue Jackson Riles plane will be a favorite of our oldest grandson, since blue is one of his favorite colors!  If you've got a youngster who's a ""Planes"" fanatic and you happen to be a parents or grandparent who hasn't yet seen the original movie (or need a refresher),  Jackson's in the same position as main character Dusty Crophopper, a plane with a lot of passion who's making his first attempt to qualify for the international ""Wings Around the Globe Rally"" at ""Nebraska Trials"" (the motif that appears in the corner of the packaging.)  Only the top 5 qualifiers would go on to compete... unfortunately, poor Jackson hit one of the gates and didn't make it in!  (Though main character Dusty Crophopper originally placed 6th, he was bumped up a notch after Fonzarelli - who'd placed 5th - was discovered to be using an illegal fuel and was disqualified.)Heard about a very nice boxed set they're coming out with that contains not only Jackson, but four other BRAND NEW MODELS (Fonzarelli #8, Piston #12, Firebird #16, and Hammer #17) - which doesn't happen often (usually the boxed sets contain a re-release of at least one or more characters already in our grandson's collection) - along with the one Dusty model we were never able to add (Qualifying Dusty, which is now being referred to as Strut Jetstream Dusty - first time he's available as a single, and it'll be a bonus to have him included in a boxed set!)  If you're considering a Jackson purchase, it's something to keep in mind - think we'll hold off on a Jackson purchase until then.The other planes we've heard about coming in under the ""Nebraska Trials"" motif (at least so far, if you have any interest in collecting) are Secord #4, Fonzarelli, Tysonitis #9, Pack Rat #10, Piston, Firebird #14, and Hammer.  We swear by these very durable Mattel 1:55 scale models, having collected both the ""Cars"" movies versions and now the ""Planes"" - all still intact after ruthless racing and flying by both a 7 year old and 3 year old grandson, with a 1 year old grandson now awaiting his turn (though I'm sure he'd like to try munching on them right now!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMBE6LPAPZWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013D52DW6#wasThisHelpful","R1GMBE6LPAPZWX","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm usually more excited about it than our grandson when Mattel adds a new one for the 1:55 scale diecast collection we started for him years ago, since I'm always offered to ""be"" the girls during our races (to say there isn't an overabundance of female characters in either Disney's ""Cars"" or ""Planes"" movies would be putting it mildly!)  Pack Rat (although a very minor character who had no speaking lines) reminds me somewhat of Rochelle with her color scheme - they both look like flying valentines with there red/pink/white!  But what's really neat about Pack Rat is that her pink coloring is sort of metallic looking - very neat!There are a couple of listings for Pack Rat - this one has model #CKF54, while the other is #DLK96 with a ""Nebraska Trials"" motif on the packaging - exact same plane.  In case you're unfamiliar with the ""Planes"" movie, the motif in the ""Nebraska Trials"" was the qualifying race in Lincoln Nebraska that all of the ""wannabe's"" had to complete in, with the top five moving on to the prestigious Wings Around the Globe Rally.  Unfortunately, Pack Rat wasn't one of the qualifiers, but it's great to see some of the gorgeous looking planes who DIDN'T qualify now coming out as diecasts too (I've always rooted for underdogs!)  Others in this motif series we've heard of so far are Secord #4, Fonzarelli #8, Tysonitis #9, Piston #12, Firebird #14 (another female... YES!), Gordon #15, Hammer #17, and Jackson #18.We're probably some of the biggest fans of Mattel's smaller scale line, which our experience has shown us have the tendency to hold up a bit better than the larger (1:43 scale), heavier (and more brittle) Disney Store models when it comes to the aggressive racing tactics employed in our basement family room during all of the multiple airshows we've witnessed over the past couple of years!  After all of this time (and a collection that already stands at 40 characters!), I haven't swept up a single broken propeller, wheel, etc, and seems super glue was no longer on our shopping list once we stuck with the Mattel models.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SV1JBR2EZ3E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4D3KN2#wasThisHelpful","R3SV1JBR2EZ3E5","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mattel's gone to themed ""motif"" packaging in 2015 for its ""Planes"" 1:55 scale diecast models, and the ""RSN Racing Sports Network"" motif includes Vasquez (a Mexican helicopter painted in the green/white/red color scheme of the Mexican flag), along with another chopper named Roscoe and Colin Cowling, a blimp (Vasquez, however, has ""RTV - Racing Television"" printed on him rather than RSN.)Like previously released Mexican Coast Guard helicopter Hector Vector (whom we missed out on, since he came only as part of a ""Jolly Wrenches"" boxed set and we already had the other characters included in it), these helicopters - along with a new Navy chopper named Falco - are smaller than Mattel's ""deluxe"" helicopter models stemming from the sequel, ""Fire & Rescue"" (Blade Ranger & Windlifter, and 2015's new ""Blazin' Blade Ranger"")... a few inches less in length (only a bit more than 4"") and not as tall.  But having been extremely pleased with the quality and durability of the Mattel models we've collected over the past several years (from both of the ""Cars"" as well as both of the ""Planes"" movies), we'll more than likely be adding these new guys to the Planes collection we began for our grandsons in 2013 when Christmas rolls around.  I remember thinking back then that the propellers would never survive our middle grandson, but am quite happy to say that hasn't been the case!Especially as compared to a larger (1:43 scale) ""Team Lightning"" helicopter we'd purchased from Disney Store years ago... my gosh, the landing gear was broken off of that model SO quickly - it was sharp to look at, just so much more brittle.  But a Mattel ""Dinoco Helicopter"" we'd purchased around the same time has been ""through the wringer"" with our grandsons, and is still holding up terrifically!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHJUADZMISVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUVN8Z4#wasThisHelpful","RSHJUADZMISVN","A1RKCT4H3X3J1W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RKCT4H3X3J1W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a set of Tweezermen tools that I had for years  - a very expensive set. At the time I complained about the price... but here I am 15+ years late and just now deciding I might like a new set....  This set is a very nice, quality set. The instruments are sharp and solid... not cheapy or ""tinny"" feeling... Have to admit I have no idea or use for the pokey sticks... but they are also sturdy and heavy.  I think the scissors are ""nose hair"" trimmers as they are rounded at the ends... don't need those either, but they too are a nice quality.

The outside is NOT at all ""soft"" as reported by another reviewer... at least mine is not.  It is textured and hard. It is ""matte"" finished, sort of leather ""like.""  The inside is a plastic-like material, no way to really see if the outside is leather or just a textured plastic itself.  It does fit, all the slots and holes are accurate. I have a sparkle/clear outer case (purchased at the Sprint store when I got the phone) that I use over the whole backside that provides a rubber bumper that covers the edges completely and then the outer plastic cover also provides a ""lip"" that protects the glass if the phone is dropped.  The pink shows through nicely, tho it is a very light pink. I think the photo is fairly close to reality (at least to the one I received). In my opinion, you'll be paying $70 for a back that is worth about $5 and that is being very generous.  Honestly, I would pass unless you just really want the ""look"" they advertise on TV all the time.  However reviews are ALL subjective and personal.  Everyone should make choices and decide for themselves. I will update with any wear or other issues. I hope this has helped in some way even if you don't agree. Please let me know if there is any other info that would be helpful to you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNNCD42NG1N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BBVJR4#wasThisHelpful","R1CNNCD42NG1N7","A14B4MJ7KZE63B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14B4MJ7KZE63B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for when I am kayaking.  I a LG G4, so it's bigger. I checked it with some water in the sink... no bubbles.  However, if you think you will be using your phone through the bag... it doesn't work. I had a waterproof bag that DID work... but when I upgraded to a larger phone, of course I couldn't use it anymore as it didn't fit.  Opening it while you are kayaking is risky.  Mostly because the ""bag"" is a silicone type material it ""sticks"" to your phone and other plastic objects making it a tricky process from a kayak while you are balancing and yanking on your phone to get it out. This also risks the seams of the bag too.  Hmmm.  I am keeping the bag for use when I just can't leave it safely at home.  While a quart size ziplock bag isn't ""cool"" it's still the best, most economical choice for me.

"I need a coin purse in my car to throw the loose change that floats around and I like to keep a couple of dollar bills in a separate part for when I need a quick ""tip"" somewhere OR I just need a snack.  :)  This coin purse is about 3 to 3 1/2"" by about 3"" (eyeballing it because I can't find my ruler at this moment) and a bit larger than I had expected.  I liked that.  It's a lovely slate gray... a cloth material... two zippered areas... the main portion and then a side slot (where I keep my dollars).

"This purse is nearly an exact replica of my favorite I've had for about 15 years. As my old one has aged I keep saying, I just need a couple more inches all the way around and this bag would be perfect.  (Ha - that's what she said - I know)... My old bag looked like a huge balloon ready to pop after I have everything I need in it - I've reduced as much as I can.... It says that it is genuine leather and removable tags on the bag also say this.  The texture is very smooth... To be honest, it doesn't really feel like real leather... but who knows? The texture is so perfect, not usually the case with  leather - there is always a flaw somewhere... on the flip side, perhaps this is just a really fine quality. I am hoping that it is real and will become as supple as my old bag with some wear and use. The stitching seems really good.  I also hated the skinny strap of my old bag... the new bag has a lovely strap that is about an 1"" in width... for me, just right - and so much more comfortable.... but everyone has a personal preference.  I like that I can shoulder it or crossover, which I do when I need my hands free - doesn't bother my back as much as just shouldering it. There is plenty of adjustment on the strap for the hang length as well... I am about 5'8"" and there was spare length at about low belly/high hip. When you open the flap there are a couple of magnetic envelope pouches, the largest fits my new LG G4 perfectly, three slots and a zippered area.  In the main body of the bag there are two zippered organizers and a couple of side slots, that would hold a very small cell phone, keys fobs or other things you want to reach quick - too short for reading glasses, though... The bag itself isn't terribly heavy which is good. When I ""load"" it with everything I need it's still reasonably weighted... 3-5 lbs (?) It came with a storage/dust bag, a nice touch, although it will probably not spend much time in it. It arrived quickly (I have prime) along with some other things I had ordered.  I will be updating  with any wear or other issues as necessary.  I will try to include some pics if they get past the censors and they include my old bag for reference as well as a 12"" ruler for comparison.8/27/2015... I have been using this bag exclusively for a few weeks.  It's STILL my fav.  I should also add that if you wanted to you could slide in a kindle or an IPAD if you wanted to. I have the larger Kindle and when I am going somewhere I know I will be waiting, I slide it in.  I am seriously considering buying a second one to have a backup when this one gives out, hopefully years from now.  :)  Could go with a different color... but honestly I usually buy the black as it goes with everything, all year.  But that's just me. I did get a like smudge of something grayish/white.  I used a little leather cleaner and wiped it off, a very slight amount of black come off too, but didn't leave any noticeable trace.  So I am ok with that.  It has NOT left any color on my clothing.  And I have been in damp area with rain/mist and/or sweaty humidity - so... I think that is good.  I will continue to update with any issues or other thoughts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6OOTL5ZCIPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6PGH5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3R6OOTL5ZCIPL","A14B4MJ7KZE63B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14B4MJ7KZE63B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several old eagle creek travel shoe bags (5+ ? years old) and I was so excited to get some additional bags!  As is often the case with ""new"" versions, there have been some changes... sadly the new ones (these) seem to be thinner, less durable material, feels less rubbery to me than the older version.... and the handles are thinner, more narrow, less heavy duty braid as well.  We'll see. I love this style and will use them. Initially I thought they were a tad smaller, but when I flattened them out and compared with an old style, they may be slightly smaller, but not really enough to notice.  There is enough room for one pair of larger style shoes (big heels/wedges) or three or four pairs of flipflops or maybe two pairs of flats with shoe tops...depending on the size of your shoe (mine are generally 8 to 9) There is a zipper, which, again, seems less durable but I remain hopeful. I like that my shoe bottoms don't touch my clothes as I am traveling. And with the zipper, the shoes stay in the bag as opposed to drawstring style.  If color is important to you, they are a darkish gray, zipper and handle is black.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great condition with some other items I ordered.

"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while, I was pleased to receive this A261 Dash Camera in return for an independent and unbiased review.  Pleased to say its excellent.Please Note:  Unusually, there are two different Dash Camera products for sale on the same page.  This is a review of the A261 - the small slightly square looking device, not the longer horizontal device.What is it?--------------A tiny little device that sits attached to the windscreen to record your journey, and (in the unfortunate event of an accident), record what happened in fantastic high quality HD (1920x1080) video.  It was recently reported in the news, that in the UK video footage is now being accepted by insurance companies as evidence in the event of an accident - so a useful device.Whats it like---------------Measuring just under 3 tall by 2.5 wide and an inch deep, its the the smallest dash camera Ive reviewed, but its still a pretty neatly designed device, and weights only 96g (to put this in context an iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy is 133g).  It will record in full HD (1080p) or 720p although youll need a large Micro-SD card to fit a lot of recording on it with about 130Mb a minute for full 1080p footage.It also has a built in GPS to record your exact location and speed (which may be critical evidence in the event of an accident which was not your fault).In terms of design, it has a 2 inch (diameter) rear LCD screen to show whats being recorded, and 4 buttons to cycle through the numerous menus.  Pleased to say the buttons are nicely placed at the base of the screen making it easy to navigate when the device is fitted to the car.The device comes with a small and quite nicely designed 2.5 diameter suction cup to secure it to the windscreen.  A small plastic catch is used to secure the camera to the suction cup which is handy as its easy to detatch and remove it if you leave the vehicle for a while.  It also comes with a hugely long (3.5m) power cable and a cigarette lighter adapter which is a great bonus.  Sounds daft, but it means you can replace the adapter with a two USB socket device meaning you can power your smartphone and camera at the same time.  (Ive also reviewed a product from a household name where the cable was fixed to the adapter, making it useless if you have two or more devices in the car).Finally, you also get a short USB to Micro-USB cable (nice touch, means you can download video to your computer without removing the cable from the car), and what appears to be a comprehensive instruction manual - which unfortunately turns out to only have 10 pages - and lots of languages.  Still - it was pretty easy to operate.In terms of set-up and use, the 2 inch although it was a pity the battery on mine was flat when it arrived (although that may be just because it was a review item).  All settings seemed fairly logical, and it was pretty easy to fix to the windscreen with an extra long cable which was very useful as it means you can hide it discretely out of the way.  Oddly enoughIt didnt come with any CD or software - but Ive found most of this to be pretty usefulness anyway - so no loss there.In everyday use I found it a breeze to use.  Recorded image quality was excellent, (both day and night), and its nice to see this will take a micro-USB card up to 64 Gb (not the usual 32Gb of most devices).  I found the LCD screen a little small, but once Id set it up, I didnt bother to look at it again, and it was nice to see it automatically powered on when I turned the ignition.Overall, a nicely designed device.  Aside from lane detection system (which warns you if youre drifting out of your lane), it doesnt have lots of useless features and toys which I personally find great to play with initially - then completely ignore.Overall - gets a thumbs up from me.Whats good about it?--------------------------* Video quality is excellent both during the day and night - it was easy to identify the all important licence plates of other vehicles* Built in rechargeable battery - means you can use it away from the car if needed* Easy to access and use buttons - seriously - this is important - some of these devices are a pain to operate* Extra long cable with a USB plug at the end, plus a separate cigarette lighter adapter - great as you can replace the adapter, and the long cable is a bonusWhat's not so good?----------------------------* The instruction manual was a little brief - but I admit it passed the bloke test - could I get it working without instructions.* Its a pity the charger is not a dual USB - which would mean you could charge your smartphone at the same time - but these are cheap on Amazon* Doesnt come with a Micro-SD card - but these things never do.  I bought a 16g Micro-SD from Amazon for about 5/$5.Conclusion---------------Smashing dash cam - works a treat","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPS52IED3GY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5IH2X2#wasThisHelpful","RRPS52IED3GY9","A1TUL3FFHYEXBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUL3FFHYEXBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while, I was pleased to be offered this desktop charger in return for an independent and unbiased review.Measuring just 6 x 2.5 by 1 thick and weighing only 192g (slightly more than an iPhone 6 at 133g), its a surprisingly dinky charging device, and would make a great travel charger, or to keep the entire family powered from a single socket at home.It comes complete with a standard plug and power cable with a figure of 8 socket which plugs into the rear, with a sequence of six USB sockets on the top - each placed with a half inch gap between them, so theres plenty of space for all your mobile devices to charge at the same time.  This is handy to know, as it means you can plug in a European plug and cable - provided it has a figure of 8 connection which is a common socket on electrical devices.In terms of design, its nicely made, sollid build quality and very small.  Again to put this in context, Ive reviewed another charger which had a separate external wall charger which was bigger than this entire device.  It also has a subtle blue power light which comes on when you plug it in so you know its powered on at the wall.  So full marks for design.In terms of functionality,  you can plug in up to six separate USB plugs to charge anything from a Kindle, eCigarette, iPhones, iPads or Android tablets, and they each draw as much (or as little) power as needed.  Again this is a nice design feature, as Ive seen other devices which have separate sockets for tablet computers (which draw lots of power) or smartphones (which draw less).  In total you get 50 watts (evenly distributed with 10A) of power, and it certainly worked well for me with an iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, iPad 3 a Kindle and iPhone 5S all charging at the same time.The real killer feature of this device however (and so obvious Im amazed nobody else has managed to implement this already), is the USB sockets are reversible.  A tiny feature - but its really irritating to find yourself plugging and un-plugging USB devices as they only fit one way.With this device, you plug in a USB any way - it works correctly every time.In summary, a tiny desk top charger, small enough to take travelling but with enough power for six devices at once.Gets my thumbs up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2L2V3AAILT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZIB0D1W#wasThisHelpful","RI2L2V3AAILT2","A1TUL3FFHYEXBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUL3FFHYEXBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while I was pleased to receive these bluetooth headphones in return for an independent and unbiased review.Open up the quite smart packaging to reveal a really quite impressive pair of light weight comfortable headphones with quite impressive sound quality for the price.  Build quality is great, and theyre as cool in real life as in the photos with a piano black glossy band over the head, and silver plastics with steel headband extenders for additional strength and durability.Overall look and feel is one of quality, and the ear cushions (although a little small for my ears), are soft and comfortable - even when wearing these for several hours.  Its also nice to see they fold away for storage, although they dont come with a carry case which is a pity.In addition to the headphones, you get a short 6 page instruction guide, and a micro-USB cable (to charge them) along with a standard 3.5mm Aux cable if you prefer to be wired.  I was disappointed to find mine flat straight out of the box, so left them plugged in for a couple of hours to charge up, after which I found they ran for what must have been nearly 24 hours over the coming week.  As with nearly all these devices you dont get a charger, but you can charge them from a standard USB port on a computer or use a smartphone charger.Once fully charged, press the power button on the right earpiece to power them on, and theres a volume up/down button which also serves to switch tracks.In terms of use, the sound quality is really quite impressive at this price point - theyre certainly punching above their weight.  While Im no audiophile, so I cant comment on the treble response or mid-range highs - theyre clearly stand out terrific.While writing this review, Ive listened to a series of test tracks including, the solid bass beats of Radioheads High and Dry, and the haunting deep echoey lyrics of Exit music (for a film) - used in Baz Luhrman's version of ""Romeo & Juliet"" - great film.  Bill Withers - Aint no Sunshine - just sounds wonderfully smooth.  While the punchy rock in Should I stay or Should I Go (The Clash) just sounds terrific (always a good test track), and finally the punchy bass beats of Blue Monday (New Order) is just wonderful!Even on soft quiet tracks like Hollow Ponds by Damon Albarn, (ex lead singer of Blur and Gorillaz), sounds wonderful.  You can hear his fingers moving up and down the acoustic guitar, and the haunting backing sound of children playing.  The separation (the fact you can identify and listen to individual instruments), is just wonderful.Overall, Im pretty impressed by these.  If they were just a wired pair of headphones Id be pleased.

"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while I was pleased to receive these bluetooth headphones in return for an independent and unbiased review.Open up the quite smart packaging to reveal a really quite impressive pair of light weight comfortable headphones with quite impressive sound quality for the price.  Build quality is great, and theyre as cool in real life as in the photos with a piano black glossy band over the head, and silver plastics with steel headband extenders for additional strength and durability.Overall look and feel is one of quality, and the ear cushions (although a little small for my ears), are soft and comfortable - even when wearing these for several hours.

"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while I was pleased to receive these digital bathroom scales in return for an independent and unbiased review.Having used these for a month now, I can honestly report they work a treat.  At 13.5 square, you get a huge area to stand on, with a large 3 x 1.25 bright blue LED display that even if youre short-sighted like me its easy to see.The main plate is covered in a thick (5mm) glass cover which is both hygienic and easy to wipe clean, and the device itself is nicely thin at just 1.25 which means its easy to stow away if youre bathroom is not large enough to leave it lying around.  At 2.1Kg in weight, its also light enough to lift and carry about, but certainly feels good quality and well built.In terms of functionality, it comes with 4 AAA batteries which are easily installed, and displays your weight in old money (Pounds) or new money (Kilograms).  Its a pity it doesnt show your weight in Stones and Pounds (that Im more used to), but I quickly adapted to comparing weight in Kilograms.  I did compare the accuracy to my previous (very expensive, very heavy) scales, and can confirm these are also very accurate.Of course the USP (Unique Selling Point) of this device is it uses a bluetooth connection to pair with your phone, and you can record, and track your weight directly into the iChoice App.  I have to admit, while initially I was quite pleased by the idea, Im not convinced it works very well.  Firstly, I seldom take my smartphone into the bathroom with me, (expensive electronics and water dont work together very well), and while it does quickly connect via bluetooth, I found the app rather over-complex, and yet another place to store information.Personally, I just ignore the bluetooth aspect, and record the information in the Apple Health App - Im sure if youve a fitness tracking device youll be able to store your weight in that as well.So, as a bathroom scales I found it terrific.  A large easy to clean surface area, a huge bright display, but narrow and only 2Kg (so easy to stow away), its a hit in our house.  Have to say the App was less useful, but thats just my opinion.  As a set of scales theyre great.Highly Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GB8182CC5GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCF9GS0#wasThisHelpful","R32GB8182CC5GJ","A1TUL3FFHYEXBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUL3FFHYEXBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while, I was pleased to be receive this tablet computer for free in return for an independent assessment.  Ill concentrate less on the technical jargon and numbers and more on the experience.  After all, it doesnt matter if it has a Quad Core 32 bit processor with 8 gigabytes of storage if it doesnt work very well.Before I start, lets put this in context.  For the price of a Nexus 7 or iPad mini, you could buy several of these tablets, and still have enough money left for a massive 32Gb SD card.  Youre looking at the value end of the spectrum, but the real question - is it any good?While you could compare devices based purely by specification  (eg. 16Gb of storage is double the 8Gb size), its often quite a subjective area.  For example, how do you assess sound quality produced from a tablet computer.  Ive therefore given this device a percentage score in a series of categories.* 100% means I think its just fantastic. The best you can buy.  For example an iPad Air 2 (costing ten times the price) would for example get 100% for design and build quality.* 50% means I think its great - about average.So here goes.*** Overall Design ***  80% ***Clearly this is aimed as a first tablet computer for a child, and thats reflected in the child friendly packaging.  Opening it up, youll find a standard sized 7 tablet computer, a thick rubber case to protect it, and a wall transformer and micro-USB cable to charge the device.  It also comes with a short user guide which is surprisingly good, including photos and screen shots to illustrate the basics on how to get to going.Clearly this device gets bonus points for the thick foam case which gives lots of protection.  Its light and small enough for little hands, and has survived some heavy handed use by my 3 year old granddaughter.*** Screen ***  60% ***As with most budget tablets, the screen is plastic rather than the Gorilla Glass of the Nexus, and theres noticeable screen reflection  - so you wont be able to use this in bright sun-light - but thats not uncommon.  While the 1024 x 600 screen resolution was acceptable, colours were decidedly muted, even with the brightness turned up to maximum which is likely to drain the battery.  I also found there was a significant lag (often up to 2 seconds) when the device was switched from portrait to landscape mode which I personally found irritating, and Im sure a child would quickly tire of.*** Sound Quality *** 40% ***Sound quality wasnt brilliant (again as youd expect at this price), and unfortunately it doesnt come with a bluetooth connection.  This is a major issue for me, as I often listen to music on these devices connected to a bluetooth speaker.  It also means you cant connect a bluetooth keyboard, or in fact any wireless device.  Youre limited to using a pair of wired headphones (none-supplied), and sound quality was OK but way too quiet to listen to anything in a noisy environment.*** Cameras *** 40% ***As youd expect theres a front and rear facing camera (although details were not provided), so you can take snaps or video, or use it for Skype.  Again, quality was not brilliant, and in fact colours were really muted - almost sepia in colour despite being shot in bright sun-light.  Video likewise was very poor quality even outdoors.*** Web Browsing *** 40% ***I quickly connected it to Google and my photos, eMail and address book were immediately available.  I then tested it on a few web pages including the image rich Daily Mail web site.  While its unlikely your child will watch this web site, its an excellent test of the processor speed on whats a fairly basic function - navigating web pages.  Sorry to say, that while it scrolled up and down the screen pretty quickly there was a an awful delay in zooming into or out of web pages which is a real pity.  I tried it on a few YouTube screens, and video played OK, although again, the delay between selecting a video and it playing was irritating, and sound very quiet.*** Game Playing *** 40% ***While I wouldnt expect a device at this price point to run the most expensive, complex games, I do have one favourite Air Wings which has some basic 3D graphics, and runs on everything else.  Its a useful test, as I try it on every device, so can compare the experience.  Again, sorry to say, the lag between tilting the screen, and the aircraft actually moving on screen made it really hard to use.  My worry is a child would equally find it difficult, and just give up.*** Storage *** 90% ***In terms of storage it comes complete with 8Gb of space although not all of that is fully available, and I found out of the box there was about 7.7Gb left.  Of course, you can always add a 32Gb Micro SD card for as little as 10.00 on Amazon which should be enough for most people to store books, videos and music.*** Battery Life *** 80% ***Finally, you should expect to charge this every day.  I got about 3-4 hours out of it before I needed to charge it.  Unusually, in addition to a standard micro-USB connection (to connect the tablet to a computer for backup), this device has a separate pin socket for charging, and it comes with the UK plug.*** Value for Money *** 90% ***In terms of value for money, this really is terrific.  At the time of writing, this is one of the cheapest tablet computers on Amazon, and provided you take account of the limitations, its terrific value for money.  So, OK, it doesnt have a metal back and gorilla glass screen of an iPad mini - but it does almost everything an iPad can do at a fraction of the cost.*** Overall Conclusion *** 70% ***In conclusion, if youve never owned a tablet computer before, and want to dip your toe in the market, this is a functional (if rather limited) device - the lack of a a bluetooth connection is particularly poor.  The screen and sound quality could be better, it could be a bit quicker switching from landscape to portrait, but youre getting a usable tablet for little money.Technically, this is not a bad device.  A 1.2 GHz processor and 8Gb of storage on a 7 tablet computer is certainly a good starting point.  Even the lack of bluetooth and poor sound quality could be forgiven, although Im less impressed by the muted screen colours both in use in photographs.  For me, what really lets this down though, is the lack of responsiveness.  A tablet is designed to be tilted from horizontal and vertical, and should be responsive in basic games.  Likewise, the fact the screen doesnt immediately respond to two finger zooming is a concern, although web sites and you tube display fine.My advice is if you only intend to use this for displaying video from BBC iPlayer, Amazon Instant Video or You Tube itd be fine, but I think a child would become quickly frustrated if playing games on this.  Having said that, its useable, and as long as youre aware of the limitations its a good starter tablet computer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZO9XMHVW4LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQBYZG#wasThisHelpful","R1BZO9XMHVW4LZ","A1TUL3FFHYEXBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUL3FFHYEXBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having reviewed on Amazon for a while, I was pleased to receive this replacement metal Apple Watch band in return for an independent and unbiased review.Like many people, I've been pleased with my Apple Watch, but dismayed at the hugely expensive Apple watch bands. I'm sure they're top quality, but they're eye waterinngly expensive.Equally, I was a little skeptical of the cheaper 3rd party alternatives, but I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this particular watch band.Measuring 800mm long by 22mm wide, it's really quite impressively made, with machine milled steel links, and has a wonderfully ""chunky"" feel to it. It clips on and off from the watch within seconds which means you can quickly change it, for example to the rubber one to go off to the gym, but it adds a level of style and quality.The ""chunky"" feel of this watch is partly due to the heavy weight. At 91g it has a nice heft to it, and feels great on the wrist. To put this in context an Sports model with the standard black band (ie. watch and band) is 56g in weight.The release catch requires both finger and thumb to open it which means it's highly unlikely to accidentallly pop open, and risk losing your watch. Even if it did, it's the ""closed"" design, so the strap will stay loose on your wrist, but I wore it for a weekend, and didn't have any problems at all.Finally, the fact it comes with a device to adjust the size is a bonus, as it saves you a visit (plus the cost) to a jeweller to have it adjusted. Top marks for that.My only advice is to clearly request the colour you need. I have a ""Space Grey"" Apple Sport model, but received the silver band, and it just doesn't go with this model at all. I took it into the Apple store to compare, and it looks great on the Steel ""Watch"" model which has a more silver colour.I do think this would look brilliant in the grey colour though.Overall, I think you'll be delighted with this watch band. Fantastic build quality, lovely finish (absolutely no sharp edges or rough patches), and a great price.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFD9DMUNZRXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU5GHS4#wasThisHelpful","R1LFD9DMUNZRXO","A1TUL3FFHYEXBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUL3FFHYEXBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Theres an awful lot of these ""power banks available on Amazon, but I personally prefer these smaller sizes as youll always have them with you.  While its great to have enough power to keep you going for days, I personally find Ive only ever used mine in an emergency.At just under 4 inches long by an inch thick, this little device sits nicely in the hand.  Designed to be kept in a pocket or handbag, wrapped in white plastic shell, it weights just 69g (to put this in context, much less than an iPhone 6 at 135g), so you can carry it with you everywhere.The battery is rated at 3,000  mAh (the higher the better).  To put this in context, here's the battery capacity (mAh) of some of the more popular smartphones:-* Google Nexus 5 - 2,300 mAh* Samsung Galaxy S3 - 2,100 mAh* Samsung Galaxy S4 - 2,600 mAh* Samsung Galaxy S5 - 2,500 mAh* Samsung Galaxy S6 - 2,600 mAh* Apple iPhone 5 - 1,400 mAh* Apple iPhone 5S - 1,570 mAh* Apple iPhone 6 - 1,810 mAh* Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Phablet) 2,915 mAhEach of the above are estimates (you never quite get 100% efficiency out of a battery), but theyll give you an idea of the power youll have.  Certainly enough to charge your smartphone in an emergency.What's Good about it?-----------------------------* Nice little device, small and light weight, but sits nicely in the hand* Solid build quality - should last for years* Comes with a USB to Micro-USB cable (to charge your android smartphone)What's not so good?* It doesnt come with a wall charger or USB to iPhone cable (but these devices never do).* As it doesnt have a light, theres no indication how much charge it has, so keep it topped up if you use it regularlyConclusion---------------Small and lightweight - great for emergenciesDisclosure: I was kindly sent this by the manufacturer to give an independent unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15WIDDP2V9YZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJSX7ZC#wasThisHelpful","R15WIDDP2V9YZY","A1TUL3FFHYEXBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUL3FFHYEXBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Remington hair dryer is supposed to be superior to 'ordinary' dryers because it has an advanced ceramic coating on the grills.  This is purported to give frizz-free hair dried with the thing.  Maybe it does, but it hasn't dramatically evidenced much to that end.  I guess it couldn't hurt.The main things that stand out about this dryer is how well it is made, the rubber-like finish and how versatile it is.  With two attachment heads, 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings the appliance has a lot of choices built in.The cool shot setting is a plus as is forcefulness of the air stream. The purplish color is attractive and it just seems like it would last for years of use.The Remington AC2015C is an excellent dryer and it is accurately priced in the mid-range for similar units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31VVQSWTUFT6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRN7SB8#wasThisHelpful","R31VVQSWTUFT6P","A1KY5G5FP31F2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY5G5FP31F2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these high quality UGG slippers and they look great.  They are warm, soft and generally comfortable to wear.  However, the heel is cut a bit low and wide and the slippers tend to slip in that area when walking. The soles are heavy and do not bend easily.  Perhaps with some 'breaking in' the soles will ease up and improve those slipping heels.

"This is another model among many in the George Foreman line.  There are George Forman grills in a round shape, rectangular ones, lids with vents, some with temperature gauges, several with stands for outdoor use,  A few with removable cooking plates and grills in various colors.  This one (the GFO240S) is some of all of these.This is a basic outdoor/indoor electric grill and probably near the bottom of the line for George Foreman grills.  It comes in one color (gray), it has a lid without a vent and is round without a temperature gauge and the grilling plate is not removable. However it has the essentials and probably grills as well as the other George Forerman models.The GFO240S is certainly a very nice electric grill. It is well built and easy to assemble.  It does a great job with cooking meat, fish and veggies.  It is supposed to be large enough for 15 servings.  I have not put that to the test, but the grill is quite largeabout twenty inches across (240 square inches they say).The grill has the standard plug-in temperature switch found on George Foreman electric grills with adjustable control and indicator light. The grill has a removable stand used for outdoor cooking, but the main unit can be detached and the grill can then be used on a counter or table. The big aluminum lid has a sturdy keep cool handle.Grilling on an electric grill is simple and doesn't require propane or charcoal or have flare ups, but for that convenience one must give up a bit of smoky flavor. A steak or burger still show sear marks and the meat is juicy and tasty. Peppers, mushrooms and onions cook nicely and also show the desirable grill marks.The non-stick grilling plate is easy to clean with a paper towel and there is a removable grease tray.There is a brief instruction booklet that comes with the grill and it includes some interesting recipes.I will be using my George Foreman Grill for occasions where my big Weber gas grill is not appropriate or when I don't want to go the propane route. There are times when simply plugging in an electric grill is preferable to messing around with LP tanks or charcoal. This grill is a perfect choice where apartment or condo restrictions forbid gas and charcoal grills.If you are looking for a basic, no frills, electric grill this George Foreman GFO240S will fill the bill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SH1QB3N3IOZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRH3HA#wasThisHelpful","R3SH1QB3N3IOZD","A1KY5G5FP31F2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY5G5FP31F2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After a professional hearing exam and consultation with an audiologist I was advised to get a $2000 hearing aid and probably one of those for each ear.  Faced with such a large investment in a device(s) that might not do much more than just amplify sounds.  I am 82 years old with a significant hearing loss in one ear, but I really didn't want to spend so much money for a high tech hearing aid or maybe two of them.The New Digital Hearing Amplifier seemed like it might be worth a try.  I thought at $60 it would be good experiment.  I had already tried three of the really cheap gadgets like the TV Ears, Whisper Rechargeable amplifier and such.  Those cheap ones were not very good and a couple of them really didn't do a lot except make things louder and sounds were hollow and unpleasant.  None of them fit very well. The New Digital Amplifier could have been another one of those--it wasn't.The New Digital Amplifier is smaller than the lower priced and junky devices.  I would say the size of the New Digital Amplifier is somewhere in-between the large size of the cheap gadgets and the small size of the bona fide behind the ear hearing aids.  It is comfortable to wear and will work in either ear.  i wear mine with glasses and have no problems. The controls (on/off, volume and mode) are easy to reach and adjust.  The 'mode' adjustment is a high frequency/low frequency switch. Once the adjustments are made the amplifier holds them so one doesn't have to re-set the device each time it is powered up.The color is tan and does not stand out all that much positioned behind the ear.  However, I suppose this device is not for the very vain. There are ear tips in three sizes, three batteries and a cleaning brush provided in a nice storage case.I am using only one New Digital Amplifier and I am amazed at what I am experiencing with it. I can hear the TV, voices and ambient sounds I had not heard in years.  There is no humming or echo and the background noises are minimal albeit not blocked completely. I did encounter a feedback squeal when I sometimes accidentally cupped my hand over the microphone and speaker at the same time.  That was my own fault.The amplifier is powered by a single LR44 battery, but it is not a battery hog and replacement batteries are quite cheap.  I prefer this battery powered design preferable to the rechargeable type.  Having used a rechargeable amplifier I can tell you it is a lot easier to replace a little aspirin sized battery than wait all night for a recharge.There are some competition amplifiers out there that appear to be similar in looks and I do not know anything about them, but the New Digital Amplifier was a good choice for me and I am completely satisfied with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IO0JJJQOLT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HKKOGJO#wasThisHelpful","R36IO0JJJQOLT6","A1KY5G5FP31F2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY5G5FP31F2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the past 3 years I have been using a 27"" 1920x1080 Asus monitor for my PTC Creo CAD work.  I like the size of that monitor, but being that it's a TN panel I find it to be fatiguing after a long day.  My experience with IPS displays in several of my Chromebooks (HP Chromebook 11, Toshiba Chromebook 2, and a Pixel) made me realize how much easier it is to look at these IPS/PLS displays for extended periods of time.  When I saw that the price of this monitor had dropped to the mid $400's I snapped one up.  I connected this Asus to my Nvidia Quadro 5000 via Display Port, and it looks and works great for me.  For my CAD work everything looks great, and I find that I feel much better after a long day of looking at this screen that I had with my old monitor.  I was a bit concerned that the Creo text and icons would be too small, but things look really good (albeit smaller), and I actually like that I can have more icons and tree items visible without having to expand menus or scroll the tree.  I like all of the connectivity options, and the fact that all of the various cables were included.  I like having the ability to adjust the height, which I couldn't do with my old Asus.  And, the cheap built-in speakers actually sound okay (for system sounds).  I really like that the bezel around the screen is a matte finish, because the glossy bezel of my old monitor always showed the reflection of the lights in the ceiling (very annoying).  The non-glare coating (as opposed to a true matte screen) also works well.The only issue I have run into is a single stuck (on red) pixel.  I hoped it might un-stick itself after a couple of long days, but unfortunately, it hasn't.  I wouldn't fret too much about a single pixel if it were in one of the corners, but this one is near the center of the screen right in line with my left eye.  Even with it's tiny size, I am constantly aware of this pixel; especially with the light background of Creo's main window.  It has just been too distracting for me, so I decided to do a return and see what happens.  But, I still love this monitor and I'm hoping for the best with the new one.  It actually amazes me that you can have nearly 3.7 million pixels on a panel and only have 1 bad one, but it's also crazy how much that 1 tiny pixel can stand out when it's right in the middle of the screen.For my specific needs this is a great monitor, and I'm hoping to get many years of service from it.  If anyone has any ""Creo specific"" questions about this monitor, I'd be happy to answer as best I can.I'll be sure to update this review when I get the replacement monitor.I received my replacement monitor, and it also had a single goofy pixel in almost the same area as the original.  However, this one only shows up against a black background.  Since I never really work with a black background, I decided I'd keep it rather than continuing to mess around with doing exchanges.  Another thing I have noticed, now that I have been using my replacement for a few days, is that the fan on my first unit was seriously loud.  This new one is much quieter, and the monitor also seems to run cooler.  I even did a test where I cranked up the heat in my office, and while the fan was audible, it was not loud at all; even in a pretty hot environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CNET6IZUDNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009C3M7H0#wasThisHelpful","R31CNET6IZUDNP","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As far as I can tell after a thorough inspection, this is NOT a knock-off product; which is a good thing.  However, I wouldn't call it ""factory fresh"" either.  The unit I received functions fine; it charges at the same rate as my original charger, and the indicator light looks and functions like the original as well.  But, it was in no way packaged as it would have been had it come from Google.  The cord looked as though it had been re-wrapped, and didn't have the same little tapes holding the loops together that the original had.  It should also be noted that while you get the charging block and the removable plug insert, it does not include the extension cord with the grounded plug (even though it's shown in the picture).  The little 2GB flash drive works fine as well.

"My headphone stable includes the likes of Sennheiser HD600's, Beyerdynamics DT-880's and AKG Q701's powered by Amps from Schiit, Nuforce, and Little Dot, so one might question why I would get so much enjoyment out of these Momentums.  The fact is, these are some fun little headphones if you use them for what they were designed for.  Head over to iTunes, Spotify, or Google Play Music and look at whats mostly topping the pop charts these days, or drop into a club and listen to what the DJs are playing; youll understand the the type of music that these phones sound the best with.  Classical, Jazz, Singer-Songwriter, Adult Contemporary your style; then there are much better options out there.  Drake, Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande, Zedd, David Guetta, Astrix; you will probably really like these.  These headphones werent designed and tuned to be audiophile headphones, they were set up to play back todays popular music.The efficiency of these headphones is excellent, meaning they can play loud with much less power (like what youd get from a phone, tablet, or laptop).  The bass can hit plenty hard (try Astrix High on Mel), though it cant always reach as deep as Id prefer and sometimes falls off too soon.  However, I noticed that the more I used them, the better the lows sounded.  The highs roll off pretty quickly too, but the mids are well represented, and for a headphone with a DJ Tune these Momentums sound excellent.  Ive found the imaging to be pretty decent as well (for a set of closed phones).  The build quality is top notch, and I like all the available colors and different materials used.  They can feel a little tight after a while, which is to be expected for on-ear headphones, but the clamping force will soften up a bit as you use them, and you can always relax them by working the headband a bit.  Its important that you angle the cups properly and place them on your ears/head correctly.  The discomfort level can really take off quickly if you dont wear these properly on your head.  The material used for the cups is very soft, never itchy, and has never made me sweat.  I use Android phones, so I cant speak to the function of the remote (I believe it will have limited function with an Android), and if I did have one gripe with many of the Sennheiser phones I have used, its that the chords seem to stay kinked forever.  I appreciate the included bag and soft-case, but since the headphones dont fold up, the overall package is rather large for an on-the-go headphone.If you use these Momentums with a laptop/desktop computer you can really make them sing with an external DAC/headphone amp.  I use mine mostly with my Pixel, and when I run them through my NuForce uDAC-3 the sound is very impressive.  In the end; for the buck-twenty I paid for these they were a great investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QRBYQ26PXHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D77UA44#wasThisHelpful","R19QRBYQ26PXHZ","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Koss Porta Pros at work on a daily basis for almost 20 years now, and they still amaze me.  But, I have been finding that there are more and more times when I'd like to have a little more isolation from the noise of the office without having to turn up the music to a level that's distracting.  I have plenty of closed headphones at home, but I'd rather leave a pair of $40 headphones laying around the office than sets that are far more expensive.  When I saw that these Koss ProDJ100's were going for cheap, I ordered a pair.  Based on the response curves I found online, I knew I'd have to do some equalizing to tune them more to my liking.  These just aren't the kind of headphones that you can plug right in and get some nice natural sound out of.  I plugged them into my little NuForce uDAC-2 and fired them up.  It did take a bit of time, but I was able create a curve I was happy with for the volume I listen at.  After a week, they had settled in a bit, and I made some minor adjustments, and after 2 weeks I really felt like I had them dialed in pretty well (for a set of $40 cans).  I was hoping I could get some sound similar to my Sony MDR-V6's (that I run without EQ), but I had to settle for ""close enough"".  I know that some users disagree with the ""DJ"" labeling of these headphones, but with the way they are tuned I did find that they gave the best overall sound when using them with that style of music (when listening without an EQ).  One thing I did not like was the fact the sound (mostly on the low end) would change quite a bit if I didn't maintain a tight seal to my head with the earcups.  I have experienced this issue to a much lesser degree when using other closed headphones, but with the Koss' it was very pronounced.  And that led to the final issue I had.  I probably would have kept them, even though I own a lot of other headphones, but in the end they were just too uncomfortable for me and I found I could not wear them for any extended period of time.  It wasn't really the size of the earcup, it was the shape.  The MDR-V6's have small cups, but they are oval shaped.  The small round cups on the ProDJ100's either hurt the top of my ear or the bottom; depending on how I had them adjusted (and I don't consider my ears large at all).I could have lived with the sound of these headphones considering the occasional use they would get, but I found them to be too uncomfortable so I sent them back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGA119X6DRI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X1BEKI#wasThisHelpful","RPGA119X6DRI1","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's nice to have a big pockets front and back that can hold the charger cords, and the other little pockets come in handy too.

"I couldn't tell you the brand of charger I had previously been using in my car with my Nexus 5, but it could barely keep up when using the GPS.  The phone would stay powered, but the battery wouldn't really charge.  And forget about using the thing with 2 devices.  This Anker has much more power, and when I get where I'm going my phone actually has a greater charge than when I left.  It's a nice solid fit into my car's socket, which is a benefit too as the old one would sometimes work its way out.  I have also used it with 2 devices connected and it does slow the charge speed a bit, but nothing like the old unit.  All-in-all, a great purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A13YZ7AQNPGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D82O68Y#wasThisHelpful","R2A13YZ7AQNPGH","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this cable to connect a DAC to a tube headphone amp.  I wanted something high quality but flexible.  I do wish I could have gotten a set that was half this length.  The connectors are solid and they haven't stretched out like the ones on my last set of cables.  Is there a sound benefit to monster cables?  I'd say nothing that pretty much anyone could hear (especially at such short distances).  The value, I think, comes in the quality of materials and the durability of the cables.  If you're having interference issues these would also help, as Monster products are always very well shielded.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG7ST7L8MAYQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00104OMWM#wasThisHelpful","RG7ST7L8MAYQE","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this for my son, and he's happy with it.  The fit was good for him and the thing didn't really shrink too much when we washed it.  It's a pretty light material when compared to some of the hoodies he owns so we'll see how well it holds up.  I though it was pretty pricey and I hope he doesn't outgrow it too fast.  If I had one complaint, it would be that the image isn't as clear and bright as it appears in the photo.

"My daughter had the original model of these shoes and she had completely worn them out.  She liked the originals so much that she wanted another pair, so we grabbed a set of these.  She has been just as happy with this new model as with her old ones.  She runs quite a bit, and she does go through shoes pretty fast.  These super light shoes aren't built to last forever, but that's what I'd expect from something so light.  If you're hard on shoes, you'll no doubt wear these out pretty quickly.

"I have a lot of Chromebooks, and I have purchased 6 Acer C720's since the release last year.  I have an original 4GB and 2GB model,  I purchased two of the 2GB models for my nephew's, I set my sister up with a 2GB-32GBSSD and I just bought myself a 4GB i3.  All of the C720s have been flawless performers as of this writing.  They are fast, reliable, pretty well built, and they are an excellent value.  I've also purchased 2 Chromebook 11's (1st gen with IPS), a Samsung Series 3, and a Toshiba 13.  We also have a Chromebase and a Chromebox.  All of these have been problem free as well.  I have written lengthy reviews for most of these machines, but for this unit I just want to stress what a great value it is.  Be careful of non-Amazon sellers trying to gouge on these machines.  They should cost you $200 or less.  And please take the time to research what a Chromebook is, what it can do, and what it can't do.  The majority of negative Chromebook reviews are written by those who didn't know what it was they were purchasing and bought on price alone.  If anyone has a specific question they would like to ask about the C720 line I would be happy to answer it as best as I can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ZUU1QCAV9RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNPD1VW#wasThisHelpful","R29ZUU1QCAV9RW","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had some Sony MDR-V6's for a lot of years now, and after reading tons of opinions on how they compare to their sibling, these MDR-7506's, I figured I would pick a pair up and do my own comparison.  I know this horse has been beaten to death, but it only took a short amount of listening to realize the differences.  But, before I get into it too far I just want to say that both models are excellent headphones; and it's amazing that either set can be had for less than $100.And a WARNING to all buyers.  Because these phones have been around forever, and because they are so popular (I think Sony sells more than 35,000 pairs of these a month) there are lots of fakes out there.  You can research this on the web, but the safest way to insure you are getting the real deal is to make sure that when you purchase here on Amazon you only buy when it says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"".  It is the easiest way to be sure you're getting the genuine article.Everybody hears differently, and everyone ""listens"" differently.  We don't all enjoy the same types of music, and similarly, every set of headphones is not necessarily suited for every genre of music.  We all own different source components, and most of us have a limit as to what we are willing to spend on our gear.  I believe every headphone review should include a brief summary of the reviewer's musical tastes, sources, and gear and should always including references to other sets of cans they own, have auditioned, liked, or disliked.  With so many variables affecting peoples like or dislike of any pair of phones it is my goal to help those with similar musical tastes and similar gear to determine whether or not these headphones will be a good investment for them personally.To that end; I listen to music in practically every genre.  I tend to go through different phases, but I enjoy Mozart as much as Metallica, 80's one hit wonders and New Orleans Jazz, Lady Antebellum or Lady Gaga, Eminem to Zedd.  Music has so much to offer in all genres that one could spend a lifetime discovering new things they like.  I use my computer to play all the usual manner of digital files, and an Onkyo C-7030 CD player to handle disk duty.  Both feed into my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  The digital files via USB and the CDs via analog RCA (the Onkyo has excellent onboard D/A conversion).  I have also been playing around with a Little Dot MK2 ii Vacuum Tube Amp (which I am really starting to love).  It should also be noted that I use no equalizer to modify the sound of my music (because I don't have one available in my setup).  My headphones include Sony MDR-V6s and these MDR-7506s, V-Moda Crossfade LPs and M-100s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DT-880 250ohm Premiums, Sennheiser HD 598s and HD 600s (my personal favorite) as well as my 4th pair of Koss Porta-Pros (easy to exchange when you live in Milwaukee) .  I've tried Grado SR 80s and SR 225s (just too darn uncomfortable), some Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250ohms (I prefered the DT 880s), and my son even owns a pair of first generation Beats Solo phones (Yuk).  The other day I threw away some Denon's (no clue what model, but circa 1990) and a set of Sony MDR-V600s that were both totally worn out.  I also own lots of buds as well (my Klipsh X10s being my favorite).Like I said at the beginning, these headphones sound great.  They are by far my favorite set of closed phones.  The crossfades are fun (they'll make your teeth chatter), but the sound is very unnatural.  The ATH-M50s sound excellent as well, but I prefer the Sony's more natural midrange.  I like them with most genre's of music, but I prefer them with classical, jazz, adult contemporary, jazz rock, and other similar genres of music.  The 7506's (and V6's) also give the widest soundstage of all my closed cans.  When comparing the sound to the V6's I would say this.  Both models have some of the most natural sounding mids I have heard in a headphone.  The V6s have more bass and noticeably higher highs, where the 7506's are flatter through the audible spectrum.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  It isn't hard to hear the difference, and you can see it as well by going to Headphone dot com's ""build a graph"" page and comparing the two.  The build a graph is an excellent page and when I look at the graphs for the various phones I own it shows exactly what I'm hearing myself.  I have heard many reasons for the differences between the two sets of Sonys from wiring to cup shape, and I've read all the references to the parts list that says they have all the same pieces, but all I'll say again is that there is a difference.  If you like a flatter sound with less of a ""smile curve"" then these 7506's are what you're looking for.  If you like a bit more bass and treble I'd recommend the V6's (though the highs can cause fatigue after a while).  If you are looking for cans to monitor or edit video then the 7506's are the ticket.  It's amazing how accurately they can playback the sound I record with my video camera, and it's no surprise that you see these on the heads of people in the movie business when you watch behind the scenes extras on DVD's and Blu-Rays.  I have taken the V6's to work and I use them with my little Nuforce uDAC-2 as the two pair together very well, and the 7506's are my go-to phones at home when open cans won't do.  The phones are very efficient as well.  They play plenty loud without a lot of power, though they sound even better with a nice amp.  They are also very revealing.  While you will hear lots of details in your music, you will also hear all of the flaws.  Music with accentuated highs may also sound shrill and sibilant when using these phones.  If you want lots of booming bass you'd be best to look elsewhere.  The 7506's have nice low, accurate, detailed bass, but they aren't thumpers by any means (nor are the V6's). If you want some serious thump on a budget watch for the V-Moda Crossfade LP's to go on sale (you will sacrifice detail and clarity, however).The build quality is excellent and I'm alright with the earpads wearing out and needing replacement from time to time (I'm on at least my 5th set in 2 decades with the V6's).  All earcups need to be replaced sooner or later, and if you shop around you can find the Sony replacements for a cheap price.  If you opt for some of the velour replacements that are out there you will (or you should) notice a change in the sound (I've tried them with the v6's).  It's also important to watch the foam part of the cups that covers the driver.  If it starts to break down it will get pushed into the holes in the front of the driver itself and it will ruin it (this is what happened to my V600's).  The phones are very light, the comfort is excellent, the clamping pressure is pretty light, and the sound isolation is really good too.  I also like the coiled cord and the quick change screw plug.  I have never had an issue with my cord on my V6's in almost 20 years and I don't foresee a problem with the 7506's.  The carry bag is handy and surprisingly durable as well.  I do wish they locked in a little tighter when you opened them as they often seem to want to close back up while trying to put them on.  You also have to be careful for the right side wire as it can get pinched in the whole works and possibly become crimped.You just can't go wrong with The 7506's or the V6's at the price they sell for.  You just have to decide which response curve you prefer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I61IQYXIQV1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AJIF4E#wasThisHelpful","R2I61IQYXIQV1S","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Probably my third favorite Moriarty book behind Alice and Secret.  I just started reading the new ""Big Little Lies"" and it hooked me pretty quickly.  I was hoping for one of her awesome epilogues, but the book did seem to end rather abruptly without one.  My favorite part of the book was the way my feelings towards the main characters changed from chapter to chapter.  One chapter you like someone and the next you don't.

"Last year I pre-ordered the original Acer C720-2800 4GB Chromebook and received it the day after the release.  I did have a minor issue with a rattle in the touchpad which was a simple fix that I addressed when I upgraded the SSD to a 128GB unit.  The rattle aside, my C720, and all of our Chromebooks, Chromebox, and Chromebase , have been flawless performers.  The C720 2GB has been perfect, I love the screen and keyboard on the HP 11, my Toshiba 13 is great, and the Chromebox and Chromebase have replaced our desktops.  My son took over the 4GB C720 when I got the Toshiba, and he has pretty much retired his Samsung Series 3 that we purchased almost 2 years ago.  It still runs well, but the battery life isn't what it used to be.  I purchased this new i3 C720 4GB (my 4th C720) primarily because I wanted to see if the performance is worth the additional investment.  However, because I'm a dedicated Chrome OS user who's looking ahead to what's in store for Chrome OS and it's evolving compatibility with Android (and my Nexus 5) I also wanted to make sure I had the fastest Chromebook available (with the exception of the Pixel) to take advantage of forthcoming features.For this review, I will primarily be comparing this C720 i3 4GB to my original C720 Haswell 4GB. With all the Chrome OS devices available today, it's impossible  to reference them all. If you'd like my opinion on how this i3 stacks up against some of the popular models please feel free to ask.  Again, our family has the Samsung Series 3, three C720's (2GB and 4GB Haswells and the i3), two HP-11s (the ones with the good screen), the 13"" Toshiba, an Asus Chromebox, and an LG Chromebase.  I am also well versed in the other models available or coming soon.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:  Love it or hate it, it's still a C720.  As I unboxed it, I again wished Acer would pack their Chromebooks better, but nothing was damaged or strewn around the box.  I was a bit surprised that the battery was totally dead when I opened the lid as all my previous Chromebooks had a decent charge when I got them.  I plugged it in, and from totally empty to full charge took just under 2 hours (I was at work and not using it during the charge).  Log in was simple; all of my apps, extensions, and settings loaded incredibly fast, I did an update (it was still at version 31 and is now 36), and was up and running faster than with any of my other Chromebooks.  The power brick is the same as my old C720, and at 9 feet long I still wish it was a bit longer (The Toshiba 13 charger totals 12 feet).  A few other quick impressions that I will cover in detail below; the screen seems to be the same, but the keyboard has a distinctly different feel to it.  I also noticed this on the C720 2GB I purchased last month for my sister.  No touchpad rattle; which is good, and the overall fit and finish seems to have improved a bit over the past 10 months.  But, the main reason to buy this i3 is.......PERFORMANCE:  Yes... The i3 Chromebook is fast!  The speed is immediately apparent with this machine.  From power off to the login screen is around 3 to maybe 4 seconds, which is half the time it takes my Haswell start.  Both machines are pretty much instant on from sleep, but that's really where the performance similarities stop.  I will include some quick benchmarks I ran at the end of this section, but I have always felt that the best measure of performance is how the computer feels when you're using it for whatever it is you use your computer for.  I have a monster Windows 7 XEON CPU CAD workstation I use at work and this i3 browses just as fast.  One of my primary uses for my Chromebook/box at home is listening to music.  I connect my Chromebook/box to an external DAC, via USB, which feeds my vacuum tube headphone amp with streaming music from Google Play Music Unlimited.  This usually works well enough with the old Acer and the Haswell Chromebox until I start browsing other sites.  Depending on the contents of a page, I sometimes get a very annoying skipping sound (like a machine gun) during loading that drives me crazy.  Listening to music while browsing with my wireless mouse would also cause the cursor to skip or behave erratically sometimes as well. I connected my DAC up to this i3, started some music, opened some known problem sites, and had no issues. I was all over the web and everything ran very smoothly; even with the mouse connected.  I have to say right now, that getting rid of that issue alone was worth the price I paid for this machine.  My Google Play Music page has tons of songs, playlists, and radio stations, so it does take a bit of time to load, but with the i3 it loaded almost twice as fast as with the Haswell.  HD shows on Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime Instant Video, YouTube, and several network sites started fast and played smoothly without interruption.  The only issues I noticed were caused by the poor service I often get from my ISP (I pay for 50mbps and I expect 50mbps).  I don't really tend to be a tab maniac, but it's nice to know that I was able to get this machine with 4GB of ram.  My 2GB machines work fine for me, but the 4GB should help going forward with Chrome OS and the internet.  I also observed that the i3 loaded some rather large Google Documents very quickly.  My Gmail opens a lot quicker, as does the Google Plus Photo app; and the video previews in the photo app run much smoother as well.  All of this speed does come with a small compromise though, and it's important to note that this system still uses a small fan.  Like my old Acer, the fan is incredibly quiet, and with the activity happening around the house I never hear them running on either machine (as compared to the jet engine on our old HP laptop).  It's only in the early morning or late evening that I even realize there is a fan coming on from time to time (sometimes for only a few seconds).  So, does this mean that the Haswells are slow?  Absolutely not.  They just aren't as snappy as this i3.  And that snap comes at a price.BENCHMARKS:  This first set of benchmarks were completed as a logged in user and are an average of three tests.  HTML5 Fishbowl (Around 495 fish at 60 FPS).  Peacekeeper (3205 and 7/7 for HTML5 browsing).  SunSpider (296ms).  Octane (14374).  This set of tests was done in guest mode and also averaged results of three tests.  HTML5 Fishbowl (Up to 540 fish at 60 FPS).  Peacekeeper (3246 and 7/7 for HTML5 browsing).  SunSpider (282ms).  Octane (14237).  I had read comments by people who ran these tests saying the results were better in guest mode, but I would say that based on my results, guest mode isn't really a factor.  While running the Peacekeeper test I was also impressed at how well the video tests performed with this i3 and the HD Graphics 4400.  The test with the small spheres inside the big sphere looked incredibly smooth, as did the HD codec tests where you fly above the river.  Much smoother than they look on any of our other Chrome machines.SCREEN:  As I mentioned earlier, the screen looks pretty much the same as my old C720.  I got myself an HP 11 about a month ago, and while the thing is slow, the IPS screen is wonderful.  The colors on the i3 are a bit washed out, but decent, and the text is pretty clear, but the contrast is poor and the vertical viewing angles are very limited.  Streaming shows with lots of night or dark scenes yield a pretty poor picture and you have to tilt the screen just right to be able to differentiate close colors (like dark browns and blacks).  Still, this is unfortunately par for the course with Chromebooks, and many of us are still waiting for that fast machine with serious speed and a great display.  On a positive note, this i3 performed a lot better while extending or mirroring the screen via HDMI than my old C720 did.  Everything just seemed to run a lot smoother with 2 screens going, which is a testament to the improved graphics section in this model.  And, the picture this thing put up on the 24"" Asus IPS was impressive.  For the record though, I would have to say that this display is certainly the biggest compromise with the Acer i3.KEYBOARD: Aside from the obvious speed boost, the keyboard on the newer C720's seems to have also been improved.  It isn't as nice as the HP11's, but it is certainly quieter and more responsive that the old Acer.  The keys feel a bit firmer/heavier (in a good way), and travel seems to have been slightly increased a bit as well.  I would probably put this keyboard it as my second favorite, ahead of the Samsung Series 3 and my Toshiba 13.TOUCHPAD:  The touchpad feels the same to me as my old C720, and I was glad to get one without a rattle (always a fear for me when buying a C720, though I only ever had the one).  I still prefer the pad on the Toshiba for it's texture that never seems to feel like it's getting oily, and the pad on the HP 11 that just plain works well for me.  I also need to add that I really enjoy using Chrome OS touchpads in general.  Once you get the hang of them and learn ALL of the gestures (1, 2, and 3 fingers), reverting to a pad with left and right buttons and scrolling partitions seems very cumbersome.  This i3 also worked perfectly with my little Logitech wireless mouse, though the low Logitech DPI rate really slows down the cursor.BATTERY LIFE:  I'll address this mainly in perceived time and not actual hours, because that's the easiest way for me to rate the battery.  The first charge did seem to run down pretty fast (less than 5 hours I'd say), but it was the first charge, I was all over the web, I had my uDAC-3 plugged in, and I had the screen all the way up most of that time.  The screen is certainly the biggest battery killer, along with my Nuforce uDAC when I use it, and if you use the display as low as you can tolerate you will get the maximum usage times out of your battery.  I also like that the Haswells and this i3 don't seem to drain a lot when they're sleeping.  This is an issue with our ARM Chromebooks.  They'll run down pretty quickly, even when they're in sleep mode.  If you really want to save your battery power it's best to just turn the Chromebook off.  After all, they start in just a few seconds.SPEAKERS:  The speakers are pretty much the same also.  As long as you're on a table or using a lap desk they can play plenty loud for their size.  I never expected much from such tiny little things so I've never felt disappointed with their sound.  The Toshiba's are a bit louder, and the HP's probably sound the best.  I also have a Bose Soundlink Mini that paired up quickly using the Bluetooth and played without any problems.  Running music out of the combo headphone/mic jack works really good too, and sounded nice with my Koss Porta Pros.GRAB BAG:  The ports are exactly the same as the Haswells, the SD cards still stick out pretty far, and still just one USB 2, one USB 3, and the HDMI.  The ports may feel a little tight at first, but they'll loosen up over a couple uses.  I'm plugging and unplugging things all the time, and I've never had any problems with my Chromebooks.  If you need more ports, you can always grab a USB hub.  My cloud printer was available as soon as I logged on, and I love that this thing instantly became MY Chromebook just by logging in.  I was able to connect my phone and my digital camera, and Chrome found the DCIM folders and uploaded my pictures (though the pics I take with my phone automatically sync to my cloud drive already).  The webcam is still pretty bad in all but the best light, but I also have a Logitech USB webcam that works well with Chrome OS.  The chassis of this C720 is pretty rigid as well, and only my HP 11 feels more solid when lifted by the corner.  And please, NEVER handle ANY computer by the screen/lid!  This Chromebook also worked well with my Plugable USB 2 to Ethernet adapter, which is handy to have.  As to the SSD; I had put a 128GB unit in my first 4GB C720, but since that time I have also started using the cloud a lot more.  The extra 16GB of space you get with this model is nice if you travel, because you can take along several movies (yes, you can download your Google Play videos for offline use now), plenty of music, and still have space left over.So is this the Chromebook for you?  Aside from the inability to install software, any Chrome OS device you purchase will require a compromise on your part; even the incredible Pixel with its shorter battery life (that I could totally live with by the way).  While this C720 i3 is really fast, and an overall improvement over my original C720, it still doesn't have the great IPS screen or keyboard of my original HP 11. But, the HP 11 has only adequate speed, short battery life, and long charge times.  If you want serious battery life in a great all-around package then you should consider the new, and highly rated, Asus Bay Trail Chromebooks (C200 and C300), though you will sacrifice a small bit of performance and they do come with TN panels.  The first Dell Chromebooks were praised for their great build quality, and now they are said to be coming out with an i3 Chromebook as well; no word though on whether or not they'll include an IPS display.  The new Samsung Chromebook 2's are very well built as well, but again, you will be making a compromise in speed, battery life, and screen quality (based solely on my extensive research).  The Toshiba 13 is a great value with very good performance, great battery life, and a decent build.  The extra screen real estate is nice too, but the low resolution takes away some of the sharpness.  The bottom line on the C720 i3 is simple.  If you have to have the fastest Chromebook on the market (besides the Pixel) this is the machine for you.  The improved music playback alone made this purchase totally worth it for me.  Just remember though, you can get the exact same package with very good performance for just $179 with the Haswell C720 2GB and you'll still have $200 in your pocket.  If you have to have this i3 you could also drop to the 2GB model and save $30 (Though I recommend the 4GB if you're getting the i3).  In the end, all the Acer C720's are a great value, and the i3 models offer a great new addition to the line.If anyone has any questions or comments I would be more than happy to answer them as best I can.  I will also update this review as I spend a few more hours with this Chromebook.Thanks for Reading.Update 7/29/2014:  With a few more days under my belt, I really feel that the main benefit of the i3 chip in this Chromebook is multitasking speed (and the 4GB helps there as well).  The thing just runs a lot smoother while you are opening and closing  new tabs.  Pages that used to make my music stutter while they were loading have no effect anymore.  I've kept videos playing while adding a tab to look up something else and the video doesn't stumble or lose it's audio sync.  The thinks I do with my Chromebook don't generally involve having a ton of things going at the same time, but when I do, everything just runs a whole lot better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXS2R1PAZN5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOUIZBC#wasThisHelpful","R2PXS2R1PAZN5J","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know I dont show up as a verified purchase, but I bought this amp from a factory authorized seller on EB (davidzhezhe).  My research revealed this was essential should I need warranty support if anything goes wrong.What a fantastic little amp!  Great sound and plenty of power!  It definitely needs a minimum 50 hours of burn-in before it really starts to open up, and even with the stock tubes the sound is very nice (more on that to follow).  Just remember that its recommended to turn it off every 4-6 hours and let it cool for at least 30 minutes.  You dont want to let this thing run unattended overnight, but with tubes you dont want to be turning it on and off all the time either.  Cold starts are where vacuum tubes are stressed the most.  If your going to listen for an hour, take a break, and then come back, its better just to leave the amp on.  I paired this amp with a Schiit Modi DAC and it was necessary to open it (Little Dot) up and set the gain switches to 10db so I could get the performance I needed with my high impedance phones and the low output of the Schiit.  Now I have plenty of power on tap.  If youre planning on using the amp with high sensitivity/ low impedance headphones its better to use a lower gain setting which will give you more accurate control with the volume pot.  Ive used this amp with my Sennheiser HD-600s and HD-598s, Beyerdynamics DT-880s (250 0hm), Audio Technica ATH-M50s, V-Moda Crossfade M-100s, Sony MDR-7506s and MDR-V6s, and even my Koss Porta Pros.  I use Google Play Music 320kbps MP3s as my primary source, and also CDs played with my Onkyo C-7030.  I would say that with either the MP3s or the CDs the HD-600s are my favorites with the Little Dot, and for closed phones I like pairing it with the MDR-7506s.The amp is built very well, and its the perfect size for my desk.  The included RCA cables are okay, but I picked up some better ones.  The RCA cable package also has 2 additional jumpers in case you lose one of the jumpers from inside the amp (used to switch things up for different tube families)  The power cable has also been mentioned as an issue for some people, but its easy to replace with any 3 prong cable like youd use with a computer tower or monitor.  The manual will get you started, but it is really poorly written and contains many grammatical and even operational errors.  The whole section on setting the gain switches is a disaster.  If you have questions in this area (or any area) please feel free to ask me in the comments.  The most up to date manual can be found at littledot (dot) net which is really a forum.  Just go to the Little Dot Models and Pricing area, choose the MK II section and then look for the dropbox pdf link at the bottom below the pictures.  And even that manual is wrong in the Recommendations section of the gain control table.  All the recommendations are essentially backwards.  For example: You want to use a gain setting of 10 for HIGH impedance/LOW sensitivity phones, not with LOW impedance/LOW sensitivity phones.  The sensitivity part is right, but the impedance part is backwards as high impedance cans (say 250 ohm and higher) generally need more power or a higher gain setting to play as well as phones in the 32 to 60 ohm range.  And dont use phones (or buds) below 32 ohms with this amp.Well sound is really what its all about, and the Little Dot MK2 ii doesnt disappoint.  The amp has an excellent noise floor (as does the Schiit) and I have had no humming or ground loop issues as some have mentioned.  Like I stated earlier, the sound was pretty decent with the stock tubes after about 50 hours of burn-in.  Nice and warm; and when combined with the glow of the tubes in a darkened room and some sweet jazz, just makes the whole listening experience that much better.  The amp also gave a noticeable improvement to the soundstage (especially with open phones) when compared to my Nuforce Icon DAC/amp.  I was a bit disappointed with the low end from the stock tubes, but this wasnt surprising based on the reviews I had read.  Remember though, tube rolling is all part of the fun in owning a tube amplifier, and the Little Dot is built for it.  I found a wonderful tube rolling guide on Head-Fi that pretty much runs the gamut of options for the Little Dot MK2 and 3.  Just search head-fi little dot tube rolling guide and youll find it.  I chose to stay in the EF95 family to start (the default jumper setting), and picked up some better power tubes (though I havent used them yet) and a couple sets of driver tubes (the smaller ones in front that really affect the sound).  The Mullard M8100s and Voshkod 6ZH1P-EV tubes that I purchased are both a noticeable improvement over the stock tubes in all essential areas, and you can hear the differences between the two of them as well.  Its pretty cool that you can mix and match tubes and headphones to find that just right combination that suits your listening tastes.  I still have a lot of combinations of tubes and phones to test, but thats what this hobby is all about.  I dont think Ive reached the end of my tube purchasing either.This is a really great amp and I am very happy with my purchase.  I personally dont see the need for anything more for myself, but this amp is also a great place to start for someone who wants to see what the whole tube amp world is all about.  Especially given the wide variety of tubes that are available for it all over the internet and the seemingly endless combinations one can experiment with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODQZRGIMWCG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2QMAI2#wasThisHelpful","R1ODQZRGIMWCG7","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have Porta Pros you'll need these sooner or later.  Easy to put on (turn inside out and roll on) and your PPs are as good as new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242N47XKT5D6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O2KIMO#wasThisHelpful","R242N47XKT5D6N","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I guess after owning a pair of these Porta Pros for over two decades now, I thought I would come here and write a quick review.  I live in Milwaukee (where the Koss Headquarters is located), and I believe I'm on my fourth (maybe fifth) pair of the Porta Pros, but I only ever paid for the first pair.  All of the replacements were courtesy of Koss (I actually still have my original receipt from Soundstage).  Some pairs just wore out and a couple were damaged out of carelessness, but Koss has always come through for me.  And of course, I have gone through LOTS of ear pads.  I'm listed as a verified purchaser on Amazon because I just ordered some of these for my son.  I am an admitted audiophile and I own a very nice assortment of headphones and amps, so when I praise these Porta Pros I am doing so from a quality and value standpoint.  Obviously these phones aren't going to keep up with high end pairs costing up into the hundreds of dollars, but the sound quality is excellent for what these little babies do cost (my son's pair was $30).  What's more, it wasn't until I started to get into the nicer cans that I really started to appreciate what these Porta Pros were capable of.To understand these phones, you have to understand the pop music (and hardware) from the decade in which they were designed.  Just like lots of  bass is all the rage in much of the current pop music; in the 80's it was treble.  Dolby processing was starting to become common on portable cassette players, and CD's were just starting to hit the market in mass.  Both formats now allowed for the ability to play back higher highs with improved clarity but without distortion and artist were really taking advantage of this.  Just go back and listen to 80's music that hasn't been re-mastered and you'll see what I'm talking about.  If you go to Headphone dot com's ""Build a Graph"" page and look at the graph for these Porta Pros, you'll see that they're tuned to bring up the low end while reducing the highs, thus providing a much flatter response from the players and recordings of the time.If you have an equalizer available in your system (computer, phone, etc) it is very easy to ""flatten"" the sound curve of these little Porta Pros, and the results are amazing.  Using the Koss Porta Pro graph on the ""Headphone"" Build a Graph page, viewed in the 15db dynamic range, I simply reduced and raised the available frequencies to flatten out the curve.  These are excellent starting settings and you can tweak for personal preference from here.  Just make small changes and sample a variety of your favorite tracks.  The numbers below are the frequency adjustment points from Windows Media Player, and they are almost identical to iTunes. If you're limited to maybe a 5 band EQ on your phone just adjust the frequencies available to you.  This really kills the volume in Goolge Play Music on my Nexus 5 which isn't all that loud in the first place, so I use an external amp and the sound is great.31Hz to +1 / 62Hz to -6 / 125Hz to -7 / 250Hz to -5 / 500Hz to -1 / 1KHz 0 / 2KHz to -1 / 4Khz to +5 / 8KHz to +3 / 16KHz to +9I now use the Porta Pros mainly at work in combination with my Nuforce uDAC-2 and it's an excellent pairing that gives a really impressive sound.  The soundstage the Porta Pros are capable of is pretty big as well.  If you want to experience this for yourself, just start playing a song (live music works well for this test) and then cover the outside of the phones with your hands.  You should hear the soundstage collapse significantly and then re-open when you take your hands away.  Obviously, the Porta Pros can't always keep up when recordings start getting louder and more complicated, but at the moderate to low levels I generally listen at any problems are much less apparent (and really almost unnoticeable).  And, they can still play pretty clean and loud when I feel like it.  Especially with the audio quality and power available from my little DAC/amp.What can I say about the styling?  When I got my first pair they weren't even cool anymore.  I think they would look a lot better if they dumped the blue parts and went with all black and steel.  The stainless steel band will catch your hair from time to time, but after you learn to put them on and off it isn't much of a problem.  The ""Comfort Zone"" adjustments really do work/help me, and like I said earlier, you should order some spare ear pads right away too.  If you wear these out in public enough you will definitely get some stares, but you may also meet some fellow Porta Pro enthusiasts.  I also noticed that the bag that came with my son's pair is a bit smaller than the old bags.  I get the feeling they've made it as small as possible to save money.  What it does is make it really hard to put the headphones in and out easily.All in all, these phones still sound as good as ever; and for people who buy these, sound is what matters.  If you can live with the styling and the loss of a few strands of hair, I don't think you'll find anything better at this price.  Save your receipt and you can always get a new pair if anything bad happens. Koss hit a winner 30 years ago, and I'm amazed that these are still so popular today, but really, once you hear them it'll all be clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UA4TU8KE4T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001P4ZH#wasThisHelpful","R1UA4TU8KE4T5","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simply put, this bag is an excellent value.  I use the bag with my Acer C720 Chromebook when I have to travel, and it's perfect because it has plenty of space for my charging brick and cords  There's also room for my Icon uDAC 3/headphone amp, my Koss PortaPros, and even a travel mouse.  The bag is made very well and while I don't feel it would offer serious protection from drops or things being knocked against it it is a great way to haul around my computer  I am extremely glad I didn't spend a lot of extra cash on a more ""name-brand"" bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BVT1QITUKMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUGZFA6#wasThisHelpful","R1BVT1QITUKMR","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this Schiit Modi to convert 320kbps MP3s from my Asus Chrome Box and output to my Little Dot MK2 ii headphone amp.  Works perfectly with Chrome OS, and I have also tried it with Windows 7 Pro where it has performed without issue.  I know they say its plug and play, but with Windows you will have to make it the default playback device, and you'll want to crank up the sample rate and bit depth on the devices properties.  I had been using my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone amp to feed the Little Dot, but I like that the Modi uses USB power and is just a simple in and out.  I am also very happy with the sound, as it suits my listening requirements perfectly.  I feel it is an excellent DAC for the money.  I did have to open up the Little Dot and increase the gain settings as the output from the Modi is a bit on the soft side compared to my Nuforce, but looking at the specs prior to purchase I had expected that.  I also wish the shipping from Schiit was a bit quicker, but that's really my only complaint.  All in all, and excellent product that I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGG501DXOCTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CICPN0K#wasThisHelpful","R1EGG501DXOCTB","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a Chrome OS/Chromebook user for over a year now, and in that time I went from one Samsung Series 3 Chromebook to owning 5 Chromebooks and a Chromebox.  I have the Samsung, the HP-11, an Acer C720 4GB (with upgraded 128GB SSD), a C720 2GB, and the Toshiba 13.  I also have the Asus Chromebox Haswell with upgraded memory and SSD.  All of my Chrome OS devices have served flawlessly and they all get plenty of use in our house.  I purchased this LG Chromebase for my wife to use, but I have spent a fair amount of time with it as well.  I also purchased a Chromebase for my in-laws to replace a 9 year-old Toshiba laptop they had been using.  The LG Chromebase is an excellent example of a Chrome OS device, though there is room for improvement.  It really represents a great value (in my opinion), and its the perfect computer for someone whos just wants to surf and email, and is always calling you for technical support.  However, If you want more flexibility, something in black (which I thought LG was going to offer in the US), or the ability to upgrade RAM and SSDs, the Asus Chromebox, along with the monitor of your choice, is probably a better pick.  The Chromebase cost me $329 while the Chromebox, monitor, cable, keyboard, mouse, and speakers came to just over $400.  The memory and SSD upgrade I did to the Chromebox added another $150, but prior to that upgrade the Chromebox and Chromebase had the same basic specs.SCREEN:  Like a Chromebook, this Chromebase is tied to its screen so of course, the quality of that screen is very important.  While the IPS screen is more than adequate with good color and brightness, it isnt a class leader by any means.  I have an Asus 23 IPS screen set up with my Chromebox and it beats the Chromebase screen in really every regard.  Its brighter,  has better colors, and has much better contrast.  And, I can easily upgrade it if I choose to do so.  Still, as part of this easy all in one package, the LG Chromebase screen gets the job done just fine.  It took about 5 minutes to assemble the base to it using the 6 phillips head screws.  What people also need to realize is that the monitor has its own settings that are controlled by the touch buttons on the front.  Its not like the screens in the Chromebooks that have no adjustments (aside from resolution).  I suggest taking the time to play with the settings if you buy one of these.  The Reader button on the monitor is nice allowing you to quickly drop the brightness to preset levels, and the Chrome button makes it easy to switch sources from the Chrome system to the external HDMI input.  The built in speakers work well too; just remember to turn up the volume on the front of the monitor itself or you wont get enough volume (as some reviewers have complained about).  To do this you just touch on the left and right arrows of the monitor (when the menu is not up)COMPUTER:  The performance of the computer is as good as any of the Haswell Chromebooks and Chromeboxes Ive used.  Its disappointing that you cant easily upgrade the SSD or the memory, but with the lean Chrome OS and the low cost of online storage neither of these is an issue (and everyone should learn how to work in the cloud).  I have not had any problems with the WiFi, and the Bluetooth works good too.  Its nice that it has a built in port for wired operation as well.  I was disappointed that the Chromebase didnt include a built-in card reader, but with 4 USB ports you can always add an external drive or a card reader.  If you have a newer digital camera, you can connect it directly to the Chromebase and it will automatically upload your photos to your Google Drive for you.  It will do the same if you have a phone as well.  It searches for the DCIM folder on your device, and if that folder has media files like pictures and videos it will save them automatically.  Another nice feature is the HDMI port that allows you to connect a second HDMI source to the monitor.  I havent used it, but I have read other reviews that were quite happy with this capability.  When I logged into my Google account with the Chromebase it automatically set itself up to work with my cloud printer, and the Chromebase also works well with my external DAC/headphone amp, just like all the other Chrome OS devices I own.KEYBOARD AND MOUSE:  The included keyboard and mouse are adequate, but they are cheap.  One of my favorite island style keyboards is the one on my HP Chromebook 11.  The keys are good sized, have a good feel, decent travel with a nice snap to them while still being incredibly quiet, The Chromebase keyboard is a good size for my hands, but its only other positive quality is that it has the built in Chrome OS buttons.  I chose to purchase a Samsung Chrome keyboard to use with my Asus Chromebox, and it isnt all that great either. It would be nice if someone came out with a nice Chrome keyboard now that there are several devices on the market that would benefit from one.  You can use a wired or wireless standard keyboard if you want, you just have to relabel (or reassociate in your brain) the F-buttons for the chrome functions.  The mouse tracks just fine, but it is really cheap and light and it is lacking a few functions.  You get far more features and capabilities with a Chromebook touchpad than with the Chromebase mouse.  At least the Logitech mouse I bought for my Chromebox has a wheel that can tilt left and right to page back or forward. But it would be nice to have a button on the mouse that could launch the Chrome app switcher (the button on the keyboard that has a rectangle followed by 2 lines).  I know another user had mentioned swapping the LG mouse and keyboard for Apple products, but he didnt speak to any added functionality.SUMMARY:  I am rating this product 5 Stars for its quality (so-so mouse and keyboard aside) value, and simplicity.  My wife really enjoys her Chromebase, but I think my in-laws like theirs even more.  Their old computer had been so bad for so long, they had no idea how much computing had changed over the past 5 or 6 years.  They especially like the speed and screen quality/size (and they LOVE Hangouts calls and Spotify).  I like the fact that aside from answering the occasional Chrome OS operational question I dont have to provide constant IT support for system problems (virus/malware/spyware software, java updates, plug-ins, updates that install 50 other programs, clicking on links that hijack your browser, and the list goes on).  If you want a Chrome OS device for home use only, arent interested in upgrading the internals (which are very capable for most users), are okay with the white color, and you dont want to have to deal with finding the right screen, mouse, and keyboard this is the machine for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MLG39278624K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR625WO#wasThisHelpful","R1MLG39278624K","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice cable, and the perfect length to connect my DAC to my Little Dot Amp.

"I would like to preface my review of these headphones with the following:  Everybody hears differently, and everyone listens differently.  We dont all enjoy the same types of music, and similarly, every set of headphones is not necessarily suited for every genre of music.  We all own different source components, and most of us have a limit as to what we are willing to spend on our gear.  I believe every headphone review should include a brief summary of the reviewers musical tastes, sources, and gear and should always including references to other sets of cans they own, have auditioned, liked, or disliked.  With so many variables affecting peoples like or dislike of any pair of phones it is my goal to help those with similar musical tastes and similar gear to determine whether or not these headphones will be a good investment for them personally.So with that in mind; I listen to music in practically every genre.  I tend to go through different phases, but I enjoy Mozart as much as Metallica, 80s one hit wonders and New Orleans Jazz, Lady Antebellum or Lady Gaga, Eminem to Zedd.  Music has so much to offer in all genres that one could spend a lifetime discovering new things they like.  I use my computer to play all the usual manner of digital files, and an Onkyo C-7030 CD player to handle disk duty.  Both feed into my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  The digital files via USB and the CDs via analog RCA (the Onkyo has excellent onboard D/A conversion).  I use no equalizer to modify the sound.  I will also be receiving a Little Dot MK2 ii in the next couple days and I may update this review once its well broken in.  My headphones include Sony MDR-V6s and MDR-7506s, V-Moda Crossfade LPs and M-100s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, Sennheiser HD 598s and HD 600s (my personal favorite along with these 880s) as well as my 4th pair of Koss Porta-Pros (easy to exchange when you live in Milwaukee) .  Ive tried Grado SR 80s and SR 225s (just too darn uncomfortable), the Beyerdynamics DT 990 Pro 250 ohm, and my son even owns a pair of Beats Solo phones (Yuk).  The other day I threw away some old Denons (no clue what model, but circa 1990) and a set of MDR V600s that were both totally worn out.  I also own lots of buds as well (my Klipsh X10s and S4s being my favorites).As I briefly mentioned, I had tried the Beyerdynamics DT 990 Pro 250ohm headphones.  In fact, I had tried the 990s and returned them prior to purchasing the DT 880 Premium 250 ohm set.  The 990 Pros are very well built high quality headphones, I just wasnt happy with the exaggerated high and low ends and the subdued midrange. I blame myself for not doing enough research prior to that purchase (and for being cheap), and I would still recommend them to people who like that type of sound.  They really do sound good, but their signature just wasnt for me.Im much happier with the 880s having listened to them for a couple weeks now.  They have a much more up-front midrange, and while theyre still pretty bright, they dont have nearly as much sizzle as the 990s.  To my ears, the 880s sparkle a bit more than my Sennheiser HD 600s, but the Senns have more pronounced mids.  The bass seems well defined, though I wouldnt mind just the slightest bit more of it (and yes, Im nitpicking).  At first I was wanting for more middle from the 880s as well, but after a lot of listening and experimenting with different genres of music I know when to use them and when to use different cans.  The soundstage the 880s create is excellent as well.  Since Ive gotten into open headphones, and since Ive found several pairs that I really like, I find it incredibly difficult to throw on a set of closed cans anymore.  Im also amazed at how the 880s can sound so big but not leak as much sound as ALL of the other open headphones I own/have tried.  I dont want anyone thinking they dont leak sound; they just dont leak as much.  Like any other open phone, you need to be in a quiet environment to truly enjoy them, and everyone else in the room will hear what you're listening to.  The 880s power-handling is excellent and I really had to push them to create any type of distortion (Coldplays Magic will buzz the heck out of my Senn HD 598s well before these 880s or my HD 600s).  The 800s can handle complex musical sections without issue, and had no problems whatsoever with anything I threw at them.  They are a little less sensitive (db) to input than my HD 600s, but I have no problems driving them with my Nuforce Icon DAC.  I am also looking forward to seeing how the 880s (and all my phones) play with my soon to be arriving Little Dot MK2 ii.Another element that I have always felt is essential to a fulfilling headphone experience is comfort, and the DT 880 Premiums excel at it!  The 990s I had were the Pros, and they were a bit tight on my melon.  I cant speak from experience about the 880 Pros, but they do have a different headband (similar to the 990 Pros), and are designed to clamp tighter than the 880 Premiums.  It only takes a short time for my 880s to disappear on my head.  They do absolutely nothing in terms of discomfort, to take away from the listening experience.  As much as I enjoy my HD 650s, they still grab you tighter than the 880 Premiums.  If it werent for the 600s oval shape, as compared to the 880s round cups, I probably wouldnt be able to wear them (the 600s) for extended periods.  If you do a lot of moving around, however, you may want to consider the 880 Pros.  As comfortable as the Premiums are, I could easily sneeze them off of my head they clamp so lightly.  I like that the velour earcups are replaceable, I have no issue with the long straight cable, though I wish it was detachable, and I appreciate the 3.5 / 6.35 mm screw type plug.  The carry case that comes with the premiums is also a nice touch.All in all the Beyerdynamic DT 880 Premium 250 ohm headphones are an excellent set of cans.  Im proud to own them, and I highly recommend them.  My only advice to shoppers is that they research the Beyerdynamic line and understand the differences between Pro and Premium, the 32, 250, and 600 ohm impedances, and the unique sound signatures of the different models.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BE8PRP0UMOMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B1QENY#wasThisHelpful","R2BE8PRP0UMOMY","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would like to preface my review of these headphones with the following:  Everybody hears differently, and everyone ""listens"" differently.  We don't all enjoy the same types of music, and similarly, every set of headphones is not necessarily suited for every genre of music.  We all own different source components, and most of us have a limit as to what we are willing to spend on our gear.  I believe every headphone review should include a brief summary of the reviewer's musical tastes, sources, and gear and should always including references to other sets of cans they own, have auditioned, liked, or disliked.  With so many variables affecting peoples like or dislike of any pair of phones it is my goal to help those with similar musical tastes and similar gear to determine whether or not these headphones will be a good investment for them personally.To that end; I listen to music in practically every genre.  I tend to go through different phases, but I enjoy Mozart as much as Metallica, 80's one hit wonders and New Orleans Jazz, Lady Antebellum or Lady Gaga, Eminem to Zedd.  Music has so much to offer in all genres that one could spend a lifetime discovering new things they like.  I use my computer to play all the usual manner of digital files, and an Onkyo C-7030 CD player to handle disk duty.  Both feed into my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  The digital files via USB and the CDs via analog RCA (the Onkyo has excellent onboard D/A conversion).  I use no equalizer to modify the sound.  My headphones include Sony MDR-V6s and MDR-7506s, V-Moda Crossfade LPs and M-100s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, Sennheiser HD 598s and HD 600s (my personal favorite) as well as my 4th pair of Koss Porta-Pros (easy to exchange when you live in Milwaukee) .  I've tried Grado SR 80s and SR 225s (just too darn uncomfortable), and my son even owns a pair of Beats Solo phones (Yuk).  The other day I threw away some Denon's (no clue what model, but circa 1990) and a set of MDR V600s that were both totally worn out.  I also own lots of buds as well (my Klipsh X10s being my favorite).So what do I think of these DT 990 Pro 250s? In short, and for my personal tastes , I think they're just okay.  Let me put it another way.  When I got my Sennheiser HD 600s I plugged them in, fired up Chris Isaac's ""Wicked Game"" and in less than 30 seconds had a chill running up my spine.  I spent many, many hours with those 600s over the next couple days tearing through my music collection like a kid in a candy store who'd just gotten his first taste of sugar.  With the 990's I spent a lot of hours listening and a lot of hours feeding white, pink, brown, etc. noise in hopes that the middle range would open up and the dynamics would improve, but any change was negligible.  Do I think the 990's are bad headphones with terrible sound?  Not at all.  I spent many years listening to music  with my EQ looking like a couple of deep V's, making for accentuated treble and bass and a subdued midrange.  But as I stated earlier, I now use no equalization in my system and have really come to appreciate a more flat and balanced presentation.  I've also come to prefer the sound of open phones to closed cans.  For $140 these are an excellent way to get into a pair of high quality open phones, especially if you're looking for those boosted lows and highs.  They clamped a little tight and the pads were a bit stiff when I first put them on, but they have become very comfortable over the past week and a half.  They are made very well and being able to replace any broken or worn part is a big benefit.  I like the coiled cable and the plug with the screw-on "" adapter (though I wish it was detachable), and I think the phones are nicely styled.  I wish the midrange had a bit more presence and that the phones had better dynamics (difficult with the subdued middle).  The soundstage is very good, though it doesn't feel quite as wide as my HD 598s or 600's (at least to my ears).  All in all the DT 990's are very good cans; they just aren't for me.  Still I debated for quite a while as to whether or not I would keep them.  But, in the end I decided I would send them back.UPDATE:  I didn't want to give up on Beyerdynamics, so the day after I returned these 990s I ordered a set of DT-880 Premiums.  I'm hoping that the sound will be more what I like, and based on most of the professional reviews I have read I think they may be.  I admit I was being cheap when I chose the 990 Pros over the 880s.  Not that the 990s are cheap in any way other than price, or that they aren't an excellent value (probably one of the best in the world of headphones).  I will add to this update when I've had a chance to audition the 880s, and I will be sure to review those as well.FINAL UPDATE:  So I got the DT 880s (250 ohm Premium) today, and I knew right away that I liked them.  Much more in line with my personal preferences.  Still a tiny bit of sizzle on the top, but the mids are much more ""up-front"".  The bass is very detailed, but also less pronounced than the 990s.  The 880 Premiums clamp A LOT lighter than the 990 Pros as well (super comfortable, though I could probably sneeze them off).  In the end, I was glad I auditioned both sets, and even though the 880s are almost double what I got the 990's for I will be keeping them.  I can see the appeal of the 990s, but still, for me they were just okay (and I'm talking sound wise only).  Beyerdynamics makes some really nice cans, but a person needs to do their research to figure out which model will suit them best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCS1DL0JXNURC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011UB9CQ#wasThisHelpful","RCS1DL0JXNURC","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't travel with my Sennheiser HD 650s all that much, but I did want a case I could store them in at home without having to constantly remove the cables.  This case fits the bill, and because of it's shape I can also leave my earcups extended (even then the phones still do slide around a bit).  I put the phones in with the cables pointing to one of the corners and there is hardly any pressure on the wires (see customer photos).  The build quality is okay, it's sewn well, and the zippers are smooth, but I wish it had the quality of the CASEBUDi cases as well as their carrying strap.  The case just seems a bit expensive for what you're getting.  And, aside from keeping everything organized and protected from the elements and some short drops, don't expect that you could sit, step. or pile a lot of weight on this thing and it wouldn't get crushed; it's not that solid.  It was packaged nicely inside a bubble wrap bag within a cardboard box and arrived in perfect condition.  All in all a decent case, but a bit expensive. lacking a carry strap, and not all that strong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQV0YOX26BOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVFRYHM#wasThisHelpful","RHQV0YOX26BOT","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would seem that my review has turned out to be a sort of comparison of the Sennheiser HD 598s to the HD 600s.  While it wasn't where I intended to go, I think the comparison is valid when deciding if the $200 premium is worth the payout (it is).I have owned/auditioned a ton of headphones over the years, and I currently have a pretty decent assortment in my stable.  But these HD 600s are probably going to have all those other pairs collecting dust.  About a month ago I had purchased a pair of HD 598s and they were the pair of cans that finally sold me on open phones.  I really like the 598s, and they are excellent for classical, jazz, classic rock, and many other genres music.  However, when it came to listening to contemporary popular music they just seemed to come up short.  The HD 600s are a much better ""all around"" headphone, and well worth the additional $200 (in my opinion).  Their superiority was evident from the moment I put them on and plugged them in.  I played Chris Isaac's ""Wicked Game"" and I literally had a chill run up my spine.  More bass than the 598s?  Yes; but it's not unnatural in any way whatsoever.  It just adds to the richness/quality of the overall sound.  These make everything just sound more real, and they seem to do it almost effortlessly.  After listening to the 600s for an extended period and then going back to the 598's, the differences become more noticeable.  Again,  where the 598s start to struggle, the 600s just power through.  I completely understand why so many people consider these to be some of the best phones ever produced.  I have also been tricked into looking around the room for that noise I just heard only to realize it was part of the recording.  If you need to stick to a budget, the 598s are an excellent choice and a fantastic bargain (just watch and wait for the price to dip).  However, if you can afford the premium price, the HD 600s are worth every penny.My listening setup consists of a variety of digital files played from my computer, an Onkyo C-7030 CD player, and a Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  I should also add that I don't use any equalization with my phones.  I messed around running the phones directly off the computer's headphone jack, and I have to say that I highly recommend a good DAC/Amp to get the most out of these cans, as the added power really brings them to life.  And remember that to truly ""Listen"" to these phones you need to be in a quiet environment.A few other observations:  The 600's clamp quite a bit tighter than the 598s, though they do seem to be loosening up a bit with use.  I think the 598s actually sound a bit wider and a touch brighter, but my 600's only have about 15 hours on them at this writing and like the 598s, I expect them to open up after more time.  I may invest in a better cable in the future, but the included cable gets the job done, and it's more flexible than the one for the 598's (which I also replaced).  I had thought about comparing these to some of my other closed phones for my review, but really, I don't feel that any of them even comes close to these 600s. I've also noticed that with the 598's it is important to find that sweet spot in the volume where the sound really starts to shine, while the 600's play much better and more balanced over a wider range of volume (high and low).I am looking forward to enjoying these headphones for many years to come.  If you have any comments or questions I welcome them and will try my best to answer.  I did extensive research prior to this purchase, so if I can't answer a specific question I may be able to point you in the right direction.Update 1:  After probably 20 more hours of listening I can clarify my comment about the 598s being a little bit brighter.  On certain pieces when I hear a high-hat cymbal on the 598's, I hear it as one sound, and mostly the sound of the cymbal.  On the 600's you clearly hear the stick hitting the cymbal, and the sound of the cymbal itself.  So, I would say the high end of the 600s may not be perceived as being as bright as the 598's, but it is much more defined, clear, and controlled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FIJMRCVGR11T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SY4H#wasThisHelpful","R1FIJMRCVGR11T","A4GGT6O0GQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GGT6O0GQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 pairs of these, 1 I use and 2 in reserve.  They have excellent sound and the take well to equalization.  If you like thumping bass and clear highs these are the ticket.  If you like jazz, classical, etc, you can easily dial down the bass and adjust the middle and top a bit for more ""flat"" listening.  They have a high SPL rating so they'll play loud with not so powerful sources, and the bass will having you looking around for the subwoofer.  I can drive these to incredible levels with my Nuforce uDAC 2 and they play loud and clear.  I could take or leave the uneven cable lengths.  The added carry case comes in handy, and if you take care of these they will last a long time.

Good in that the printer was affordable, and bad because Canon ink is so expensive.

The swivel is convenient and it's really easy to hang and remove the bag. However sometimes it can be too easy to remove the bag.

"We've only had this a few days but so far we're loving it. I never knew you could have so much fun with a toaster... I had seen this originally while looking for a new toaster but passed it by because the name made it sound like it wasn't also a normal toaster. However a friend randomly mentioned wanting this toaster and it made me take a closer look. It does everything I wanted in a normal toaster. It has a defrost feature, it lifts the toast really high so it's easy to pull out and has a bagel setting.The egg component is just a fun bonus. All weekend long we've been making breakfast sandwiches and our kids love them too. The unit comes with a little measuring cup that tells you the amount of water to use depending on what type of eggs you want. You pour that in and then crack the eggs into the compartments. The measuring cup has a point on the bottom so that you can easily break the yokes. When you select the toast and egg dual setting it will wait to start toasting until the eggs coordinate to be done at the same time as whatever doneness you want your toast. This way everything is nice and hot. You can warm the meat at the same time too, though for many of our sandwiches we made fresh bacon in a pan. The egg comes out hot enough to melt a piece of cheese.My only disappointment was that the toaster couldn't handle a small croissant, since I prefer those with my breakfast sandwiches to English muffins. The first one came out burnt to a crisp. Once we realized it was burning there was no way to stop it since it was toasting at the same time as the eggs. I tried then toasting separately at a lower setting and this time it got stuck and mangled. So not great for croissants but it's not billed as such anyway. I haven't tried making soft or hard boiled eggs yet but I'm excited to try that setting next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMT4W1HT8C0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LTIYN2#wasThisHelpful","R3QMT4W1HT8C0M","A2Y1R0BTSW56LZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y1R0BTSW56LZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I typically use a CBTL single cup maker which offers espresso pods. While I enjoy the convenience it provides and the coffee is pretty good considering sometimes I do crave a more authentic full blown taste or simply want to make more than what a pod outputs.

I love that with this unit we can make up to 6 cups and it's actually much faster than I expected. The coffee it makes is good and obviously dependent largely on the bean and quantity used.

"I had a previous blanket by JJ Cole that I had since lost. I loved the look and quality of the blanket, however that one I had to fold up and try to fit inside some straps. It was a pain and the blanket would fall out of the straps so it wasn't the best design. This blanket is majorly improved. The bag shown on top of the blanket in the picture isn't a separate bag, it's what the blanket looks like when it's folded up. It's super obvious how to fold the blanket and then it just velcros shut into what looks like a small bag. It's incredibly easy to do and then it can be carried like a purse on my arm. I like the look of this blanket as well and I love the material. It's thick enough that grass and sticks don't poke through and it's really comfortable. It's easy to wipe clean with a wet rag. My only complaint is I wish it were bigger. I may just purchase a second because it's not big enough for my whole family.

"I've often tried to do an at home mani to save time and money from going to the nail salon but mine never turns out the same. I've realized that a big part of that is because I don't remove the cuticles the same. I've used a stick to push them back but then it's just kind of a thick lump. I was excited when I saw these because it seemed like it would get a better manicure by actually removing the excess cuticle rather than shoving it back. It took me a little bit to master it because at first I was nervous about ripping my skin. I managed to do it without bleeding and it looked good so I'll call that a win.

"We've had an Aeropress for several years and have been very happy with the coffee it makes. Since we find even doing the ""4 cup"" setting it really only makes enough for one person so between my husband and myself we go through at least 2 disposable filters a day. The packs are large so they do last quite awhile however it seemed like a nice idea to have a reusable one since the cost does add up over the years. My biggest concern was that it would somehow alter or affect the taste of the coffee and thankfully I haven't found that to be the case. It works well and we're happy with these new filters. It's slightly more work since it's another part to wash and keep track of, we seem to always be losing small parts. But overall I think it's worth it for the savings that would accumulate over time.

"This is a great starter kit if you can find it locally and get it at a good price.  I was able to do both, and I am really happy with the purchase.The terrarium itself is well made, and the top works very well.  It slides in and out, and has a small attachment that makes it so that your crabs won't be able to get out of it.It comes with some substrate, but you'll probably want to get a bit more for keeping your hermit crabs adequately.  It's got two bowls for water, and the conditioner to have the water dechlorinated and one to turn it into salt water.It's got food, and some treats.Is absolutely everything you need to raise healthy hermit crabs included?  No.  You'll need lights, thermometer/hygrometer, some more substrate, and another bowl...but it's a darn good start.I notice that most of the reviews that are negative involve the terrarium arriving damaged.

"I purchased a Prism Isotope on a recent trip to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  I've had experience with all types of kites, but the Isotope is a style I've never flown before...it's kind of a hybrid box and diamond kite.The kite goes together easily, comes with a really nice set of line on a really nice winder, and comes packaged in a very nice kite bag.  I also really like the giant tail that comes with the kite.I put the kite up in the air the day I got it, and it was a pretty steady 15 MPH wind.It flew wonderfully.  It climbed steadily, had a nice amount of pull, and looks AMAZING in the sky.  The tail flutters in the wind while the kite stays locked in place.  I really can't describe how great the kite looks in the air.I let all 300 feet of the line out, and the kite is so large that it's still easily seen in the sky.  I flew the kite for about 90 minutes before starting to slowly reel it back in.  The kite pulls so hard, and there is so much line, that brining it back in took me about another 30 minutes!!  Good stuff!!This kite looked so great in the air that I had several other people on the beach tell me that they had actually stopped by a shop and bought a kite after seeing mine in the air so that they could fly one themselves.Overall, I'm VERY happy with the Prism Isotope...and when the wind picks up here in Michigan, I'll be putting this up in the air as much as I can!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38J4UDLAYPCYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXLK3EI#wasThisHelpful","R38J4UDLAYPCYY","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a Prism EO6 on a recent vacation to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.I'm an experienced kite flyer...dual lines, single lines, quad lines...however, I'd never actually flown a box kite before.  I thought the EO6 looked like a cool option, and I've had experience with the Prism brand before.I took the EO6 out the day after I got it, in probably about 8MPH winds.  After a few launches, I was able to get it up into the air...and man, what a cool kite.It looks amazing floating in the wind above you, and really generates some looks from the other beach goers.  I was able to get the kite all the way out on it's line without crashing it, and it flew steadily and gracefully for about an hour, before I reeled it back in.The winder that comes with the kite is a nice one...it's much better than many of the handles with line on them that come with some other kites.I also like how the kite folds down and stores easily with a few pieces of elastic.  Good stuff.Overall, I really like the kite, and I'll for sure be flying it more in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AH8UZKI5BHLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XA25TQ#wasThisHelpful","R1AH8UZKI5BHLZ","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased my Galaxy Seeker from a local specialty toy store.  I like the guys that work there, and they were quick to praise the other Odyssey Toys line of quadcopters, so I took a chance on this one for flying around the yard.I've been very happy with this quadcopter.Earlier this summer I sold my DJI Phantom because I was getting tired of being bothered by people while I was using it about who or what I was ""spying"" on with my ""drone.""  It got old, quick, to the point where I didn't even want to take it out and fly it.I did like flying quads, though, so when I found the Galaxy Seeker at the store, I quickly took a liking to it.Lets get this right out of the way, this is a rebrand of a quad with a different name...it seems to be a licensed rebrand, but you can look around and possibly find the ""original"" for a bit less money than what Odyssey is selling it for.  That said, Odyssey is a company based in the United States, and they have actual humans that answer the phone when you call them...which is good.  You can get parts from them if you break anything, and they seemed to me to be a good group of people.  The small toy store I buy from prides itself on only selling good products, and the owner was impressed enough with Odyssey to carry the stuff in his store, so I trust that Odyssey is working hard to keep customers happy with good products.There are a couple of other things that should be noted about the product, as they differ from what's on the box.The most notable are two fold.1.  The box says that this quad features an HD camera, yet I have found that I can only display videos from it in 640x480 resolution, which is fine for the included monitor, but it's far from HD2.  The box says that the system runs on a 5.8ghz system, but I've found that it actually runs on 2.4ghz.  This won't mean a lot for a lot of people, but for serious users (hobbyists) it means the range on the FPV system will be a little bit limited.For me, I have not found either of these to be an issue, really, so I'm not letting it impact the score of the quad...however, they do need to be noted, as they are being misrepresented on the box.Finally, for my last negative...the manual leaves a bit to be desired.  There are a few features mentioned that it doesn't really explain how to use...I was able to figure them out by some trial and error, but I'd like to see a manual that actually tells you how to use all of the features.Now, I know that this seems like a lot of negatives...but, they really don't detract, to me, from the fun that this quad has provided me.Let's move on to the good!!!First off, the packaging looks very nice.  It's a good quality cardboard with a front that ""flips open"" to reveal the contents of the package through a clear plastic window.Upon opening the package, I was impressed with the look of the quad.  The black and red looks are sharp, and I'm a big fan of the ""fin"" on the back of it...it makes it look like a spaceship to me, which I like.  For the record, I'm an experienced RC pilot, so I am not using the blade guards...it saves a bit of weight, and I feel it looks better without them, however, they are included so you can add them if you need to.The quad body is made out of a lightweight, but strong feeling, plastic.  It almost feels like a kind of Lexan.  It feels like it has a ""bend but don't break"" kind of build, so I'm guessing that a hard crash would cause the plastic to bend but not actually break anything.  The landing legs are made out of the same material, and I've had a couple of rough landings, but nothing has been damaged.  Finally, the graphics on the body are actually painted on...they aren't stickers or decals, so that's a good quality touch.The camera that is included clips onto the bottom of the quad, then plugs into it.  I found it a bit difficult to get it clipped on the first time, but since I've gotten it on the first time, I've had no issues getting it on again and again.  A quick note about the camera...the manual mentions that you need to put the Micro SD card in the monitor for recording, but this is incorrect.  You can put the SD card in to VIEW the things you've recorded on the monitor, but in order to control the camera, you will need the SD card in the camera.  This is one of those ""errors"" in the manual that I was mentioning.The included transmitter is basic, but it gets the job done.  It feels good in the hand, has all of the necessary controls, and the top actually has a spot to mount the included 4.3"" monitor for viewing the FPV from the quad's onboard camera.  With the monitor installed, the whole thing feels a bit heavier than I'm used to, but that's to be expected, as I'm not used to having a monitor on my transmitter.  The monitor can be taken off of the transmitter, so you could have someone else watch that while you watch the quad.The transmitter uses 4 AA batteries, and the quad uses one 3.7v (1s) 700mah LiPo battery.  The charger included for the LiPo plugs into a USB port, and seems to charge the battery in about an hour.  The good news about the battery is it seems to be a fairly standard size, so a bit of looking around should net you some inexpensive extra batteries.The quad flies really well.  It's pretty fast in it's ""fast"" setting, and nice, slow, and stable in it's normal setting.  I've flown the quad in 15 MPH winds and had it survive just fine.  It's a bit of a handful in that kind of wind, but it can handle it.  In low winds, it flies like a dream.I really like flying the quad.  It's easy to control, nice and light so if you do happen to crash it in the grass it's not going to end up getting damaged.  It has a ""flip"" function built into the transmitter that works very well.  I would actually kind of classify this as a mild ""sport"" quad due to it's speed in the faster setting...it's really quick, and it can cover quite a bit of ground fairly quickly.The FPV function works really well.  This is my first real experience with ""real time"" FPV, and I've been really happy with it.  The frame rate drops as the range increases, but it works well out to about 50 meters, more if you seem to be in the right place at the right time.  Flying FPV is certainly a different experience...it's strange.  I found that at first I made sure that while flying while looking at the monitor, I still made sure that I could see the quad in my peripheral vision, which helped me to make sure it wasn't going to crash, or fly into a car, or something.The only thing wrong with the whole FPV system is the monitor doesn't have a sunscreen on it.  This doesn't really bother me, as I typically fly while standing in the shad anyway, but for someone that has to fly in the sun, it might be a good idea to create a shade for the screen.I've been impressed by the battery life on the quad, as well.  It will fly on it's tiny little battery for a good 7-8 minutes in relatively calm wind...less in higher winds, more in completely still wind.  You can fly even longer if you take the camera off and just fly while watching the quad.The motors in the quad were one thing I worried about, seeing as they're just tiny brushed motors...however, after quite a few flights they are still holding up just fine, so I think that their slightly larger size (they're 8.5mm where a lot of small quads use 7mm motors) is helping to take some of the strain off of them even though the quad is a bit heavier than other small quads.So far, I've really enjoyed the Galaxy Seeker.  It's fun to fly, which is the most important thing about a product like this.  The FPV works very well, also, which was a major selling point of the quad for me.  I, personally, even enjoyed trying to figure out how to get those features that I wasn't sure how to work.If you are looking for a good first quad to try FPV, I think the Galaxy Seeker would make a good choice for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4YBTQHGVDL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LFF33I#wasThisHelpful","R1J4YBTQHGVDL0","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good indoor quadcopter.It's very unique looking, it looks like the Helicarrier from the Marvel Movies, which is very cool.  It's got a LOT of lights on it, and it's very easy to see even in the dark.It's large, at over two feet long, and this size ends up causing it to move fairly slowly.  I didn't mind that it was slow, because I felt it gave it a ""scale"" look compared to the Helicarriers from the movies.  Some people might not like the slow speeds, however, so keep in mind that this is in no way a ""fast"" quad.The controller feels good in the hands, works well, but is very basic.  For this quad, that made no difference to me...I just wanted to be able to fly it.This quadcopter makes a great indoor flyer, and it CAN fly outdoors...however, you must do so in VERY little wind.  It's large body tends to be fairly susceptible to wind blowing it around and causing it to not fly very well.  In still conditions, though, it works just fine.Overall, I'm happy with this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PHK4UBV80KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7HESCU#wasThisHelpful","R7PHK4UBV80KB","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stikbot Studio is fun.  I'm absolutely terrible at it, but it's fun...and with a LOT of practice and experience, I'm guessing that anyone could make a pretty serviceable stop motion animated film with these characters.The Stikbots themselves are wonderful.  They are put together well, easy to pose, and the suction cups on their limbs work well to hook them onto things for you to film them in various different poses.The included ""tripod"" isn't the greatest quality, but it works.  I find it works best if you use a timer on your camera app, which then makes it so that the phone isn't moving at all from being touched when the photo is being taken.  The free app that you can use for this product, which I am using on iPhone 6, has the ability to set a timer from 1-10 seconds.  I've found that setting it for 5 seconds gives you time to touch the phone while it's on the tripod, let the tripod and phone ""settle"" from the vibrations from you touching the screen, and then take the image with the camera still, so the images come out clean and clear.I actually bought this product to ""animate"" a character that I'm creating for a class.  I can't draw to save my life, and the class only requires the ""concept"" of the character to be brought to life.  Ultimately, I will be using one of the Stikbots to represent my character, and the other to represent his ""enemy,"" and I will be making a short animation of them fighting for the class.I think it will turn out really well, as the stuff I've made with the product already has been solid...if not very imaginative.I like the product, and am having fun with it.  The characters are great, the app works well, and the tripod is serviceable.  I recommend this to anyone that is on the fence about buying it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIT3YW51CGRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VNB560#wasThisHelpful","R1HIT3YW51CGRB","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first real balaclava, and I have to say I'm really impressed by it.It fits me well...and I've got a pretty big head.It's comfortable, easy to get on and take off, fits you multiple different ways, and can easily be smashed down and stored in a pocket of your jacket when you're not using it.I love the material it's made out of it.  It's one of those ""high tech"" fabrics that somehow breathes while remaining warm, yet doesn't make you too hot when it's actually warm out and you're using it in the sun.  It also wicks sweat away from your skin which helps to keep you nice and cool.I've been using it for several things while testing it out this summer.  Under my motorcycle helmet it's nice because it wicks the sweat away from my head and helps to keep me cool.  When I take it off after taking my helmet off, the balaclava is moist, but my head is less sweaty than normal, and the liner of my helmet seems to be less ""moist.""  I believe that this is because the balaclava is basically retaining most of the moisture, which is awesome.The other thing I've been doing is wearing it as a facemask while working on some landscaping projects around my house.  These projects have ended up being VERY dusty, and I was finding myself coughing quite a bit while working on them.  With the balaclava on, I'm able to easily breath yet it doesn't cause me to feel like I'm lacking any oxygen...basically, the air flows through, the dust and dirt does not.  Very cool.Overall, I'm really happy with this product, and I can't wait to get it on during the winter when it's time to snowblow.

"I've been using the money belt when riding my motorcycle for the last couple of weeks.I couldn't be happier with this product for that purpose.When I used to ride with my wallet and my phone in my pockets, I was constantly reaching down to make sure that they hadn't fallen out.  I'm not sure what I would have done had I reached down and realized that they HAD in fact fallen out...I mean, it's not like I'm really going to be able to suddenly stop and instantly find them.Anyway, now that I've got this belt, I just toss it on underneath my jacket and throw my stuff inside it.  When I zip up my jacket, I'm superbly confident that the items aren't going to end up being lost, and I don't have to worry about reaching down to check my pockets.As stated, I'm wearing the belt over my clothes, however, for even more secrecy (or maybe when traveling) you could wear this under your shirt and it would be very comfortable and easily concealed.The belt is well made, has two different pockets, nice zippers, and a nice plastic side release buckle to make sure that it stays in place.The best part of this package is that it comes with two belts, so you can use one until it starts to wear out from use, then swap it out for the new one and keep right on going.Overall, I'm very happy with this money belt, and I've found it to be a real pleasure for when I'm riding my motorcycle.Recommended.***I was given a sample to review for a discounted price, however, I was not compensated for the review in any way and the opinions are true and accurate***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVEA73EQMCYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122MP3KU#wasThisHelpful","R2YVEA73EQMCYK","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to use as a utility belt for a Captain America costume I'm working on.The belt is made well, looks nice, has good stitching, nice hardware, and fits a wide range of waist sizes.  It's easy to adjust, the buckle works well and is nice and strong, and each pocket opens and closes easily.I needed it to be a darker brown for my use, so I dyed it with RIT dye.  It took the dye pretty well, but if you are planning on doing this, I would recommend washing the belt first with some soap and water...it seems to have just a tiny bit of water resistant coating put on it.  After rubbing the belt down, it took the dye a lot better than when I just dipped it in the dye.I'll attach some photos of it in the darker brown to show how it turned out.Overall, if you're looking for this type of belt, this one is a good choice.

"I love this external battery.I've been testing it for a few weeks now, and I can honestly say that it's the best external battery that I've ever used.  It charges devices at both 2.1 amp and 1 amp, depending on the needs of your device.  Obviously the 2.1 amp setting will charge the items faster if your item can accept the higher charge rate.The screen on the device is really nice.  It shows you the percentage of charge left in the battery itself, the voltage output, and the amperage output.  Being able to see how much ""juice"" is left in the battery at any given time is really valuable.  You know if you should worry about charging it, or if you can get by with waiting and using it one more time.It holds it's charge well, also.  After using it several times, I fully charged it and depleted the battery to 86%.  It stayed at 86% for over a week without dropping at all, and based on my use of it after doing this, the 86% was accurate as I was able to use the battery to charge devices just as much as before letting it sit.The battery also has a flashlight on it, which is a nifty feature that can come in handy.What I have been mainly using this battery for is charging my iPhone 6 while I sleep.  My phone's charger in my bedroom is nowhere near the bed, so I can't reach the phone to use the alarm clock.  This battery allows me to leave the phone on my nightstand and charge it, then during the day I recharge the backup battery when it needs it.  It's working like a charm.I also wanted to take a quick moment to note how nice the product looks.  It's minimalistic in design, yet very pleasing on the eyes.  It's not just some ugly box that you're connecting to your phone...it looks like a nice product.Overall, I highly recommend this.***EDIT***I was provided a sample product for a review.

"My wife got me a Rover 2.0 for Christmas this past year.I'm a big RC fan, and I also like things that take pictures and videos.  The Rover 2.0, she thought, would be right up my alley.She was right.I tore into the box before even finishing opening my other gifts.  I loved this thing right off the bat.I got it all set to go and set about on a mission to get some footage of the elusive Presto...the black cat that lives in my house.Controlling the Rover was simple with the app on my iPad.  I feel that the larger screen real estate on the tablet helps with controlling the device.  My iPhone worked really well, also, but I just thought the larger screen helped make it a bit easier.The Rover 2.0 looks cool, too.  It actually looks like something out of a sci-fi movie or a spy movie.  Unfortunately, it's not really quiet enough to actually spy on anything...but that's not that big of a deal to me.It's tank tread style treads allow it to get along well on any kind of flooring you'll have in your house, save for maybe REALLY long pile carpet.  It also does well outdoors on concrete or other hard surfaces.Overall, I really enjoy the Rover 2.0.  It's a fun gadget to pay around with in the house, and it's fun to use outdoors too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XAZZQ6ZK1OMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093285XK#wasThisHelpful","R1XAZZQ6ZK1OMI","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knifehead is awesome.  Plain and simple.This figure is GIANT.  I can't really describe how big he is.  Dimensions don't do him justice, he's just massive.  On the desk I have him fighting Gipsy and Cherno on, he takes up roughly half of it...and it's not a small desk, it's a typical home office sized desk.His lights are perfect for the figure...they work well and light up in a really eerie way that looks fantastic.  The articulation points are great.  You can even move his individual claws...awesome.The detailing and paint on his body are superb as well.  He just LOOKS like some kind of monster that dragged himself out of the sea.The only downside to this figure is that he needs a stand in order to stay upright.  Without it, he just topples over.I really can't say how much I love this thing.  Once I get my media room finished, and I have my shelf dedicated to ""Pacific Rim"" stuff, Knifehead is going to tower over everything else on that shelf...heck, he'll tower over almost every other prop and figure I'll have on display!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BB78TI8LV51O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F83DEBQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BB78TI8LV51O","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never had a Kyosho RC.  I've had tons of other stuff, but this is my first Kyosho.I can tell you this much...it will not be my last.The Mad Bug VE is well made, looks great, and has a great amount of power for just kind of bashing around the yard.  It's not the fastest thing in the world, but it's definitely not the slowest, either.  It has just the right amount of oomph to be a great offroad basher.The body looks amazing.  The graphics and the overall look are top notch.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well the controller felt in my hand.  The electronics all seem to be very good.For the price, this is a really good value in the RC world.  There's a bit of slop in the front end, but nothing that ever made me think it needed to be addressed...in fact, it almost seems as if it's deliberate to help keep the truck more durable.This is a great RC, and if you're on the fence, I think you'll like it.  4x4, brushless, 2.4ghz??

"I was an early adopter of Orbotix ""robots.""  I had a Sphero almost immediately after they came out, and a Sphero 2.0 the day they came out.  My wife has a regular Sphero as well.I've had an Ollie since about a week after it came out, and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it.I've used the Ollie extensively.  Fun is an understatement.  This thing FLIES.  It's fast, precise, and works very well.  I like how it almost magically turns on just by me holding my phone up to it.Many of the options you find in Sphero you find here...such as the ability to change the color of the lights and things like that.  You can adjust the speeds for indoor use or for outdoor use.Outdoor use is one of the big advantages to Ollie to me.  I've used the Sphero outside, and it just doesn't seem to be as fun as it is indoors.  It's simply a bit too slow.  Ollie, on the other hand, has plenty of wheels to get himself going on pavement and cement.  He's a blast to drive around outside.The only negative to Ollie??  I kind of wish I had gotten the Darkside version...the black looks killer...but, there's nothing wrong with being the good guy, I guess!!!This is a fun toy...I highly recommend it!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZ410NQROHIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV599OK#wasThisHelpful","RHZ410NQROHIK","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got my Echo right before they became available to the general public.  I'd been waiting for an invite for a while, and when I finally got it I was really excited.  That wore off a bit when I found out, two days later, that anyone would be able to get one on about the same day that mine would be arriving, but hey, at least I got it at the lower price with the remote.My wife didn't understand why I needed something like this.  Yes, I said needed.  I didn't tell her I wanted an Echo, I told her I needed one.I needed an AI companion to give me answers to things that I find clunky and annoying to look at otherwise.  Why get out my phone to look at the weather forecast for the next day when I can just politely ask Alexa what it is?  Why get on the computer to check the score of the Detroit Tigers game (hint, they're losing) when I can just ask Alexa.Within a few days, even my wife was sold...I think.  I find her interacting with the device about as often as I do, even if it's just for things like jokes and the Easter Egg type functions.Personally, I have found many of the basic functions of Alexa to be really useful.  I love being able to tell her to just play a radio station and having my favorite type of music instantly delivered to my ears.  I've found her to be really helpful when cooking...I'm the type of person that tends to forget to set timers or look at clocks when cooking, but with Alexa I can just ask for a timer...this is really helpful when cooking things on the grill that require constant flipping/turning...two minutes per side on a hotdog??  Just have Alexa set a two minute timer...repeat on the next side.  I've also found her to be very helpful with adding things to my shopping list.  I used to get to stores and always make it home and realize I forgot something because I forgot to write it down on my list in the first place.  Now I just tell Alexa to add it to my list, and then I don't have to worry about it.As a speaker, I think the Echo does a really good job.  I was surprised at the volume that was attainable through such a small device, and across the spectrum the sound is really clear.  Sure, there's some distortion at the highest volumes, but I don't know an awful lot of speakers that don't have some distortion when you crank it to 11.I'm giving the Echo a five, but obviously there are things I would like to see integrated in the future.For starters, it would be nice if the shopping lists and such were more tied directly to my phone.  I use an iPhone, so I wish there was some way that Alexa could have my shopping list be in the ""Notes"" app, instead of in the Echo app.  I know that's wishful thinking, but hey, it's what I'd like to see.Second, I'd like to be able to have the ability to control my Xbox ONE, or my cable box.  Being able to just ask ""Alexa, are there any good movies on right now?"" and having her show me a list of movies on my TV screen would be amazing.Finally, I really want to be able to change her name.  Although Alexa is fine, I'd prefer to be able to name the speaker something of my own choosing.  What do I want to name the speaker???  Jarvis, of course.  This, however, would probably mean I'd like it to have a male sounding voice as well.Overall, I think the Echo is great.  I can't wait to start getting some home automation stuff to work with the speaker.  I want to be able to tell her to turn the lights on in the bedroom when I'm getting ready for bed...no more using my phone as a flashlight to see if there are any cats laying in the hallway!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2INWAI057NM2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R2INWAI057NM2Z","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this headlamp when working on my RC models in my hobby room.  RC vehicles have lots of little nooks and crannies that light sometimes seems to not want to find it's way into.This light has been perfect for that.  It has four modes, bright white, dim white, red, and flashing (which has both red and white lights on).The two white modes work great for working on my RC vehicles.  I typically can just leave it on dim and get all the light I need, but I can turn the higher brightness on if I need some more lumens.For working outside in the dark, I believe the light would work well if you already knew your way around or there was a good bit of ambient light from other sources (the moon, street lights, etc.).  It would work to help you look at a map, or to help you read some instructions, but it's not putting out as much light as some of the bigger lights...but that's not to be expected based on size and price.For instance, I have other headlamps that I don't hesitate to use when riding my bike in the rural area I live in at night.  I don't think this light puts out enough light for me to feel comfortable doing that...however, it does put out enough light for me to feel comfortable using it on a lighted street or bike path.The other thing that I really like about this light is how lightweight it is.  My other headlamps are all brighter, but that comes at the price of being heavy and having a battery pack mounted on the side or back of the headband.  They can sometimes be a bit of a pain to wear, but this one goes on and feels like it's not even there.  Good stuff.Overall, for use indoors to help you see something in a dark area, or in a campground that has some ambient light you're going to find this light to be really solid.  As mentioned, I wouldn't use it for going hiking in the middle of the night when there's no moon, but I don't think that lights in this price range are meant for that in the first place.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7HIRY5L44AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ERPE2C#wasThisHelpful","R2H7HIRY5L44AI","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This camping ""lantern"" by BYBlight is really great.It uses three AA batteries, and easily lights up more than enough area around you for you to get around in the dark.  I've been using it to take my dogs out at night, and I'm pretty impressed by the amount of light it throws.  It's actually so bright that I can't look directly at it...it hurts my eyes.The lantern is very lightweight, has a unique ""pop up to turn it on"" mechanism, and the handles on top definitely come in handy.If you don't open the light all the way, it will still shine but since much of the area of the LEDs is blocked, it won't end up being quite as bright, which is nice for some uses.  When I'm not taking my dogs out with it, I'm keeping it on my nightstand in my bedroom.  If I need to get up in the middle of the night for anything, it's easy to just slide the light up a little bit and get enough light to easily see in the bedroom, without throwing so much light that it wakes my wife up.I am currently just using standard AA batteries in it.  I have some rechargeable batteries, but I haven't felt a need to put them in the light yet.I would highly recommend this camping lantern to anyone looking for a good, low cost, bright lamp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROHC0US76PL4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCBD3V0#wasThisHelpful","ROHC0US76PL4Y","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this costume to work on putting together a more detailed Captain America costume to wear for Halloween and to conventions.As other reviewers have stated, the quality of the ""extras"" in the package is basically just okay...the boot covers, mask, belt, and gauntlets are all fairly cheaply made and really don't work for the level of detail that I wanted to achieve when I was making my costume.  I figured that would be the case when I ordered it, though, and had planned all along on building or making the parts that I wanted to replace.The body suit itself, though, is really nice.  It's well put together, looks great, and seems to have pretty good quality materials.  It fit me well, although I am trying to lose some weight so that it fits me even better.  The zipper on it functions perfectly, and nothing is ripped or broken.  My mother is a fairly good seamstress, and I took it to her to have her check it out and she found nothing that needed to be reworked or changed right off the bat.Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase.  The other parts that I've been working on are coming out really well, too.  I feel that when I'm done the whole thing will look amazing!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B3J1EB3JKWZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081P6L8G#wasThisHelpful","R2B3J1EB3JKWZN","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am working on a Captain America costume, if that wasn't obvious...:)Anyways, I ended up buying a full suit because I wasn't sure that I'd be able to tackle putting one together completely from scratch.  It came with a mask, a utility belt, gauntlets, and boot covers...however, none of them were very nice.  The mask looked okay, but it was much too big.I ended up ordering this mask to go with the costume, and I am extremely impressed.  This one fits amazingly well, looks great, is easy to put on, and was a really good price.This mask fits me well, and I wear about a size 7 3/4 hat in a typical 5950 New Era baseball cap.  So, it's possible that it may be a bit large on you if you wear a significantly smaller hat size than that.Overall, I like this mask quite a bit.It fits me very well, and for reference I wear a size 7 3/4 hat in a New Era ball cap style.If you're looking for a Cap mask, give this one a shot!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GFWDEY6TI87T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PO5JE2#wasThisHelpful","R1GFWDEY6TI87T","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice shield for your Captain America costume.  It's plastic, so obviously it's not going to be as spectacular as some of the spun metal ones you'll see out there, but at this price point I don't think you should be expecting that type of awesomeness.What you get here is a good sized shield that looks good enough to go with your costume, doesn't weigh a lot, is nice and sturdy, and with a bit of work can be made a bit better.I think with a lot of costumes and accessories that adding and modifying are part of the fun.  On this shield, I have added an actual handle piece to the back instead of just the two elastic straps.  This gives me something to hold onto with one hand while the strap is around my forearm.I like this shield, and think that it looks really good, especially considering the low price point that it comes in at.Recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZO7K1CTV12R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA4WFCA#wasThisHelpful","RFZO7K1CTV12R","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a speaker system in my hobby room in my basement that requires my iPhone to be plugged into it for it to work.  It's a basic PC speaker system with two satellite speakers and one subwoofer.I had really wanted to upgrade to a Bluetooth speaker of some type for down there so that I can have the iPhone closer to me than the speaker system allows it to be.  I ended up giving this Bluetooth receiver a try, and I'm really glad that I did.The unit charges via USB and doesn't take long at all to charge.  It was easy to pair to my iPhone, with no problems at all.  Once I had it paired, I plugged the wire from the speaker system into the receiver, and as simple as that, it was done.  I launched the music player on the phone and I immediately had good quality music coming through the speakers!!!Every function on the phone works perfectly, and I can now have my speakers on one side of the room and my phone with me on the other so that I can control it and still listen to the music.  Awesome.The receiver has buttons on it that can be used to control the music, if that was something that you were interested in.  It doesn't really do much for me, as I'm using the phone to control all of the music...the receiver is just there to send the music to the speaker system.Overall, I really like this receiver.  It works really well, and does exactly what I had hoped it would do.  Now I can keep my 2+1 speaker system and use it wirelessly, instead of having to buy an entire new speaker.Highly recommended!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLLHHFR1ILOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM6BNP2#wasThisHelpful","RDLLHHFR1ILOM","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really cool coffe/drink mug.  It's well built, looks very good, and functions well.I really like the aesthetics of the mug.  As a gift for a photographer, it would be top notch!!  It really does look like it's made from a camera lens.  It's got all of the markings of a typical SLR style lens, the bottom looks like a lens cover, and the top even resembles a lens hood in a way.The inside of it is metal and keeps drinks cool or warm as well as any other insulated mug that I have, and it also keeps drinks cool very well.  It's easy to clean the inside, which is nice.The top has a nice closing feature so even if you're on a bumpy ride you don't have to worry about any of your beverage spilling out of the cup.  It's easy to get open, though, which is good.Overall, I really like the mug and would recommend it to anyone interested in a unique drinking cup.

"I grabbed a copy of Formula D having no idea what to really expect.I won't go into a great amount of detail about how the game is played, as that's been done numerous times in numerous reviews here and elsewhere.What I will say is that I chose it for Game Night with my wife one night, and she was reluctant to try it.  She didn't want to play a ""racing game"" at all.  I told her we can give it a shot for one game, and if she doesn't like it we can switch to something different.Several hours and several games later, we finally put the game away.  We loved it.  From start to finish it's just a FUN game.  There's enough strategy involved to give it some depth, but also enough chance that even with the best strategy something might go wrong...which to me is very realistic when compared to ""real"" racing...you can have the best car, the best driver, and the best crew...but none of that matters when an engine blows.We really enjoyed our time with the game, and look forward to many more sessions...also, we look forward to moving to the advanced rule set.I highly recommend the game.

"I'd say the wire is closer to 10 gauge than 8 gauge, but for a small, non power hungry amp, it's going to do the job really well.It comes with EVERYTHING you need in one low priced package to get an amp up and running, so that's great.

"I love this amplifier.I bought it knowing darn well that it wasn't going to put out 1100 watts as it's ""advertised"" as doing.  However, I didn't need 1100 watts of power.  I had two Rockford Fosgate 10s laying around the garage and hadn't had any bass in my car for a while.  I finally decided that I'd grab something to just mildly power them so that I could fill out my sound a bit.I installed the setup and was impressed.  From my ""old"" glory days in car stereo, I'm going to GUESS that the amp is putting out around 150 watts of power (into 2 ohms).  It moves my two low end RF 10s just fine, and provides enough oomph for me to feel it in the car.The external ""gain"" works really well.  I have the amp set up in ""low pass"" mode, which I have read is necessary for the external control to work, and I haven't had any issues with it not working.  My wife doesn't like much bass when she's driving, so she can just crank it all the way down and basically have the amp almost ""off.""  I can then get in and match it to the type of music I'm listening to and have my low end fix.For the price, if you go in with realistic expectations, this amp is literally going to blow you away.  Is it going to compete with stuff that costs 5 times as much and ACTUALLY puts out 1100 watts of power??  Not at all...but it's going to power some subwoofers to fill out the sound in your vehicle, and will be plenty enough for you to hear.  You might not be waking up the whole neighborhood...but, maybe, that's a good thing!!I recommend it, and will be looking into some of the other options for four channel amps to power some new component speakers I'm looking at for my old car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZJA2XCPWTRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S4XNEO#wasThisHelpful","R2NZJA2XCPWTRN","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Mixels are apparently some new cartoon show on Cartoon Network. The LEGO sets are very small, sold in just a single bag. Luckily, they aren't ""blind packs"" so you know what character you're getting.I ended up buying all of the Series One Mixels when I came across them in a local store. I decided to get them all at once so I didn't end up having to spend an arm and a leg to get that one last one a few months from now when they are no longer to be found in local stores.After having so much fun putting together all of the Series One characters, I did the same thing as soon as I saw the Series Two characters at that same local store. Oddly enough, I was able to get them all about two weeks before they were supposed to release.What I have come to notice about these characters in Series Two is that every single one of them seems to have one ""distinguishing"" feature that differentiates them from all of the other characters in the collection.Mesmo is a very cool Mixel figure.  He's got cool colors, some neat translucent pieces, and I really like his overall feature set.  He's got small but movable legs, and his wings can be posed in many ways.I think Mesmo has two distinguishing features.  First are going to be his wings.  There are other Mixels that have wings, but Mesmo's just seem to be a bit more ""movable"" and full of character to me.  His other distinguishing feature is his eyes.  Those ""hats"" that he has for eyebrows are really cool looking, and give him a really unique look.These are fun small sets that will only take an adult a few minutes to build, a child maybe a few more, but ultimately I think that they will provide a good amount of play time for kids due to the way that they move and the funny look that they have.

"I have used another set of TunePhonik headphones extensively, the iXR5 ear buds, and when I found out that TunePhonik was offering an over the ear headphone set, I figured it would be a winner.  My experience with the iXR5 ear buds has caused me to actually put all of my other headphones away, they were so comfortable and sounded so good that I didn't need anything else.The iZX5 set comes in a nice box...it's got an outer sleeve and a nice inner box that stays closed with two small magnets.  When you open that inner box you are treated to the headphones, folded up, and held nicely in place in a molded plastic insert.  The whole packaging just seems top notch, and was not at all what I was expecting for a set of headphones that come in at this price point.After taking the headphones out, they snap into the listening position nicely, and quickly adjust to the size that you need them.  The ratcheting mechanism for adjusting feels nice and strong, and I had no problems with them coming loose or anything like that while using them.The ear cups are very nicely padded, and feel comfortable when wearing them.  The headband is also nice and comfortable...and honestly, it almost feels as if it's filled with air.  I'm going to guess it's some kind of foam under the outer covering, but it really does feel like it's slightly inflated to provide comfortable support when wearing them.The cord is a very nice feeling cord, that is designed to resist tangles.  In my use, I have found that it is very good at doing just that...I never found the cord to be tangled up to the point where just a quick second of flipping it around wouldn't untangle it automatically.The iZX5 headphones, in my opinion, are a bit of an odd size for my ears.  Don't mistake this for me saying that they are uncomfortable, because they are very comfortable.  What I mean is that they are almost like a cross between an on ear headphone and an over the ear headphone.  They seem larger than most other on ear headphones that I've tried, but they definitely don't completely surround your ear.  I feel that the size contributes to how well they isolate sound.  When I'm listening to music in them, even at lower volumes, it's very difficult for me to get distracted by ambient noise going on around me.  That's a very good thing.  I did find, though, that it seems that they allow a little bit more sound OUT of the headphones than a typical pair of over the ear headphones...but this is to be expected seeing as they aren't completely surrounding your ear.The sound quality, in my opinion, was top notch.  There is plenty of volume, clean crisp highs, and sufficient low end bass.  I found the bass to be a very good level, as it wasn't overpowering, but it was enough to get a bit of ""thump"" going in your ears when you were listening to something very bass heavy.  Other headphones that I've used seem to have overpowering bass that ends up kind of making the rest of the aspects of the music just kind of disappear.  The entire range of frequency response seems very solid with the headphones, and I have found all of the genres of music that I listen to sound superb through the iZX5s...from jazz to classic rock, pop to hip-hop, the iZX5 didn't disappoint me in any of the playlists that I used them for.Using the headphones for watching videos or playing games was also enjoyable.  I found them particularly nice for watching videos...the amount of bass that they can produce when they need to really makes you feel parts of the movies/shows more than I have noticed with other headphones.Overall, I am truly impressed with the TunePhonik iZX5 headphones.  They pick up right where the iXR5's left off, and take it another step up.  I now have the best of both worlds, as the ear buds can be used on the go, and the on ear headphones can be used when I'm going to be sitting for a while.I highly recommend these headphones, they are truly a good value.  I look forward to seeing a version of these that run on Bluetooth, so that I can cut the cords!!!***FULL DISCLOSURE***I was provided a set of these by the manufacturer to review, however, I was not compensated for the review and my feelings about these headphones are honest and accurate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NP8Y2Q3GDWJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSN96CQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NP8Y2Q3GDWJ3","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled across the Dino Pet on another website.  Of course, it was sold out there, so I hit Amazon and found that it was being sold on Amazon.A quick note about shipping on this item...it comes from the actual manufacturer of the product, not Amazon or even the external seller (in my case it was Brookstone).  So, I basically paid Amazon, for a product from Brookstone, that ws then shipped to me from BioPop directly.  It took it a bit longer to actually ship, but once it did it arrived in two days.  Be sure to open your package immediately, as if you get one from here it's going to come with the living dinoflagellates in the box that should be put into the dinosaur right away.Anyways...on to the product.On a recent trip to the Cayman Islands, we went on a kayaking tour of a bioluminescent bay.  This bay was home to millions and millions of these tiny living beings called dinoflagellates.  They would light up when agitated in the sea.  Very cool.  You could see them light up as the kayak paddle passed through the water, or as you dangled your feet in the water.  Unfortunately, our kayaking trip was cut a bit short because of pretty terrible weather.  My parents were with my wife and I on this trip, and they had been really looking forward to this kayaking trip, so they were a bit bummed out by having it cut short.Shortly after the trip, I found the Dino Pet online and thought that it would make a GREAT gift for my parents, something to let them have a bit of that bioluminescent bay with them all the time.  I ordered it from Amazon, and found out about the shipping when it didn't ship by the expected date and I sent a message to the seller.When it did arrive, I thought that I had purchased the set that came with the gift certificate for the living creatures, so I just set the shipping box in the pile of gifts that I would need to end up wrapping.I opened it about six days later to find, to my terror, that the dinoflagellates had been in the box the whole time.  A quick read of the instructions had me worried that they may have died, as it says to put them into the acrylic dinosaur immediately after receiving them, because they need light to survive.  In the box, they of course hadn't been getting any light at all.  So, I put them in the dinosaur and hoped for the best.I did this in the early afternoon, so they had a few hours of light left before it was dark.  When it got dark, I gently shook the dinosaur, and noticed a few small flashes.  I didn't know if this was a good sign or a bad one...it was good because there were flashes, but bad because there weren't very many.The next day they had the whole day to be in the light...and that night, the light show was on!!!  They were all alive and well, and the results in the little dinosaur were absolutely stunning.  I left only a little bit of air in the dinosaur, which made it so that when you shake it you get a subtle glow throughout almost the entire inside of the dinosaur.I left it to do it's thing for the next few days before putting it back in it's box to be given to my parents as a Christmas gift.They absolutely loved it.  My mother has told me that when they wake up in the early morning (it's still dark) the dinoflagellates are always very bright.  They keep it right in the main living area of their house, so it's getting a good 10 hours of daylight or so every day, which is a pretty good amount of light.As another reviewer mentioned, these are living creatures, so they will need food from time to time.  The initial package comes with enough food to give you the initial feeding and a second feeding.  You can buy more from the manufacturer when you need it.  From what I understand, if you feed them when they need it, the colony will sustain for a very long time.I also wanted to note that the light that I perceive from these creatures is different than the light that shows up in the photos of them.  The light in the photos is a very aqua or teal blue type color, but the light that I see from them is more white or light blue.  I believe this to be a function of the way that cameras capture these creatures, as the images from the kayaking trip that we took shows the exact same color, but down there I noticed more white type light than the blue-ish in the images.Overall, I think this is a really cool product.  The gift went over amazingly well, and I couldn't have asked for a better thing to give my parents.If you're at all interested, give this product a go...it's a really neat thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6MVZ4GNMGKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTRD3DU#wasThisHelpful","R1L6MVZ4GNMGKL","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absolutely fantastic accessory for ""Selfie"" pictures, but it's more than that as well.The stick itself is superbly made.  It feels very robust, and the way it collapses and extends works flawlessly.  I also like how it locks itself into the extended positions.  I feel like the stick could survive quite a bit of abuse and live to tell about it.The remote that comes with it works great with my phone, and it allows me to take pictures of myself as the selfie stick is designed to do.  It also includes a nifty little tripod that you can use to set your phone on and then use the remote to take pictures of yourself without having it need the angles and sometimes odd body positioning that ""selfie"" type photos end up requiring, even with the use of a stick like this.The tripod also fits into the bottom of the stick, so that you can use it to support the camera up higher off of an object than with just the tripod, which allows you so many more options for photos.The thing that I like about this setup more than most of the other selfie sticks that I've had experience with is the mount.  The mount on the end is a perfect fit for a GoPro.  That means you can mount your GoPro to the end of this and get yourself a higher vantage point for your action films, or even just for regular video recording.  VERY cool.  This was a five star product to begin with, but the ability to use it for a GoPro makes it even better than a five star product.It's packaged well, looks nice, and comes with everything you need to use it...including a battery in the remote, an extra battery for the remote, and a keychain to use to make it easier to keep the remote from getting lost.If you're looking for something more than just a budget selfie kit, this is the one you need to take a serious look at.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UMRWC4QYB9Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYFECEW#wasThisHelpful","R3UMRWC4QYB9Z0","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DE Selfie Stick is an interesting gadget to have for when you want to take pictures of yourself.The device basically is a long pole that has an adjustable grip on the end that holds your camera.  You adjust the length and the angle, then you use the built in BlueTooth on the Selfie Stick to trigger the phone's shutter button, allowing you to take a ""selfie"" from much farther away than you would typically be able to with just your hand.The BlueTooth on the device connected to my phone with no hassles, and my iPhone 5 fit into the holder with no problems also.  It comes with easy to understand instructions and a small adapter to put on one of the adjustable arms on the phone holder to allow the arm to hold phones of different sizes.  I didn't need that for my phone, but some other phones might require it.The only thing I noticed about mine was that it had a tendency to not lock itself at the angle I wanted it very well.  What I mean is that no matter how much I tightened the bolt securing the phone at the proper angle, I was always able to move the phone maybe 5-10 degrees...so I had to compensate for that when setting up the stick for the photo.  I'm not sure if maybe mine has a defect or if this is just inherent in the design.  Either way, it's not really enough to worry about...it's just something I wanted to point out.The stick has a battery inside it, and it comes with a charging cable that plugs into a USB outlet.  It charges well and seems to last quite a while.Overall, I think this is a pretty cool gadget.  I've had times when I wish I had an extra foot or two of arm length in order to get a good picture of my wife and I with my phone, and now with this device I will have that extra foot or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QDJXPZM8OE6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCX5KPA#wasThisHelpful","R2QDJXPZM8OE6L","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This BT 4.0 adapter by Inateck added Bluetooth to a desktop computer that was previously lacking it.The packaging was nondescript, basically just a plastic bag.  This was okay by me, though, as it meant I didn't have to worry about disposing of an overly large box (such as what normally comes with these types of things in them) or worse yet, a plastic clamshell package.The device plugged into the USB slot on the back of my PC with no issues, and the drivers were easily installed with the included disc.  For what it's worth, the computer SEEMED to recognize it as a device, but I installed the drivers that were specifically included for the dongle just to make sure that it was using the best drivers for the best functionality.After installing the driver, I've been able to reliably use the device on this desktop with no issues.  I've tested BT headphones and a BT keyboard.  The keyboard is actually for my iPad, and I didn't remember I had it until I had done several connection tests with the headphones.  The device works flawlessly with both of these items, and I feel that anything else that I would try it with would work perfectly.For the price, I think this is a great way to add BT to a device that doesn't have it.  My desktop isn't exactly top of the line, but it's not bottom of the barrel, either...I was honestly surprised to find out that it did NOT have Bluetooth on it.  Now, I don't have to worry about that...this device works, very well, for a really great price.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PI2QRS3DQFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2E3ZHG#wasThisHelpful","R28PI2QRS3DQFU","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a very long time I was tossing my change into a glass jar on a shelf.  I would let it fill about halfway up, then take it to one of those CoinStar type places to have it turned into ""real"" money.  I was too lazy to count it out myself, and the price of using the CoinStar was worth it in my opinion.Well, recently a mischievous little cat jumped onto the shelf and decided the best idea was to push my trusty change jar off, causing it to crash to the floor.  I'm not sure what there was more of...broken pieces of glass, or actual change.  Either way, I was in need of a new coin jar.The DE Digital Counting Coin Bank works great for me.  The plastic (seems like polycarbonate) is very sturdy and should withstand numerous adventures from the shelf to the ground if that cat gets frisky again.  The top screws on securely, but is also incredibly easy to remove and put on.  The whole thing feels very sturdy, which is good.The coin counting mechanism works great.  I have tried it a bunch of times...from a single coin, to a whole handful of change put in one after another, and each time it has counted them exactly.  It does take a specific method to get the coins in, but once you figure it out it's easy to do it every time.  It took me about two coins to figure out that I needed to push the coin down while also making sure that there was pressure going in the direction of the counting mechanism.I like that you can adjust the amount in the bank with the buttons on the top.  This allows you to toss in a couple of dollars worth of quarters without worrying about putting each one in through the top of the bank.  I also like that there's a reset button on the bottom to set it back to $0.00.I will probably use the bank to count most of my change, but every now and then toss a handful in without counting it.  Why??  Because even when I know how much is in there, I'll probably still be too lazy to worry about taking it to the bank or wrapping it, so I'll still use the CoinStar.  By tossing a handful of coins in every now and then, I'll probably negate the cost of using the CoinStar, and then I'll end up getting ""real"" money back that is equal to what the bank is showing.  That's not really important, though...what is important is that the bank works, works well, and seems to be well made...all at a good price.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EV664K8DELKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O999WL6#wasThisHelpful","R2EV664K8DELKZ","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the two larger Circuit Board sets...the halfpipe and the skatepark.I've put everything together, and ended up needing another quarterpipe for the park that I was building.  I got mine at a local store, as at the time of this review Amazon only offers these blindly...they send you one of the four, but you get no say in which one you get.The product is the same great quality that the other ramps with the other sets are, and it comes with a full fingerboard that can be used with the Power Axle.This set is meant as an add-on for one of the larger sets, however, don't be discouraged if you don't have the larger sets.  These ramps can be used with other fingerboards, the included board, or the powered Circuit Boards if you have one of them.I really recommend these Circuit Board sets.  They're very cool, well made, and not too terribly expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21I0NIC7ZNUT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCQZJLE#wasThisHelpful","R21I0NIC7ZNUT2","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled on the Tony Hawk Circuit Boards products while browsing through a local department store.  I thought they looked pretty cool, and noticed that they were by Hexbugs, so I figured what the heck, I'll give them a shot.  I'm a big fan of RC stuff, and something as off the wall as a tiny RC skateboard seemed right up my alley, especially one that you could build an entire skate park for.  Very cool.I got the package home and opened it right up.  The first thing I noticed was how nice the parts all feel.  The ramps feel very solidly built, which shouldn't come as a surprise at all with the reputation that Hexbugs has.  I have several other Hexbugs products, and all of them are very nice quality items.  The Circuit Boards are no different.  I like the translucent ramps, it really gives it a cool feel...in a kind of geeky way, it kind of puts the ""Circuit"" into the name...it looks futuristic and slick.The board itself is really cool looking as well.  The graphics on it are really nicely done, and the top of the deck features actual skateboard grip tape as best as I can tell.  It comes with a small tool for attaching the Power Axle and tightening the wheels.  A quick note, when attaching the Power Axle, be very careful with the screws that you use to attach it to the deck, as they are VERY small and could easily be lost.Once you get the board all set to run, a quick ""roll"" forward with your hand will turn it on.  You are then off and running with your tiny RC skateboard!!The remote is a bit small for my giant hands (I'm an adult, though, so I'm not really the demographic that the remote is designed for), but it's still easy to hold onto and use.  There are two speed settings, one normal one and one ""Turbo"" one.  The turbo one I found to be a bit too fast for me to easily control the board right now, however, it does help get the board up to the top of ramps where the regular speed might not have quite enough oomph.  With the regular speed, the board is more easy to control.  You use it with the two buttons on the remote.  Pushing up on both of them at the same time makes the board go forward.  Pushing down makes it go backwards.  Pushing up on the RIGHT button makes the board turn left, and pushing up on the LEFT button makes the board turn right.  Pushing up on one and down on the other makes the board kind of spin right in place.  It takes a bit of getting used to the fact that the steering is opposite, but if you kind of tell yourself that to turn you are effectively making only ONE wheel go forward, then it will make more sense...what I mean is that if the right wheel is moving forward, but not the left, the board will naturally turn to the left.The ramps included with the Skatepark set are all really cool.  It's got a full halfpipe, some rounded ramps that look almost as if they would be part of a ""pool"" style to ride, a roll in ramp, and a set of stairs and rails.  I set mine up so that the halfpipe had the ""pool"" style ends hooked to the side of it, and spend most of my time ""skating"" on the halfpipe and around the end of the curves where the ""pool"" piece go.  I've used the other ramps quite a bit, too, but I'm not skilled enough yet to do anything really with the stairs and rails in particular.The ramps can be attached to each other with some ""pegs"" that are included in the box, and they hold the ramps together very well.  I've basically got my entire skatepark set up as three separate pieces...each consisting of several parts from the actual set.  They hold together well enough to be picked up and transported as a group, instead of having to take them apart to move them.I figured that I would like this product, but I didn't think that I would like it quite as much as I do.  I find myself going into my hobby room just to do a quick run, but then using the board for 10-15 minutes before realizing how long I've been playing with it.The decks that are sold as ""extras"" come with two sets of normal axles, so that even with the Power Axle not installed you can use them as normal fingerboards or just display them as tiny little skateboards.  I have no idea how to do any normal fingerboard tricks, but I've watched a few videos and guys and girls that CAN do the tricks with their hands seem to have no problem doing them with the Circuit Boards, so I would say that they are serviceable as a normal fingerboard as well.A few things to note:1.  Make sure you periodically check the nuts that hold the wheels on.  They can come loose, and if left too loose they can come off.  I would NOT want to spend time looking for one of these tiny things on the floor.  I haven't worried about it, but I'm guessing that a TINY dab of medium thread locker would take care of this issue.2.  If you are buying more than one, there are two channels available so you could have two of them running at the same time.  I have noticed, however, that different stores have different channels with different boards.  What I mean is this...at one store, the gray deck with one design will be Channel 1, and the red deck with the other design will be channel 2.  HOWEVER, at another store those channels can be reversed...what this means is that if you buy a set at one store, then buy the other deck at another store, you may inadvertently end up with the same channel, and thus you won't be able to run them at the same time.  This may have just been a coincidence that I ran into, but keep it in mind and make sure you check the channels.3.  When you attach the Power Axle to the board, it does a good job of blocking most of the graphics on the bottom of the deck.  So, if you have a deck that you really admire and want to look at, the Power Axle will make it difficult to see.4.  The wheels can get some dust on them, and if the rear wheels of the Power Axle get dust on them, they won't ""stick"" to the track quite as well.  I find that a quick wipe with anything slightly damp will get them nice and clean again...honestly, I just lick my finger and wipe the wheels off...but I'm sure a lightly damp piece of paper towel would work as well.  After that, they'll get better grip and be back to running like new.Overall, I'm really happy with this product.  It's fun to use, works well, is unique, and has survived quite a few falls off of my desk to the floor...so I'd say it's durable.  I liked it enough to buy a whole bunch of the ramps and stuff just a few days after getting my first set.Recommended.**Portions of this review are shared across multiple products in this Circuit Board line.  I have used many of the same paragraphs in several Circuit Board reviews, as I figure that many people will be looking at several of the sets as ""starter"" sets.  I apologize if you read the same basic review from me several times, but each one has been changed to reflect the actual product that is being reviewed...however, so many of the things from each review are the same, that I feel there's nothing wrong with using the same basic review for the things that are the same...such as how the boards work, and the quality of the parts.

"I have been using the DE Powerbank charger to charge my iPhone 5 for the last week or so.  I've been primarily charging the phone with this device, and when it gets low I charge it back up to continue testing on the phone.What I have come away with is a feeling that the product works well, provides good power and charging, and will definitely come in handy in those instances when I don't have access to an actual wall outlet.  For instance, at work I often would have to leave my phone in the break room area if I wanted to charge it, and I'm not comfortable doing this, so instead I can just bring the Powerbank out and charge the phone at my work station.  It will also come in handy in cases of emergency, as it will provide a good amount of backup power for the phone.  The iPhone 5 has a 1900mah-ish battery, so with the Powerbank I can get one full charge, and then another 1/3rd of a charge (roughly) if need be.  This would be enough for an overnight camping trip or a long day hike, easily.The added benefit in the emergency situation is the flashlight.  I found it to be very bright at the highest setting, bright enough to see at the low setting, and the strobe would be great for getting someone's attention if you needed to do so.  The light has functioned perfectly fine for me.Overall, I'm happy with the product and will be keeping it around my phone, to grab at times when I may be gone from home for longer than a few hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P6OI6MU8256N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV5Q0WM#wasThisHelpful","R1P6OI6MU8256N","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought an iPad Mini shortly after they came out.  I had been looking into getting a regular iPad, but felt that the size was just a bit more than what I wanted.  When the Mini came out, I went to look at them and was instantly hooked by the size of the device...it was exactly what I had been looking for.Over the year that I had it, I really enjoyed using it.  However, I found myself every once in a while wishing that it was a bit more snappy.  I thought that maybe I would just need to upgrade to the full sized iPad if I wanted the quicker responses and such that I was kind of hoping for.I had resisted upgrading to the Mini with Retina because I didn't think that it would really be much of an upgrade.  Sure, it had higher pixel density, and a faster processor...but it couldn't be THAT much of an upgrade, could it??Well, I ended up getting to a point where I was a bit tired of dragging my big heavy laptop around with me, and was planning on using my iPad as a bit of a replacement for the computer.  I started looking at articles and reviews about the Mini with Retina, and found out that I couldn't have been more wrong on the idea that it wasn't much of an upgrade.  Benchmark tests showed the Mini with Retina to be a MUCH faster and more powerful device than the original Mini.I didn't hesitate to make the purchase after finding out the information about the upgrades in performance.When the device arrived, I was pleasantly impressed by how much it felt the same. Form factor and weight were nearly identical, and it was a very natural transition going from the original Mini to the Mini with Retina.  I was then, of course, wowed by the speed and snappiness of the new Mini with Retina.  It was SO much more responsive than the Mini, and I wasn't really aware of what I was missing.The other thing that truly stunned me was how much of a difference the display actually DID make.  Even after making the purchase, I still figured that the display couldn't be THAT much better than the original Mini...however, with the Retina display things are so much more crisp, in particular text.  I can't see the pixels that I was able to see on the original Mini, and it just looks better overall.I've been really impressed with the iPad Mini with Retina.  It took everything that I liked about the original iPad Mini and made it better.  If you're looking for a small tablet, the iPad Mini with Retina should be on your list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBXODN5687Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNKRFEA#wasThisHelpful","RDBXODN5687Y7","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two of these lights for my father and myself for a trip we were taking together to Grand Cayman.  We are not SCUBA divers...well, he's certified but hasn't done it in a long time, and I'm not even certified.  However, the place we were staying at in Bodden Town has a really nice reef protecting it, and my parents had been there before and said that the snorkeling was great.  Last time they were there, my parents had watched some people do some night snorkeling, and my dad seemed really interested in it.I bought these lights so that we could do just that.  We only ended up getting to use them once because of rough water, wind, and rain the whole time we were there, but that one time turned out to be the absolute highlight of the trip for me.The lights arrived from Amazon quickly, as is always the case.  The boxes they come in are nice, and the instructions are easy enough to follow (it's a flashlight, though, I think any instructions at all would be easy to follow).  I took them out and inspected them, and was happy to find that they shipped with not just batteries, but actual Duracell brand batteries...so that was a good start!!I liked the wrist strap that is included with the light, it's a good way to make sure that you don't drop the thing.  It's a bit heavy when you're just holding it, but in the water that's not an issue at all.  As others have noted, it's a bit odd to get the light adjusted between the Low and High settings.  However, as soon as I figured out how to do it, it works very well and easily for me.  The problem I had was that I was trying to slide the switch, when you just need to press it.  Once I figured out how to do it, I never had another issue.We took the lights into the water for a good 30 minutes of snorkeling, and it was stupendous.  Nearly everywhere I shined the light on the reef, I could see reflections of little eyes looking out at me.  The beam was focused and bright, with enough light spilling out into a larger area to make large areas illuminated well enough to see.  We found a bunch of lobsters, some rays, and a Caribbean Reef Squid...all things that you wouldn't see out in the daylight at all.This light is now part of one of the more memorable things I've done on any vacation, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.I made sure to rinse the light off in fresh tap water to get all of the salt off of it, and then I let it air dry before putting it back together.  I wanted to go again really badly, but the weather simply didn't cooperate for the rest of the trip.I can attest to the hardiness of the light as well, unfortunately.  On the way home, our airline managed to pretty much destroy our gear bag.  It was ripped, smashed, and the wheels were broken off of it.  It was pretty well mangled.  My light didn't have it's box, as I had thrown it away to make room in the bag.  The light not only managed to make it through our bag getting destroyed, but it made it through it with flying colors...in fact, it was on when we go home.  The bag was NOT smashed like this when we arrived in the United States and picked the bag up for Customs, so it happened in the United States.  That doesn't really matter, but what it means is that for, at least, the 2.5 hour flight, along with the two hour drive home, then the hour of just sitting around before unpacking...the light didn't kill it's batteries.  It was warm...but the batteries were still going strong.  In fact, I've been using it every night when I take my dog for a walk on those initial batteries, and it's still going nice and throwing good light.I've been really happy with this light.  It makes me want to plan more and more trips to places where snorkeling is actually worth doing.  I won't get much use out of it here in Michigan, but hopefully I'll make it back to the Caribbean or Hawai'i sometime in the next two years or so.Overall, I recommend this light for snorkeling.  I can't really comment on it for SCUBA diving, but if you're going snorkeling and don't get to do it on a very regular basis and want a light that works for a price that won't break the bank, I think you'd be hard pressed to find something much better than this.I'm not sure if Amazon will allow this link, but here is a video I made of the night snorkeling with a GoPro Hero 3 Black showing how the light worked.  The camera picked up more reflections than my eyes, so some of the images are a bit more washed out than they appeared in real time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_ctnKk4ck","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RHCHOVEO8LYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BIWN7O#wasThisHelpful","R1RHCHOVEO8LYL","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the Aleratec Universal Tablet Hand Strap on my iPad Mini for a while now, and really like the product.I used to get cramps in my hand from holding the iPad with one hand while playing games for long sessions.  However, with this strap system that is no longer an issue.The strap is very easy to use.  You just select the right sized rubber pieces for your tablet (there are two sizes) and then stretch them over the edges of the tablet.  You then adjust the Velcro strap on the device to the size of your hand, and then you hold the tablet by simply holding your hand in front of you!!The device swivels to allow different orientations of the tablet.I really like the ease of holding the tablet that this strap gives me.  I can basically hold onto it without holding it at all...I just slip my hand through the strap and it's good to go.  It makes marathon gaming sessions on the tablet much more comfortable, and I recently used it to watch a movie while on an airplane.  It was a LOT nicer on the plane than trying to hold the tablet in my hand.If you're looking for a strap system to get a better way to hold onto your tablet, then this one will work for you very well.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4RXXOOAMI5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZOQDNW#wasThisHelpful","RH4RXXOOAMI5W","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The kickstand pad is solidly made, works well, and is easy to transport in your jacket pocket, your tank bag, or inside a panel on the bike.The plastic is solid, and it keeps the bike on it's stand on grass just fine...which means that it should work on just about any surface you can imagine, other than MAYBE the sand on a beach.I've tested it out several times, and each time I've had zero issues with it at all.  I'm comfortable to leave my bike on this without worrying too much about the possibility of the bike falling over.If I had to change one thing on it, I wish it were orange with black writing, instead of the other way around.  I have a tendency to lose these things after a few months, and I think if it were a brighter color I'd be more apt to notice it on the ground when I'm getting the bike set to leave a parking lot or whatever.Overall, five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38T2F8G4Z0BT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVO4RZY#wasThisHelpful","R38T2F8G4Z0BT3","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Capture Pro Clip that I recently started using a lot more often because I finally got a bag that has good enough support on the shoulder straps for it to work correctly.  On my other backpacks, the Capture ended up sliding off to the side of my body as the straps didn't stay in place very well.  On belts it worked fine, but I typically don't wear belts very often.Anyways, I got a new backpack that has a much better chest support, so the Capture was getting a lot more use...and that is a really nice system.My fear, though, was dropping my camera.  The Capture holds the camera perfectly secure, so no worries there, but I was finding myself very tempted to use the system with no strap in place, and after almost dropping it recently at an Art Festival, I decided to start using my old strap as a ""safety"" if you will.  Basically, I was using the Capture, then having my neck strap around my neck anyways, so if I dropped the camera it would fall and hit me in the stomach, instead of hitting the ground.  The problem with that??  Most camera neck straps aren't really designed to be worn in a way that allows them to be ""slack"" or loose around your neck, which is what happens when you are using the Capture.  It's also uncomfortable, and to be honest it looks terrible.I had remembered seeing a strap on the Peak Design's site when I was looking into the Capture system.  I decided to go and take a look at it.One quick look had me sold, as they actually advertise and show you how to use the ""Leash"" as a safety for your camera when using Capture.  I then started looking at some of the other features of the Leash, and decided that this was something I had to have.I ordered from Amazon with Prime shipping and had the product in just one business day, despite not spending the money for overnight shipping which is nice.I quickly set about setting up the Leash on my backpack with Capture.  The one Anchor mounted to a D-Ring on my backpack that was right near the Capture Clip.  The other Anchor I mounted to the left strap mount on my DSLR.  I then adjusted the length of the Leash so that it was as short as possible, and then tested it out.  With the system in place, if I were to drop my camera, it would end up hitting me right in my thigh, which is perfect for me.  It gives me enough room to actually use the camera with ease, while also giving me the peace of mind of knowing that if I manage to somehow drop this camera, I'm not going to be in the market for a new one.I then set about looking at some of the other ways that you can use the Leash.  As a standard camera strap, I actually found it to be more comfortable than my normal camera strap.  I will give you that I was just using the strap that came with my T3i, but the Leash is a lot more comfortable to wear.What I really liked though, was mounting one Anchor to the left side of the camera, and the other to the bottom of the camera on the Capture Plate, and using it as a sling.  With the Leash set up like this, the camera hangs with it's lens facing down, and is quickly and easily able to be pulled up to your eye to be used instantly.I had never really thought about WHY seatbelts in cars are made out of what they are made out of, but having the Leash really illustrates the reason...they don't get caught on your clothes at all.  You slide around in a seatbelt without worrying about your clothes getting caught or rubbing or anything.  The same can be said about the Leash.  The seatbelt material allows you to easily swing the camera round your body while it's in the sling position without worrying about it getting caught up in or on your clothes.  It's really a simple concept, but it works to perfection.I've used the system with it as a safety on my backpack several times now, and I will say that it makes me more willing to take some shots holding the camera at odd angles and such, as I am now not worried about dropping the darn thing.Overall, this is an awesome product.  It's the perfect complement to the Capture Clip, but it's also great as a stand alone camera strap.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if anything ever happened to this one.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XWUDU9IDPNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBPIRYS#wasThisHelpful","R8XWUDU9IDPNO","A58437AUQICZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A58437AUQICZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This system requires cable for powering cameras and that is the most difficult part of installation. The steps are to install cameras at desired locations (they do need power outlet); then connect the monitor to the router with an ethernet cable and to the power outlet; and finish the setup on screen. After that you can download Android and iOS apps and connect the receiver to the app by scanning the QR code on the back of the receiver or manually enter UID and then setup the password.We use two way audio cameras to care for our elderly relatives - mother and mother-in-law - but this setup with two way audio can have a wide variety of uses.They call camera weather resistant but at the same time state """"not intended for direct exposure to rain or snow"". So I guess it has to be under soffit or sunshade or some overhang like that if you use outdoors. ""Wireless"" is also a partial misnomer because the camera power adapter has to be connected to the power outlet. And the cameras are not subtle, they are quite prominent but most microphone cameras are like that.

"If you measure your own blood pressure, which you should if you have high BP, the wrist blood pressure units are a lot easier to use. With the wrist unit, the technique of measurement is very crucial: the monitor should be at the level of the heart and cuff should be half an inch above the wrist. As the studies by Consumer Reports, and Mount Sinai Medical School have shown, with proper technique, the readings from wrist blood pressure units are accurate and comparable to upper arm cuff units. For last 4 years, I have used Omron 7 Series Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor almost every day and it has given fairly accurate readings.Blood pressure readings, and for that matter all other health readings like weight, pulse, activity level etc. are most useful when they are tracked and you can visualize the progress or change over time and see the impact that interventions, like taking a blood pressure medicine, make. And it is lot easier, if you can monitor all those measurements in the same app on your mobile device and same website on the Internet.However, as of now, there are a variety of measurement devices for blood pressure, weight, activity, and they all have their own apps and websites. Not all of them send the information to a unifying app like Apple Health or Microsoft HealthVault or Argus etc. Some companies like iHealth, Withings, FitBit, Homedic are beginning to make multiple tracking devices, but still track it on their proprietary apps and web sites.Over the last 3 years, I have used 2 other Bluetooth wireless wrist BP monitors, one from Homedics and other iHealth. Both had bad connection problems and tracked BP on their proprietary apps. On ihealth, you cannot easily measure BP without  their app.Omron is the leader in BP measuring sphygmomanometers, both upper arm and wrist. This is their WIRELESS wrist BP measuring unit.The readings are accurate, unit is easy to use, BP measuring instructions are in the storage box. Instruction manual is several pages long and first few pages full of legal verbiage. But if you download the Omron Wellness app from Apple store, it has self explanatory pairing and transfer instructions. Your BP readings are transferred to the App, and from there to ""the cloud"" after you press the transfer button on the unit. You can measure BP without  the app.Overall, it is the best wireless wrist unit available on the market as of now (of the three that I tried - Homedics and iHealth). But it is not perfect. Here are the problems/uncertainties about this unit:1. It stores measurements for only as one user.2. So far I have not seen BP readings appear in other unifying Health apps, like Apple Health, Microsoft HealthVault, Argus etc.3. I have used this unit for a short time and I am not sure how the Bluetooth connection holds up. Major problem with other wrist BP units (and other health measuring devices like weighing machine, pedometers etc.) has been that Bluetooth connection does stay connected over time.So if you are looking for a just simple wrist blood pressure unit, then I would recommend Omron series 7 wrist blood pressure unit, which is very accurate (even confirmed by Consumer Reports). But if tracking and wireless connectivity is important to you, then buy this one, although it does not connect to other health tracking data apps and longer use will tell whether Bluetooth connection works well over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D4IHCM20WFR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H76PTU#wasThisHelpful","R2D4IHCM20WFR2","A2QRXQPHDMFCQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QRXQPHDMFCQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is dishwasher safe, BPA free and leak and spill proof.  Another bonus: It has a small handle on top, making it easy to carry or attach to a backpack for hiking or a stroller.The only negative is that the top of the bottle is heavier than the rest, making it a little more likely to tip if one is not careful.Overall, this is a good, spill proof bottle.

"Everyone has their personal preferences when it comes to pillows.  I like foam, my wife likes feathers/down. This pillow is foam, so I will be the one to use it.First of all, the outer covering is made of bamboo, which feels great.  Soft and silky! It is nice but cannot be removed for washing.  That will not present a problem if you put a zip case on it, then use the outer pillow case.This is a heavy pillow.  It is packed with foam pieces, which in my opinion, are more desirable than one giant piece of foam.  However, it is so overstuffed that I hardly get any benefit of the memory foam.When you first unwrap it had an odor but the instructions mention that it will and the pillow can be aired out to eradicate the smell.

"This is a soft foam applicator that my wife used with her smashbox foundation.  (No concealer actually comes with the tool, so it could not be tested with any of the Scott Vincent Borba products.)First, negatives out of the way:1-Way too expensive at $40, as of now. The price needs to be lowered for this product.2-There are no cleaning instructions with the tool, so one is left to their own vices as to what cleaning product to use. She finds warm water and facial cleansing soap work just fine.On the positive side, this tool helps blend really well and the smoothness of the stem makes it easy on the hands--ergonomically friendly. The angle is perfect for reaching otherwise difficult areas, which she would normally do with my finger.She is giving it 4 stars solely on the basis that this item is overpriced. Had it been about $20, I would have given it 5.  Because it is so new,  she does not know how long the foam part will hold up.

I am a busy nursing student and work 12 hour shifts at the oncology unit. Some days I go home and basically fall flat on my face on the carpet when I am off work because my feet and legs hurt SO BAD! I got these socks because I know the importance of a good compression sock for wellness of the lower extremities!These socks go on smooth, dont bunch, gather or pull. They look very sleek on too. I love the fun colors they come in. I got the green because I needed a size large. I would recommend the large if you have a larger calf. The top doesnt cut into my leg or become uncomfortable into my shift. They stay up and dont fall or cause problems.The socks provide the exact compression I need to encourage venous return and circulation and keep my legs feeling fresh and non-tired all day/night. The sock part supports my arch and the fabric of the whole sock if very breathable. I would give these 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Shin Splint Compression Sleeves By Run Forever Sports - Health & Fitness Accessories for Men & Women - Ideal for Running, Cycling, Nurses.I got the large size in these. I am a size 16-18 woman and my calfs are larger. The sizing was perfect and these fit good. I am a busy nurse and sometimes travel as much as 6 miles per shift on my feet. I was used to coming home at night with swollen ankles and burning legs and feet. I got these calf compression sleeves and the other ones the company makes and I have to say, I love both!These sleeves are a different material then their other style. This is more cotton-soft. The other are more nylon-smooth. I think both are special in their own way. The fabric on these are moisture wicking. I can pull these off my legs after being on shift for almost 12.5 hours and it is not sweaty or damp underneath. I simply throw these in the machine to wash them on cold, and hang dry them. I guess technically you could dry them  but I am scared they may shrink!These go on easy and dont bunch or snag. I also have taller legs and they fit the whole length of my calf. Which is nice, because I have a few other pairs from other companies that cut off half way up my calf. Not very comfortable  but these are super comfortable! Also the top banding stays up strong and doesnt curl or start to fall down half way through my shift. Thats good because I dont want to have to take time away from my patients pulling this stuff up all day.Overall, if you are looking for good quality compression  these are it! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Running Socks for Women and Men - Soft and Smooth Copper Infused No Show Athletic Socks that Kills 99.9% Bacteria with Antimicrobial Fabric.I am a busy nurse and pull 12 hour shifts as my regular work schedule. I need great foot support and protection. Thats where these socks come in.I normally wear compression sleeves on the calves of my legs, and then need a superior sock for the foot bed. I thought I would try these socks to pair up with my compression and see how my feet and legs ended up at the end of my shift. I love these socks because they feature a comfortable copper infused bottom of foot cover, soft material to conform to my foot shape, the non-slip tabs help keep these in place and dont move around and cause irritation, and the sole support doesnt start to wear and become thin.My feet at the end of my shift were fresh and dry. They felt great in my shoes, providing a nice softness but still a hardy support. The shoes didnt shift, bunch or move in my shoes and at the end of the night, I took them off and washed them in cold water and machine dried and they were as good as new. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the BTArtbox Large Sheet Halloween Stickers 3D Water Transfer Nail Decals - Pumpkin, Skull, Black Cat, Bat, Spider, Ghost, Witch - Over 180+ Halloween Designs.These are fun nail stickers that come in a TON of designs. You pay very little for like a YEARS worth of stuff to put on your nails. I got these at a non-Halloween time as they have a ton of stuff that can be used year round. I use the skulls, candles, fire and spiders all the time. They add a fun touch to a manicure or pedicure.These stickers have a learning curve to apply. This is the easiest way I found to use them Get a pair of VERY small stainless steel sharp mini scissors  cut your design. Be sure to basically cut it as close to the design as possible so you dont have a ton of paper all over your nail to make positioning hard. I then at this point use a pair of tweezers and a drop of water on top of my nail polish. I set the design down into the water and position exactly how I want it. Then I drop water on the top and it starts to stick, wait a while, peel the paper and then let it dry completely. It will be there until you remove the polish with acetone.The colors are vibrant and fun. I want to get the Christmas set next! Once you figure out how to effectively and efficiently apply these, they are easier to use then nail polish for nail art, and smoother then stickers for designs. 5/5 stars.If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

" 3:19 MinsThis review is for the Yahoho Women's Small Compact Wax Genuine Leather Tri-Fold Wallet with Zipper Pocket Orange.This is a stunning, well-made wallet from Yahoho. I needed a nice leather wallet to hold my cards. I didnt want something massive or large that would be bulky to carry around or take up half my purse. This slim line wallet is great and holds a lot but doesnt get in the way.The leather is super soft and pliable, the grain is beautiful and shiny. I can tell this wallet only gets better with each use. Inside, there are a lot of card compartments. There is the ID holder which has a window for your most important cards or photograph identification. Then about size other slots for regular cards. Ill admit in the United States this doesnt hold all my cards. I have like 40 cards. But I keep the rest separate and only keep my most important in the wallet: Starbucks, Target, Debit, Credit, Costco and Grocery!The money compartment is unique. It holds your cash perfectly and keeps it crisp  but then has a zippered pocket in the back for other stuff. You could keep checks in there or change! It has a nice golden zipper pull. It keeps everything secure. The top has a snap to hold it all together and closes easily and doesnt fall open. Overall, I give this wallet 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the DareTang P2p Wifi Spy Camera Adapter H.264 Format Hd 720p Ip Network DVR Hidden Adapter Camera 90 Degree View Angle Mini Camcorder Video Recorder Cam.This is a unique little camera. I was thankful for the document the company emailed me clearly stating in step by step directions how to connect this thing. It was a little complicated  but once I got it working  it was great.You simply turn on your cell phones Wi-Fi window. (I am using an iPad Mini) I connected to the one titled: CM482374374384734  it connects without asking for a password. Once you are connected  open the P2plivecam app and hit Search(LAN) the camera should just automatically show up under there. I actually had to close the app and reopen it to see the camera in the searchLAN option. But once it was there  I connected and it asked me to change my password.I also configured the camera to run on my own private network instead of the open CM one. Once I had the password changed and my private network installed, it felt safe and secure to me.The picture is actually surprisingly clear for a mini spy camera. The camera does not have night support so it is totally dark at night. But during the daytime, if you can plug in the camera to an outlet that shows the area you want to watch, it is a great security camera. I have it facing on my living room and I can actually see it quite clearly.Also, the documentation stated several times to install a TF card in the back. I didnt have money for one  so I tried to run this without a TF card and it works just fine. I realized that the TF is if you want to RECORD stuff from it. I just am happy using it in the app and watching stuff when I want  so I dont need to install the TF card.Also I read some other reviews on this and they stated theres a flashing light. Mine doesnt have a flashing light  so Im not sure what they are talking about. Maybe if its RECORDING it flashes? Not sure, but its fine just with the camera mode. The unit is very inconspicuous and no one will notice it because its just a black plug thing. Its great for the purpose it is being purchased for and I am enjoying using it to feel safe at home and watch my house when I am away to make sure everything is OK. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Elegant Amber/antique Style Magnifying Glass Necklace/pendant- 3x Magnification with 30"" Matching Chain.The reason I wanted this magnifying glass is rather unique. I need readers when I am reading my text book for class. But honestly, I never need glasses most of the other time. When I am at a restaurant and reading the menu  dont need readers. Just when I am reading text for longer periods of time. However, I am a nurse there is ONE time in the hospital when I am with my patients I need magnifying  and its when I am administering 1 unit of insulin to diabetic patients!The insulin syringe cap is orange and bulky and covers the very top two units of lines. I am CONSTANTLY squinting trying to be sure I have EXACTLY one unit. I always have another nurse double check me to be SURE I am EXACTLY on the ONE UNIT line This magnifying glass has finally allowed me to be able to just throw it on my neck before I leave for work, keep it on under my scrub top  and pull it out like the ONE TIME A DAY when I need extra eye site power! I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THIS HANDY LITTLE TOOL!The magnifying glass has a really pretty amber turtle shell frame that looks cute. The chain is easy to wear and doesnt cause skin irritation. I can also clean the chain with hospital grade cleaners and its good to go. This is ULTRA light and you can barely tell you have it on. You could also throw it in your pocket if you didnt want to wear it on the chain! VERY nice piece! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Pipik-Ring Holder.I got this silly little ring holder because I couldnt resist its charm. When I got it in the mail  it was a LOT smaller than I expected! I dont know if its because in the photographs his member is so HUGE it makes this thing look massive  but its actually rather petite which makes perfect sense, because it holds rings, lol.This would be a hecka funny white elephant gift or a gift for a bachelor party. It holds about six of my rings. Its fun to just set on the table and see who notices this ring holder with a giant you know what. (Amazon censored, Lol).The holder is made from good quality materials. I dont know what this stuff is called, maybe hand painted fiber glass? You can put a lot of stuff on it and it won't fall over. I have a lot of thicker rings on the arms, and a few earrings and its still good. Also, it has a ton of details  but I think you probably noticed that from the Amazon photographs haha.A fun, unique, kitschy gift for yourself or someone else. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Lucky Love Baby Moccasins  100% Genuine Leather  Infant, Babies & Toddlers Shoes for Girls and Boys  100% Money Back Guarantee.I got these for my best friend who is having a baby in one month. She is having a little girl and this is how she describes her future child: a chic boho baby! Her description makes me laugh every time I hear it  so when I saw this trendy little leather moccasins  I KNEW her future boho baby needed a pair to wear with her flower headband and cute little pink outfit!These shoes are made with ULTRA SOFT top quality leather and it is thin and non-restrictive. I dont think a child would want clunky thick leather shoes  these would go on baby easily and they wouldnt even be able to tell they have them on. The bows are cute details and cut with precision and attached well with a loop closure. The back have adorable little pink tassels that give them that edgy in-style look. Every little baby needs a pair of these moccasins!The stitching is incredibly straight and there are no loose threads. You could wipe these off with a damp cloth and allow for air dry and they will be looking like new! I got the 6-12 month for the newborn so she has a bit of time to grow into them and can wear them when mom will start dressing her up more with hair accessories and trendy outfits.These booties are totally a 5/5 stars for design, cuteness level and craftsmanship!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Electsun Battery Operated 2.3m White & Brown 4cm Rattan Ball Fairy Lights - Ideal Wedding, Christmas & Party Fairy String Lights.This is a beautiful set of string lights with twine balls. The balls are multicolored  dark and light. They alternate between the two colors across the 2.3m of string length.I got this set to put on a dresser that wasnt even near an outlet. I love the battery operated design of these lights. It takes 3xAA batteries which are not included. I have left the lights on all night and the batteries do not die  so these are actually very efficient in their power usage.The twine balls stay attached to the lights perfectly and do not fall off. I love the diffused look of the lights due to the twine covering the twinkle lights. They are not too bright but not too dark. Very ambient and lovely.The set can be stored in a box or a bag and it will not tangle very easily. These would look lovely on a patio, a bush, across a dining room table, on a window or whatever else you can imagine.

"This review is for the VMATE 18x18 Inch Black Skull Halloween Present Linen Cushion Covers Pillow Cases Trick or Treating Custom Zippered.I love this edgy skull pillow case. This case covers any basic pillow that is 18x18 or smaller. I love updating the look of my rooms without having to buy ALL new stuff. This just slips over any existing pillow and brings new life and dcor into the house!This pillow is stitched well and it is very sturdy. This will not unravel or start to fray. The zipper is one of those small almost invisible zippers, it is on the side and is pretty well hidden once you put the pillow inside. The pillow case could technically be turned inside out and machine washed cold on delicate. Then I would lay it flat on a table and let it air dry.The color of the black is vibrant and the pattern is intricate and well-designed. I love the damask with the skull, its very trendy. I have a lot of black damask mirrors throughout my home and I have black bedding, so this pillow looks completely cute on my bed. I wish it also came in dark pink so I could get an accent color. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the New U8 Bluetooth Smart Watch WristWatch Phone with Camera Touch Screen Long Life Battery for Android OS and IOS Smartphone Samsung Smartphone (Black).I was sent this smartwatch for review. I assumed since the title had: IOS in it, it would work with Apple. I was wrong  I do not have an Android. Therefore, I had to give this to my friend who has one so we could test and play with it!This watch is VERY intuitive and easy to use. I hateeeeeeee reading instruction manuals and I literally opened the package on this one  paired the device with my friends phone and it was good to go. From there, all the subscreens are very easy to use. I set the time and date right away as well as the city. It connected with the phone and got messages  calendar  a pedometer set up  alarm  photos  notifier  music  sleep watch  phonebook and passcodes. This is a cool little watch! I really wish I had this for my Apple products!The scrolling is easy and fluid  there is no weird pauses and it is easy to do. The buttons click with rapid response  I was expecting for something this price a rather slow, sluggish unit. I was wrong  this thing is fast! It also has many functions!The screen is vivid and very colorful, and the sound is strong and loud Too loud for normal use  if you are in a classroom, office, and theatre  you will most likely WANT to turn off the volume Very loud! But awesome if you are walking, hiking, hanging out with friends, at home or at the mall! It also has vibration which I was not able to use but my friend did.It comes packaged in a nice small little box which you could store it in. The banding is rather cheap  its just black silicon  you may be able to find something else to switch it out with. Also it would be nice if it came in colors! Next time, Ill find one of these that work with Apple! GREAT watch! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the VMATE Women Retro Fringe Tassel Bag Drawstring Bucket Faux Suede Small Mini Shoulder Bag Messenger Bag.This is a cute little purple suede bag that brings a pop of color to my fall and winter outfits. I wanted something light and small that wouldnt get in the way, but was enough to hold my wallet, keys and cellphone. This mini bucket bag does the trick and I am able to just effortlessly throw it on in the morning and go!The bucket design is lined with a soft black fabric. The outside is that luscious faux suede you see in the photos. You can wipe it down with a cool cloth and air dry if something gets on it. The suede is scratch free and nicely cut. The stitching is straight and there are no loose threads.The tassels on the side being a boho design to this bag. They are trendy and in style right now. I love the tassels on the pull on the front. The pull is made from a waxy black rope and opens and closes easily. The bag is VERY secure when I shut it and stuff does not fall out. There is also a snap on the top that secures it even more.The strap is adjustable and I dont even notice Im carrying it when I have it on. 5/5 stars for materials, design and craftsmanship!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Yacun Women's Sleeveless Chiffon Bohemian Swing Casual Maxi Dress Plus Size 2XL.This is a beautiful blue flowy dress. I am a size 16-18 and got the 2XL. The sizing is VERY true to size. It surprised me as the clothing I get from China I usually have to get about 1-2 sizes larger, but this is cut to American sizing.The dress is a nice breathable fabric that is very smooth. The dress is flattering and doesnt cause static or cling to the body. There is an under layer that is satiny and provides coverage because the main fabric is rather sheer. I also wear a spanx type undergarment with this. It looks absolutely beautiful and hides unsightly problem areas.The dress is long. I am almost 59 and the dress comes to my ankles. Not sure what you could do if you were petite  you would have to get this dress altered most likely for length. I LOVE how long it is though, because it is hard to find dresses that are so flattering and long!The sleeves are a tad tight  I think they forgot that larger girls need larger arm openings. It doesnt really bother me though, but it does come right up to the armpit. The back ties well and it doesnt show a lot of skin.

"This review is for the Fytto Style 1080 Comfy Compression Sock, 15-20mmhg, Knee High (Large, Black).I am a busy nurse and constantly on the go. I am also constantly looking for the perfect pair of compression socks to keep my legs in check and blood flow moving. These socks are close to the perfect pair, I just wish they came in fun colors!The socks are soft material that is moisture wicking. I am on my feet for 12 hours a day. When I get home, if I dont wear these socks, my legs are swollen and my skin tender and feet tender. Its from swelling, inflammation and non-compliant circulation in my lower extremities. These socks go on smooth, pull up easily, and have a handy sizing chart so I was sure to get the perfect fit.Once I have these socks on, there is no rolling of the upper banding or bunching. It also doesnt cut off blood flow right on the banding which some of my socks do. The heels and toes are strong and made of good fabric that wont rub through or over time break  these are solid socks. My shoes go on easy over these and there is no bunching under the shoes either.My scrub pants legs also are smooth over the top. At the end of my day  my feet are 75% less painful, 75% less swollen and no edema or inflammation is hardly present. Who knew just simply wearing compression socks could have such wonderful results? These socks definitely help! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the A TE Charm Bracelet Woman and Girls Heart Crystals Pink Glass Beads Fits Pandora 7.5"" JW-B12.This is a fun charm bracelet that is very feminine and girlie. I got this to pair with silver bangles. The light pink stones and gems are really cute and sparkle in the light!The bracelet fits my wrist perfectly. This cannot be adjusted, but it is easy to get on and take off with the circular clasp design. The charms are moveable. There is one dangle charm that has several pink gemstones on it. It hits the light and glitters! The glass light pink stones are very pretty. I have never seen a charm bracelet with this much details!The silver chain all the charms hang on is very smooth and pretty. I love the owl charm and heart charm, they give a personalized look to the charm bracelet. This would make a lovely gift for most ages. Just be sure to take a measurement of the wrist of the person you are getting it for, as I said earlier, it is not adjustable! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Colorful Washi Masking Tape (Set of 10 Rolls) - Wide Japanese Decorative Paper Tape with Geometric Pattern Designs, Cute Colored Collection.This is totally the nicest set of washi tape I own. I LOVE that it comes in a million colors and patterns in the package for the great price. I collect washi and have several jars filled with fun tape.These rolls are WELL made and the tape is thick and quality. There is a TON of tape per roll! I mean you could do a plethora of projects and still have a bunch of tape left over. What I love about this tape is how easy it comes off the rolls  it doesnt tear or rip unnecessarily. It also goes on smooth, no bubbles, bunching or uneven application.The color is very vibrant and fun. The color doesnt fade and you can see it from far way. It really adds to a piece of artwork or project. There is a little something for everyone in this package  lots of variety. I would say this tape is better than my scotch brand washi or some of my other higher end tapes. Definitely 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Zero Point- Real Graduated Intense Compression Sock Women.I love compression items from Zero Point. This is my second pair of compressions from them. I got the PINK calf sleeves to begin with, and the material is SO ultra-soft and really supportive, I really wanted to try their socks. I am a busy nurse I walk/run around to my patients a total of approx 6 miles a day. At the end of my day, my legs are BURNING! I knew I had to try something to combat the pain and swelling  hence my obsession with compression!These socks go all the way up the legs and stay TOTALLY smooth and wrinkle free. The tops do NOT roll down which I love. I have tried other compression items, and they slowly roll. These socks stayed up strong all day from beginning of shift to handoff at night. The material is so soft I forget I have them. Yet they are still giving me pressure to keep swelling at bay, blood from pooling in my lower extremities, and my valves and circulation are strong and well managed all day. I actually come home with WAY LESS PAIN then I have previously. These socks are so great!I got the W3 sizing. I am a size 9 and I am a larger girl, size 16. This size fit me great  and also I love the bright pink color. It provides a fun pop of color under my BORING nurses uniform scrubs I am forced to wear. I am a total compression convert  I wear them 7 days a week now. Quality socks that work well, 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the YourEcoFamily Certified Organic Cotton Knitted Blanket - Softest Knit Blanket For Your Baby, Toddler Boy or Girl - High Quality - 30"" X 40"" (Beige).This is a very cute, and very soft baby blanket. I got this for my best friend who is having a little girl. She needs things are that useful and well-made. This blanket is definitely a great gifting item!The blanket is a nice 30x40 size which is PERFECT for baby! You dont want anything bigger as the material may start to over overwhelm baby and become dangerous if there is too much extra slack of fabric around your baby. This blanket lays perfectly over the top of a new born or larger baby, and covers them and gives them a nice warmth.I am only purchasing organic fabrics for my friends child. I dont want any extra chemicals or treatments on the blanket that could be harmful to the baby. This blanket is made with the SOFTEST material! It is VERY well made. The pattern and stitching are exquisite. I love the checkerboard panels  it gives it a young look but at the same time this blanket is very sophisticated and neutral. The color is great for any color nursery  so if you are getting this as a gift you dont have to worry about will it match or not. The border is double stitched so the blanket will not unravel. I think this blanket will carry the baby through a lot of years and maybe become a toddlers hugging blanket so they could carry it around. You could also use this blanket for your feet if they are cold and you are no longer using it for your baby. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the SLS3 Women's True Graduated Butterfly Compression, Performance, Training, Race, Recovery Socks (1 pair).These are the cutest compression socks I own. I am a busy nurse and on my feet for 12 hour shifts a day! I have carried my pedometer with me to work and I clock in approx 6 miles a shift. At the end of my day, my legs and feet are BURNING! Thats when I started wearing compression socks and it opened a whole new world for me!These socks are ultra-soft but still structured. What I love about them is they go on smooth, pull up easily and then stay up all day long. They dont start to roll on the upper rim or fall down. I think getting the right size is very important, I got a size M/L I have a larger calf. The material is breathable and moisture wicking. My calf doesnt get sweaty after 12 hours and there are no imprints or marks where the socks were.The best part about these socks though is of course the ADORABLE butterflies. I am forced to wear this super BORING nurses uniform to work and get NO choice in individuality. There is no SOCKS dress-code though, so I pop these on under my scrub pants. When I lift up my pants leg, its SUPER fun and makes everyone smile. I get so many compliments on these and everyone always asks where I got them. 5/5 stars for materials, functionality and quality!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the HiPZiPP Top Quality Running Workout Fitness Belt, fits IPhone 6 + and other bigger phones, Runner Waist Pack, Running Fanny Pack, Travel Pouch.This is a trendy running belt. I need something when I am out and about to carry my cell phone, keys and chapstick! This belt is the ticket since its non-restricting and able to carry quite a bit of stuff. I can get everything in here and it stays smooth under my clothing!I am a size 16-18 and got the X-LARGE. It first perfectly around my waist. I also love how this running belt comes in SO MANY colors! I got the neon pink to match my compression socks I wear and my workout clothing. This belt is not just for working out though, you can wear it for travel with your passport and money (for security), walking the dog (with poop bags and your car keys), or just going to the market and you dont want to carry a bulky bag. This belt goes on perfectly UNDER my clothing and doesnt show. However, since it is so fun, if you are wearing work out clothing, just put it on over and its adorable!I love how many pockets this belt has You can put multiple things in different places for a smoother look. Just like in the photograph on the listing, I put my cell in the front pocket so I can listen to music easier. The other pocket is my car keys and money.I would say this is very true to size and a well-made belt. 5/5 stars for quality, craftsmanship and functionality!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the [NEW Version] ZHPUAT 180 Degree Projection Alarm Clock, Snooze, Colourful Screen LED Backlight, Date, Temperature, Humidness, Week, Alarm Status, Both.This is a bright and vibrant clock with projection capabilities. I got this because I love waking up at night and not having to struggle across the bed to see what time it is. I can simply just look straight up and see the time.The projection on this is VERY clear and works well. The numbers are easy to read with a quick glance, and the numbers are bright. They are red, so they dont disturb your sleep in a dark room. Also, the little handle projection knob is repositionable, so you can turn it onto a wall for reading or leave it on the ceiling. You can also move it around if the numbers get too far away.The face on this is VERY bright. I find it way too bright for my bedroom, I love a dark room at night, and this panel is almost as bright as an LCD TV. Also, it doesnt help that is has this weird moving temperature bar on the bottom that cannot be locked into a solid visual. It is constantly cycling through the bars. It distracts me at night. Since I love the projection numbers on this so much, and want to keep it in my bedroom, I have changed how I use this clock. I put something in front of the main panel at night and it darkens the whole unit so I can use it accordingly in a dark room.The temperature gauge is also way off. It said my room as 95 degrees, and it was 72 degrees. I am not sure what temperature it is reading maybe internally in the unit? I didnt get it for the temperature though, so I let this slide. I wish it was just a clock + projection without all the fancy moving temperature bars and inaccurate temperature gauge. Then it would be perfect! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Pacifier Clip - 3 Pack - mooi baby - 2-Sided Pattern, GIRLY design, Quality Hand-made Pacifier Holder Leash and Clip - Great for Pacifier.These are fun, bright pacifier clips from MOOI baby. I got these for my best friends newborn. The pacifier is always getting lost in the stroller, baby seat chair or at home somewhere. These friendly clips attach to babys clothing or to whatever you are using to hold baby in with elastic and keep the pacifier close.I love these clips because they are unisex. There is a lot of pink but a lot of blue as well, so any baby could use these. The colors are so vibrant and bright. And the sewing is straight and well stitched. These are very durable and sturdy. They can be washed and set out to dry and they will look as good as new. The clips on the end attach well and are safe. There are no sharp edges or hardware that would hurt your baby. They are also easy to use and come on and off with ease.We love these baby pacifier clips and know you will too. 5/5 stars for craftsmanship, materials and quality!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Zero Point - Compression Performance Calf Sleeves Ox, Bright Pink, Large.These are extremely soft well-made compression socks. I am a busy nurse and on my feet for 12 hour shifts at a time. I have taken my pedometer with me to work and I clock in six miles on an average shift! My feet and legs are BURNING at the end of the day. Then I started to wear compression socks to see if it made a difference since I was seeing other nurses with them. It has made a HUGE difference and these Zero Point Compression sleeves do the trick!I love the wear the sleeves sometimes because you can wear your own socks on the bottom. I love super soft socks and these keep structure to my calves but allow comfort as well. At the end of the day, my legs are not AS tired as without these! Did you know that blood ends up pooling in your lower extremities if you dont wear these compression stockings to encourage blood return? The valves in your veins have a hard time, and you end up with tired legs, varicose veins and other problems. These really put the needed pressure on your veins to get the blood moving!The material of these is ultra-soft. It is also nice and moisture wicking. Heaven knows how much I sweat on an average shift running from station, to door to stock and med rooms! These keep my calves dry and supported at the same time! 5/5 stars for materials, functionality and quality!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Runners Calf Compression Sleeve (Pair) - Shin Splint and Calf Pain Relief - Men, Women, Athletes and Joggers Calf Guard - Accelerate Recovery.I got these really incredible compression sleeves since I am a nurse and on my feet for 12 hours a day! I carried my pedometer with me to work last week, and it turns out I walk/run to patients rooms and all around 6 miles a shift! No wonder my feet and legs are BURNING by the end of the day!I am a larger girl so I got the size large which fits perfectly. These pull on smooth and dont snag or roll down. I had suspicions they may roll, but they actually stay perfectly smooth and up on my legs during the whole 12 hours I work. Its a miracle! And the fabric is so nice, it is moisture wicking and allows my skin to breath while still maintaining pressure. I need seven pairs of these for all week long!Did you know that if you are on your feet all day long, the valves in your legs have trouble with venous return of your blood? It starts to pool in your lower extremities and that leads to varicose veins, tired legs and a host of other problems. These encourage blood return, so your legs stay equally distributed if you are walking, running or whatever else. These are technically great to wear in all occasions. You can save your feet and legs from so many problems if you just simply put these on under your clothing every day.I got the bright pink color since I have to wear a boring uniform. The pink is a flash of fun when I lift up my pants legs I get so many compliments on them! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Authentic Graduated Compression Recovery Socks for Sports and Running (L-XL, Pink).I purchased these well-made compression socks because I am a nursing and am on my feet for 12 hour shifts a day. I carried my pedometer with me last week to see how many miles I go in an average shift: six was the approx number!!!!!!!These socks come in a plethora of fun colors. I got the pink because I am forced to wear a boring nursing color of scrubs, so the pink under my uniform makes me feel feminine and girly! And every time I see my feet, I smile. Also, I get a lot of compliments on the fun color if I pull my pants legs up! These socks go on easy unlike a few of my other pairs of compression socks.The compression on these are firm but not TOO much. They are great and help with venous blood return. When you stand for long periods  blood flow may have a hard time getting back past the valves in your veins on your legs. These help with the pressure and encourages blood return resulting in a less tired leg. These socks worked very well. They did not leave unsightly marks on my legs from the fabric, and the fabric is moisture wicking and soft.Overall, I would give these 5/5 stars!

There is a seconds hand and the time is very accurate.The banding is links and they form to my wrists perfectly. The gold accents on the silver are very modern.

" 7:37 MinsThis review is for the Organizedlife Brown Mirrored Jewelry Armoire Cheval Floor Cabinet Organizer Storage with Drawer.This is a beautiful, sturdy jewelry armoire from organized life. The armoire does not hold all my jewelry but that is okay, it holds a good portion of it. I have a crazy amount of stuff  and I think I really need a second one!The whole unit came boxed to me within 2 days from amazon. The unit was in gorgeous condition inside the box  it was packaged well. The unit comes flat and you put together the stand and then attach the mirror part. It comes in hardware in a little bag and an instruction manual. It took me a total of 10 minutes to put together. No tools are needed  it comes with an Allen wrench and you can hand crank the screws in.The wood finish is very smooth and scratch free. The mirror is beautiful and shiny. The cabinet opens to reveal a black velvet jewelry storage system that actually holds a TON of stuff. It does not fit all my necklaces and that makes me sad. It also holds a lot of chunky jewelry which you can see in the video. The unit has earring slots, bracelet holder, hooks for bracelets or hoops, ring slots, necklace hooks, little slots of jewelry such as watches and other bracelets that dont fit on the hooks, and two drawers at the bottom.The door closes well if you dont have anything blocking the bracelets or necklace area. The whole thing locks with a silver key which comes with the unit. It is antique and very pretty. Overall, I love this unit. It is study, well-made, beautiful in craftsmanship and holds my jewelry secure and without damaging it. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

My wrists no longer hurt thanks to this unique and fun bracelet!The bracelet is extremely shiny and beautiful copper. I am a red head and get SO MANY COMPLIMENTS on this bracelet since it matches my skin and hair perfectly! The magnets are nestled in the underside banding. They touch the part of your skin, nerves and muscles that would hurt the most from spending long hours at the keyboard. You can sort of feel them working when you put it on. It is a sensation I have never experienced and very unique.The bracelet goes on easy and comes off easy. I would think this is pretty waterproof so you could just leave it on. Also it sort of forms to your wrist with pinch sides. It doesnt turn around on your wrist which is nice if you secure it just right. 5/5 stars for craftsmanship, beauty and functionality to therapeutically alleviate problems!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HYRW1N9GGYCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149US67U#wasThisHelpful","R1HYRW1N9GGYCG","AOADTSGQ0CULN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOADTSGQ0CULN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Victoria Featherlight - The Body Wrap Kit for Weight Loss, 8 Pieces for Cellulite, Arms, Detox Body Wrapping with Volcanic and Herbal Clay Wrappers.I got these body wraps because I didnt want to spend the RIDICULOUS prices that one company ItWORKS was charging for their wraps. These are exactly the same and an absolute steal at the price the company is asking.The box comes with 8 wraps and envelopes with the mix and bandages. There is a little DIY to this whole process. You have to soak the bandages it comes with in boiling water for 10-15 minutes and stir the powder in the envelopes until it forms a paste. Once you have achieved the desired consistency  you paint the mix onto your skin where you are going to place the bandages. It is fairly simple. You leave it on for 45-60 minutes for maximum results. Then take a shower and wash off!You have to reuse the bandages the box provides. You can machine wash them or hand wash them and hang dry to prevent shrinkage. I was able to use all the bandages and I am a fairly large girl. They covered my body just fine.The wraps work well and provided a toned look to my physique. It is almost like wearing SPANX but without the SPANX! I did these wraps before I went out for the night in a little dress and I looked a few pounds lighter. The box lets you know to use these for six weeks straight and then once a month for maintenance. Overall, they are totally worth the price you are paying for the novelty and the fact that these DO work. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Baby Monthly Stickers by Baby Epic | Best Milestones for Newborn Boy & Girl.Love these totally adorable baby milestone stickers for infants! My best friend is having a baby soon and I want to get her some unique things that are totally useable but very cute! These fit the ticket!The stickers are printed on high quality matte paper and come off with ease. They are sticky but not TOO STICKY! That means you could place them on the furniture or clothing of the baby you are taking pictures of  and then take them right off and place them back on the sheet for later use. They are pretty large which is nice! 3.5 inches! It makes a perfect size for babys tummy!These are very vibrant and colorful. I also love how they are pretty unisex so you could use them on a girl or boy. I feel that the 10 month one is sort of masculine  but the rest are fairly versatile.

"This review is for the Herbalosophy Nourish Masque, 2.03 Fluid Ounce.This is a very luxurious and heavy duty mask for dried and damaged hair. I have naturally curly hair that has been died different colors for the last 25 years. I get regular haircuts, wash every other day, and be sure to leave a conditioning treatment in regularly to maintain my curl and color. This masque has really done the trick.The mask is made with wonderful ingredients including Safflower and Camellia oils. This is really what sets this masque apart from other hair products. The oils add extra shine and repair my tresses. I put a palm sized amount in my hands and rub through the ends. I leave it on for five minutes in the hot steaming shower and then rinse out. My hair is left EXTREMELY SOFT and tangle free.The mask has managed to add translucence and depth to my hair color. It actually makes the color stand out more. And my scalp is also less dry. I think this is an all-around amazing hair mask that works great at repair and maintenance. 5/5 stars for ingredients, effectiveness and value for this high end haircare!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the VOROSY Cosplay Wig Women's Long Straight Hair Wigs for Halloween Cosplay Party Costume-Synthetic Fiber Heat Resistant-60cm (Purple).I got this fun wig because when I was younger I used to dye my hair purple all the time. Now I want the fun color without the commitment  and this wig is the way to go!The wig comes packaged nicely and all the strands are perfect and not bent. You can brush it out carefully and smooth it down so its absolutely perfect. The wig is long and straight. It has a special shine to it. The company also offers many other colors  but I got my favorite which is the purple!The wig is SO comfortable to wear! It comes with sort of a banding under the head piece that keeps it VERY secure on your skull but doesnt pull or tug. Also, sometimes I notice with wigs or hats I get headaches if I wear them for a long period of time. This wig does NOT give me a headache. Also, I almost forget it is on! The wig does not itch or start to fall off in the back which is really nice.You can store this back in the box it comes in, or leave it out to ensure the strands stay perfect. Overall, a fun wig at a great price! 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

This set contains the most essential scents for everyday life to keep me going and get me through some stressful situations!This set comes in a cute cardboard box that is IDEAL for storage of the inhalers. Each inhaler reminds me of the VICKS vapor stick you can buy at the grocery store and stick in your nostrils. Each individual inhaler is wrapped in plastic, so you can gift them separate or use them one at a time. I unwrapped all six and kept them stored in the box. The scents included are: inner peace (a patchouli, flower and citrus blend), breathe easy (lavender, tea tree and mint blend), Zen (anise, clove, grapefruit, bergamot, lime and patchouli), mood lift (basil, black pepper, chamomile, flowers and citrus), insomnia relief (flowers, myrrh and basil) and stress ease (citrus, sandalwood and patchouli). Each blend is a perfect mix to create a harmonious synergy that keeps me going in several unpleasant situations..ts amazing what essential oils can do for the body and how they can keep me healthy and happy!I would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative way to build good and healthy habits instead of turning to prescriptions, OTC, food, alcohol or other unhealthy alternatives.

"This review is for the Lover-Beauty Women's Floral Pleated Print Ruffle Lace Up Overbust Corsets Bustiers.I Love the look of corsets!  But buying one online without being able to try it on, gets complicated and risky.  This corset is no exception.  I have purchased from this company before, and knew that they run large, so I sized down two sizes.  I should have sized down only one.  Per the size guide I should have been a XXXL, but purchased a XL knowing that they are adjustable somewhat with the corset lacing up the back.  I can wear this XL but the modesty panel on the back does not quite cover the amount of back showing, so it has to be tucked inside, leaving my back (or a shirt) showing through the laces.  I think that the XXL would have been a better fit.  So just know, you should size down one size from the size guide.The corset itself is very pretty!  The material feels sturdy, the boning has a lot of give to it though.  The front closure takes some effort to close, but you can be sure it wont open up on you.  I was worried that the ribbon would be too flimsy to hold the corset together, but it seems to be holding just fine!  And would be easy to replace with a cord of some kind if I felt the need later on.  The ribbon trim around the top and bottom of the corset give a little extra frill detail to it as well.The sweetheart neckline I have decided works best for smaller busted women.  I am not one of those women, so this corset will have to be worn with a shirt underneath (unless I am not leaving the bedroom).Overall this is a lovely corset!  5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Chef Essential Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls, Culinary Edge Series, Set of 3, Black.These are extremely quality mixing bowls. They come in three sizes and are perfect for every kitchen need. I had the same set of mixing bowls for years and years and thought it was time to upgrade. I am glad I did as these have exceeded my expectations.The bowls are made with ultra-shiny stainless steel that is scratch free and lustrous. They wash up BEAUTIFULLY. They say they are dishwasher safe, however I just hand wash them as they are easy to wash and air dry. The metal dries without water spots and the silicon actually dries super-fast.The bowls are lipped and spouted to make pouring easy. I would never purchase bowls without this feature as it just makes mixing/baking/cooking SO much easier. On the top, there is a super secure and easy to grasp handle. I can carry the bowl all over my kitchen and not worry about it dropping. It also makes pouring easier. The bottom of the bowl has this nice silicon coating so the bowls dont slide and slip. Also, when I throw them in my sink for cleaning, the silicon makes washing them easier as it stays put while I scrub.Overall, I would give these bowls a 5/5 for manufacturing, materials and design. They are perfect for any kitchen uses you may need them for, and I couldnt think of anything else they would need to be improved. They are perfect!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Breast Cancer Awareness Pink Ribbon Rhinestone Pendant Necklace with Beads in Gift Box.This is an absolutely STUNNING breast cancer necklace. I had to get this for a couple of reasons. First, my aunt, who is my best friend, is a breast cancer survivor. But more importantly, I am an oncology nurse and wanted this to wear in memory of the many patients who have touched my life on the floor I work.The necklace is beautiful shade of light pink and the gemstones sparkle in the light. They are faceted perfectly and help into the setting very strong. They will not fall out or become loose. The charms are held on with O links. There is a little pearl and a little crystal that matches the pink ribbon. They dangle perfectly and do not flip around or get lost.The chain is high quality silver and does not irritate my skin or cause itching. It is 18 inches long which is perfect for my neckline. It is easy to put on and take off. It comes housed in a beautiful gift box that is perfect for gift giving. In fact, I am thinking about getting a matching one for my aunt so we can be necklace twins. 5/5 stars for craftsmanship, style and beauty.If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

" 7:04 MinsThis review is for the CST HACKBUTEER [25-Frequency] Multi Speed Sex Toy for Woman, Girls, Girlfriend, Wife (+Free APP).This is an AMAZING womans sex toy with about a BILLION customized settings. I have never seen any adult toy like this, and I LOVE it!The vibrator itself is made with high quality medical silicon which is extremely soft and silky. It is also 100% waterproof. It has a charging port on the bottom, and comes with the required USB cord to charge it up. It charges fully in less than 1 hour.The toy requires you download an app thru the companys website which gives it all the options and settings you can imagine. The app does the following: allows a TON of different vibrator setting modes that are preset. It also has several CUSTOMIZABLE vibrator settings which allows you to set the 3 different motors to exactly what you want and fine tune your preferences. You can save your creations for later use!The app connects with the toy and plays music also. It also has a statistics page which shows how long you used the toys, the settings you used, and the thrusts you made with it!!!This is a pretty amazing toy and has a ton of options that are extremely unique. It is sort of the top toy of all toys, something you wont find anywhere and is a great gift for your special loved one!

" 0:34 MinsThis review is for the Roman Chamomile Essential Oil Ultra-Premium 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade - 10ml w/ Euro Dropper By Avano Botanicals.I collect essential oils and have over 30 in my arsenal. This was surprisingly, one of the only scents I was missing. So I ordered it from Aviano Botanicals because I own some other oils from them. They produce quality products and this lived up to my expectations of the brand.This chamomile has a scent like apples and sweet straw mixed. It is absolutely lovely. I have constantly used lavender EO for all my calming needs up to this point. From now on, I am going to create my own synergy of chamomile and lavender maybe with a drop or two of eucalyptus for the ultimate sleepy time diffusing tonic.The oil is thick but not so thick it will clog your diffuser. It comes in a good sized bottle with a built in dropper. The scent on this is strong so you dont need much. This particular bottle has given me many nights of peaceful sleep, helped to alleviate depression, and calmed me immensely before work and school. 5/5 stars for ingredients, scent and quality.If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Frostfire Rechargeable Mooncandles Colour - Colour Changing Flameless Candles with Timer and Remote - 4/5/6 inch.These are very nice rainbow candles which work great. They come with the included rechargeable battery casing which makes life easier for me. There are 3 candles of varying heights and a nice plastic base which keeps the candles contained and you can move them around easier and pop them in and charge them right there.The candles are made with a beautiful, real wax and look extremely realistic. There are a couple modes with these candles which I love. The remote control makes using the lighting feature easier. There is normal just glow mode, and then a calming, flickering mode which looks like real candlelight.The remote changes the candles to several different color choices. You can select them all to be one color, or if you want a different color on 1 candle, move it away from the bunch, aim the remote, and change just the solo candles color. There is a color for every mood. You can also cycle the colors with one setting.These also have a nice timer function so I can turn them on before bed and they are off in the morning. I set the eight hour mode for sleep. There is also a nice four hour mode for evening.

"This review is for the Wireless Weather Station, Amir Indoor/Outdoor Wireless Digital Home Weather Forecaster Station with Thermometer, Humidity, Weather Forecast, and Clock.This is a well-made weather station. This station is accurate. I have compared it to my other items that read the temperature and it is almost exactly the same in values.The unit comes with an indoor/outdoor remote that works from 5M. I have found that I can place it on my balcony and it will transmit effectively to the station which is in my bedroom. I love the station unit. Not only is it sturdy and sits on my desk well without falling over  the panel has nice large, dark numbers and readouts which I can see across the room. This would be easy for someone to read that has trouble seeing as its not blurry or small.The weather station has a few values which you can change. You can pick 12H or 24H time. You can also pick C or F. The station reads the indoor and outdoor temp, the date and day of week, the time, a graphic which shows what type of weather is happening in your local area, the humidity and also the moon phase which I am still sort of confused about I guess its an added bonus.The station requires batteries which are not included. The batteries in my unit are still going strong which suggests this unit makes efficient use of power. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know their weather and wants an easy to use unit. 5/5 stars!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Stir Fry Sushi Slicing Food Playset with Wok.This is an adorable kids sushi kit that is excellent for both males and females. If you want to train your little one to love unique food at a young age, and be cultural, this is definitely the set to purchase!I got this set for my best friends little girl. I couldnt resist the vivid and bright colors of the sushi and Japanese food items that are featured in this set. I also love that this set comes with plastic chopsticks, utensils and a knife. The chopsticks can teach a child at a very young age to use these difficult to conquer eating instruments, and I would imagine the child would want to actually learn because their favorite toy set features them.The set comes with a black plastic bowl that all the food pieces can be stored in or the child can play with. The kit is the perfect size for little fingers. It is also appropriate for 3+ but with parents supervision  I would figure you could use this a bit earlier their 3 years old. The set is made with a sturdy, hard plastic. All the pieces could be washed with soap and water and they would remain perfect. You could also bring this set in the bath tub and most pieces would float.The broccoli can be cut into two pieces, teaching your child to learn to cut properly at a young age. Overall, this kit is 5/5 stars for uniqueness, quality and fun!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Luseta Coconut Milk Shampoo & Conditioner Set 2x16.9oz.Mmm, the thought of this shampoo and conditioner pair makes me immediately want to drink the container, but I am smarter than that. I got this because I know all the super beneficial and amazing effects of coconut and I constantly use coconut oil treatment on my hair to lock the moisture in and keep my strands soft. This set aids in the repair of my hair and keeps my tresses clean.These are sizeable containers and you only need a little bit to get hair clean. The conditioner I use about a palm sized amount and run it through the ends and leave it to sit for a bit. When I wash it out, my hair is SO SOFT and SO CLEAN! I have been using this approx a week now, and my hair is already shinier and stronger. I wish the company made a coconut milk mask for weekly treatments.The shampoo and conditioner appears safe on my color treated hair. It is not fading the color or making it dull. In fact, its adding dimension and depth to the strands, so I think its making it look better. The scent is very nice on this and these bottles will last a long time. 5/5 stars for effectiveness, ingredients and quality.If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

"This review is for the Luseta Beauty Macadamia Hair Oil Treatment, 4.09 Ounce.Not only does this hair product SOUND ultra-yummy  I know the crazy, healthy benefits and powers of using products infused with oils in your hair. Apparently macadamia oil is known for its UV protection, ability to infuse the hair shafts with moisture, and create a tangle-free, frizz-free look to your daily hair styles.This hail oil lived up to its hype and provided my hair with a glossy shine, nice scent, and allowed my curls to turn from the occasional dread locks to a perfectly separated, bouncy strand with each use. Every day I use a dime sized amount and leave it in my hair throughout the day. I have a lot of hair and this amount is perfect for what I am using it. There is no greasy, oily strands and it absorbs in perfectly.I love that it is safe to use on colored hair. I have used a lot of hair products which fade my color faster, and this just prolongs the color and coats it with UV protection which actually prolongs the lifespan of the shade. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an effective leave in hair treatment which smells great and works wonders. 5/5 stars for quality, ingredients and effectiveness!If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDPQDYFTVKV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIOM18G#wasThisHelpful","R1VDPQDYFTVKV2","AOADTSGQ0CULN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOADTSGQ0CULN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bikini bottom has several key features, which may it a solid purchase, if you are a bit shy or conservative like myself!Fitment:I purchased the size 10, as that is the size I have been fitting into recently. These fit as expected, with them being maybe a little snug. However, I think they are snug by design, and it is what I was looking for. Tight enough not to fall down, but not so tight it develops back or belly fat/rolls. Since I am VERY shy and sensitive about my figure, it was important that these help hide my problem areas, and not make them worse! Overall - A+Quality/Comfort:The material is very comfortable. Similar feel to that of a sports bra. In addition, the stiches are very well done and hidden, with no loose threads upon arrival. Overall - A+Price:While these are very nice, the price point was a bit high in my opinion. Similar type bottoms can be found cheaper, however, I am unsure of the quality. Even so, they do seem like they could have been sold at a slightly cheaper price, based off of the design/material. Overall - BCoverage:My bum hangs out just a tiny little bit in the back, but it doesn't really bother me. The vast majority of my rear is covered, so I am OK with the little extra that doesn't get covered. The front covers everywhere I would want, without me looking like I am from the 50's. Overall - A+Summary:This is a solid purchase if you are conservative or trying to hide a little bit of your problem areas, without standing out at the beach. While they are a little on the pricey side, I would have zero hesitations buying another pair (if I went to the beach enough to justify it). The pictures do it a decent amount of justice, however, they are a little snug. Overall - AI hope this helps you make a decision. Please feel free to reach out with any questions that you may have. Enjoy the summer! You deserve it!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R163SMSDZFHET8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEXG7C2#wasThisHelpful","R163SMSDZFHET8","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was offered free of charge in return for an honest review of the product. It just so happens I found it to be amazing. If you look at my other reviews, you can see I do not say that about everything I review. Let's get started:Initial packaging and set up:The product comes neatly packaged in a 2""x7""x10"" box. Inside, one can find everything they need securely and properly packaged. The professional display of this products components and accessories instantly made me have more faith in a product that would touch my beloved dog.Included was:1 Handset2 Collars (plastic)2 Receiver units (vibrate/shock/light/sound functions)1 Charger1 Tester1 Instruction guide2 sets of additional prongs for the receiversUpon reading the included instructions, the 10 or so parts are very simple to put together. I very quickly was able to connect the charger to both the handset and one receiver unit at the same time.After charged, it only took a few moments to set the receiver unit up inside one of the two collars (black/orange) and begin to test on myself.Functionality:Before even considering touching my dog, I tried all functions of the unit out on myself first (since my baby cant tell my if there is a problem or not).The sound and light functions were very self explanatory and worked as expected, so I did not spend much time working with them. My main concern was the vibrate and shock features. While I am not planning on using the shock feature, since it has the capacity, and mistakes can happen, I needed to make sure I understood its potential. (I have no personal views about the ethics of shock, I just don't think my dog would respond to it as well as vibrate)The vibrate function feels as if it uses the same offset motor that cell phones use (its a motor with weight on one side of the spindle, which causes shaking/vibrating when powered up). With levels of 1 to 100, I started at 1 and worked my way up. Level 1 was hardly noticeable, while 100 was about 3-5x the vibration of a cell phone. I wouldn't expect it to hurt an animal, as I could freely hold it in my hands (with a low pain tolerance mind you). However, there is a zero chance any dog wouldn't be aware of it past about level 50.The shock function was similar to what I would expect a stun gun to feel like. Here is the level feeling I got:Level 1 - Could hardly feel it - it also felt like the tips were a little warmLevel 3 - Felt like a slight shock, about half the intensity of a 9v on your tongue (for those of us with questionable childhoods :) )Level 5 - This was now a good shock in my opinion, probably a solid 9v type feeling, enough to notice it for sureLevel 10 - This made me jump. It was enough to tense my muscles in my arm and cause twitching.Level 20 - Remarkably painful. Zero percent chance any living animal would be able to ignore thisThen I went completely all the way up to 100.I will admit, turning the dial up to 100 was daunting, as I looked at the easy to read blue LED screen. At the last moment, I asked my husband if he would hold it for me. Without him knowing what was in store for him, and a minimal background on my experience from the first 20 levels, he freely laughed and took the challenge.After I pressed that button, a slew of profanity emerged from a man that for will ever make me blush. After regaining his composure, and looking at me with a questionable look of disbelief, he conveyed the following message ""That would stop a horse right in its tracks"".One should reserve the top level for their animal until they try it on themselves first, to fully understand the power of it. While my husband did not think it was dangerous, it was clearly uncomfortable as possible.Overall UsageWe have been using this for our dog and daughters dog (who lives with us) between the beep and vibrate functions. It had been doing a good job. We got to level 45-50 on the vibrate for both dogs, which seems to be the sweetspot to not cause discomfort, but enough to get them interested in avoiding it. We have coined the term ""buzz"", for when they are heading too far away or towards the busy street by our house.Final WordsThis was a fantastic solution to a problem we had; keeping the dogs away from the street. Our landlord will not allow us to put a fence up, so we had to think of a way to ensure they stopped. We would rather discomfort them a slight bit, to allow them some off the leash time as well as ensure they don't get hit by a car. It seemed like the best solution, as this collar has done just that.If you have made it to the end of this review, you are clearly invested in your dog's well being and want to make the right choice.  This collar does allow you many choices for training the dog and is not simply a ""discipline collar"". Our dog and my daughters dog are part of the family and we would never want to hurt them. The functionality of this collar allows us to give them a little poke when we are not close enough to grab them.A little trick we picked up it to use the beep function before the other functions. That quickly became enough to get them to slow down and reconsider what they are doing.Good luck and my your dog's live a long and healthy life!To the makers of the Petrainer, I would like to thank you for the chance to review your product and the generous offer of gifting it to me in exchange for my review. I am flattered for the offer and most sincerely appreciative of this fantastic tool!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWX5UTB9ZQDNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6ZHZMI#wasThisHelpful","RWX5UTB9ZQDNK","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am writing this review to hopefully help with your decision in purchasing these gloves.Fitment:The gloves fit pretty much as expected. Its hard to judge hands since there are no measurements, but basically if you are a medium in other gloves, then you will be a medium in these, and so on.Style:Overall I really like how these look. They are much nicer in person. They look very expensive and are very similar to my N face gloves.Warmth:These are super duper warm! These appeared to be like every other glove out there, but we have ben shoveling non stop this winter and these have become my new best friend. Water does eventually seep through the top over time, so I would not recommend these for skiing/snowboarding, but perfectly great for a cold day, shoveling and so forth.Touchscreen:These work like a charm. Both the index finger and thumb have the required additive to ensure your capacitive touch phones and devices will work. The basics of this is imagine the top of a stylus made very thing and then added to the fingers of the gloves. The phone can not tell if you have the gloves on or off, so you will not notice any difference, delay or change in your electronics.Value:These are as good or better than any gloves I have owned, short of very high end gloves for skiing. If you can get these for under $50, I think you are getting a great deal. Plus you get the amazon satisfaction and returns policy. How can you go wrong!Construction:These are made extremely well. There is a strap around the wrist to pull it tight and prevent snow from coming into the gloves, or just cold air. There has not been a stich out of place. After 6 times through the wash, and about 15-20 uses (including 3 times shoveling), they still look brand new. In addition, they have a non slip rubber coating on the palms, which is great if you are going to shovel, or work on the house.Cleaning:I washed these on cold wash and let them hang dry. You will want to be careful with the rubber and additive for allowing your phone to work with these on. I suspect one or two times through the dryer and you will probably have lost a lot of the use of these gloves.I hope this review was helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NIEQDH3BKBUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJOUYKE#wasThisHelpful","R3NIEQDH3BKBUX","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These weights are a bit uncomfortable to use. The plastic handle tends to get quite slippery if you are working up a sweat.Also, with all the other types of non-traditional weights that can be adjusted in total weight, this may not be the best option, as have individual weight total dumbbells are really only required when you have old technology metal weights. These could have easily been made to be the select-a-weight types.The good points for these are that they are well made, are almost exactly the weight they claim (according to my scale) and they store easy.Overall, I probably would not buy these again, but I am not unhappy I own them. If you get a good price, it may be worth buying if you will only need lighter weighted dumbbells.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16D4UBQC5TXL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5KP7YW#wasThisHelpful","R16D4UBQC5TXL8","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am writing this review to help you make a decision on if these are the right pair of pajama pants for you or not. Hopefully you will find this review helpful!These pajama pants are very comfortable due to the lightweight material used, which feel similar to your typical cotton tee shirt.In addition, they fit a little larger/looser than I was expecting. While they still fit, they are a bit baggy. For a snugger fit I would have ordered one size down. However, if you like pants a little more loose when you sleep, then your typical size will be fine.They wash like any typical garment and I have not had them shrink at all from what I can see.Also, they are pretty warm, but not overly hot. About a 6 out of 10 with flannel being a 10 and nylon stockings being a 1.Overall These are a solid purchase if you like the style and design.Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQX4FYTURG17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIY0TNK#wasThisHelpful","R3AQX4FYTURG17","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these sunglasses for around the $50-60 price and they were well worth it. Its hard for me to think of an effective way to communicate the value of these sunglasses, so the best I can say is they ""feel"" like nice sunglasses. They are not like the cheap ones you get at a department store. More like the ones you would try on at the sun hut in the mall.The lenses keep out the sun and glare extremely well and make it easy for me to drive during the day. The nose guards are soft and keep the glasses exactly where you want them.Since I have a more round face, I need sunglasses that have some spring in the arms, and these certainly do. It was no problem to wear them with a large head. However, they still fit my husband who has a longer face.Overall an excellent pair of sunglasses that feel and look great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17FQSPEOPTMJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MEWW4Q#wasThisHelpful","R17FQSPEOPTMJY","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book early from another website I belong to. I hope this review is helpful to you.Pearlman's stories and incredibly descriptive, with an excellent use of symbolism, tone, and some surprisingly cynical surprises.The short stories primarily take place in Massachusetts, with Rennie as the main character in most.I must warn you there are some vivid accounts of some deeply troublesome topics, such as female circumcision. For me this was a bit shocking and far outside my comfort zone. However, it was handled in a tactful way and easy to digest once the initial shock wears off.Overall, the stories are quite intelligent and are based on the simplicity of regular people who experience a shocking or unexpected event/situation. Certainly an interesting, smart, and moving way to spend your time as a reader.My hat is off to Pearlman and hope you found this review helpful. I didn't want to give too much away.

"I hope this review is helpful, as this is the whole reason I am taking the time to write this. I did receive an advanced copy of this book, through another website, and am sharing my review on here as well.Let me start by saying I have read many different diet books, and this is in the top tier of them. Its informative and easy to follow. Basically, DR. Phil doesn't just tell you what to do and what results to expect, but he goes into detail on why. For me, understanding the reason behind things makes it easier for me to motivate myself. After reading this book, I shy away from less healthy foods simply because I can envision the damage they are doing to my body, and not just because I know they are ""bad"".The major purpose of the book is to identify the foods your body needs to ""fuel"" itself properly. Basically, how to put super unleaded in your car, instead of cheap gas that overtime will break down the system. This is done in 3 phases.Phases:These 3 phases are two 5 day and then followed up by a 20 day.Phase 1 (days 1-5): ""Boost"" - You eat every 4 hours, increasing metabolism, with basic foods.Phase 2 (days 6-10): ""Sustain"" -  Same pace, but now adding in more diversity of foods.Phase 3 (days 11-30): ""Attain"" - Same pace, but by now all foods have been added in.Foods:The approach to food is simple. Dr. Phil knows that we simply can not eliminate foods forever. So what he does is just have you ""put them off"" for amounts of time. This allows you the comfort of knowing you will eventually have that piece of cake or other goodie you love. However, since he is keeping it space out, you have controlled ""slip ups"" and only end up having these treats a harmless amount of times over the course of the program, or however long you choose to live your lifestyle this way.Overall I think the program and goals are obtainable. Out of all the books/programs I have tried, this is one of the few I have been happy doing, and personally bought into. I understand the reasoning, can handle the program and am seeing results!!!Trust me when I say get this book. Its not expensive, and at minimum it will increase your health and make you loose a few pounds. At best, you could make an entire lifestyle change and see dramatic results!!!I wish you all the best on your journey to physical change through diet. Keep in mind we are all beautiful and you can reach any goal you set your mind to. Keep the faith in yourself!!!I hope this helped!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKTPLA7R3SO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939457319#wasThisHelpful","RZKTPLA7R3SO6","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these as a Christmas gift and thought I should offer some advice to help anyone considering making the purchase.Pros:They are super soft. Almost cashmere soft. I'm not an expert on fabric and thread counts and such, but however they made these, it's made them super soft.Also, you will not have an issue keeping warm. Typical with hat and mittens like these, the heat is kept in well. You'll find no difference here.Cons:We did find a stich that needing fixing on the hat. I did fix it myself quickly, but it may be enough to deter other buyers. It wasn't a major issue at all, just a end stich for the seam. Looks like they didn't back over the track and simply used an end knot.Cosmetically they are a bit boring. I doubt anyone will be thrilled to pull these out of the closet and add to an outfit. They just look like every other pair I have and previously owned.My summation is that these are not bad at all, but will quickly enter the world of other forgotten gloves, hats, scarves, and so on. They are not bad at all, but not great enough for you to have a feeling one way or the other.My recommendation is only buy these if your drawn to the way they look. If the style does it for you, I'd grab them.

Not tight and hangs very nice on my body.Material is polyester, so it's not the most breathable, but it doesn't get overly hot to sleep in or walk around the house in.I just toss it in with the rest of the laundry and have had zero issues in that area.Material is very smooth and light on the body. I can only compare it to having a ""summery"" feeling, if that makes sense. It's just really comfortable and relaxing to be in.It's really lovely and well made. Lots of small little nuances make it seem not so typical. The stitching is also top notch. Not a thread out of place.Overall a safe choice if you like these. I'd order a size bigger than you need to have a little more ""flowy"" feel, but that's just my opinion. Standard sizing will fit you just fine.I hope this review was helpful, as I tried to think what I would have wanted to know.You will be most happy with this purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTLG59P1C29O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK9OX64#wasThisHelpful","RRTLG59P1C29O","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hope this review gives the info to make an informed purchase.My body type is not magazine worthy to say the least. I've got a heathy layer of insulation for the winter and I'm happy with that. However, these underwear are not the most flattering on my body type.My backside kinda hangs out the sides in the back a bit more than im comfortable with, and doesn't get any extra ""lift"" at all. It should have been clear from the pictures, but I figured there would be some tension in the back, but there's none.The band around the top fits like a glove and just the right amount of tightness where they are secure but not tight.The material is comfortable and the style is very pretty and feminine in person.These are very similar to the pairs you would get at VS, and similar sizes as well. You may be able to get a deal on here and no one, including you, could tell the difference between these and VS.Overall I like these, and only took the star away because I felt a bit more info on the body type these are for could have been helpful. Maybe that's silly, but I wish there was a note somewhere saying these really offer zero support.I hope this helps you make your decision. They are very comfy and got perfect. I guess I'm just not built for this specific style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULHVX2WK2E56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCDEUC2#wasThisHelpful","R2ULHVX2WK2E56","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"when making a Jewlery purchase I care about a few things the most. Quality, size, weight, appearance, price. Hopefully going through each will be helpful for you.Quality - This is very well made. The clasp seems like it's ready for years of use, with an almost hard to pull lever, making me know it needs to be broken in. Also, each section is spot welded together, instead of cheaply glued. This looks like it will stand the test of time and several tosses on the top of your dresser at night.Size - This is certainly chunky. It's going to look best on a low cut top or tank. It spans the majority of my upper breast plate area. There's no way anyone would miss this dramatic statement.Weight - it's slightly heavy. Not shocking but heavy enough to notice. I didn't put it on a scale, but it feels like having my cell phone hanging from my neck. You will be able to forget it's there, but it's not light enough not to notice at first.Appearance - the pictures don't do it justice. The color is so deep and attractive. The design and overall appeal is enough to garuntee at least one person in the mall approaching me about it. You can't miss here!Price - I got it for around 250, which was the top of my price point. However, it's well worth that price tag. The overall quality and joy I get from it are worth more than that price. Anything over and Id wait for a sale.I hope this helps! Overall I'd say go for it and enjoy this necklace!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1NXR07DS9RQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2QVMSW#wasThisHelpful","R1J1NXR07DS9RQ","AY62GGSKX9YH4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY62GGSKX9YH4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hope my review is helpful, and I will try to provide the info I need when making a purchase.These are very similar in quality to VS. If you didn't see the tag, you probably wouldn't know the different.They fit exactly the same as VS and how I would expect them to. The quality is very high, as typically I am underwhelmed with thin see through underwear like these. However, these don't feel delicate even though they look that way.The cut is surprising complementary to the body, without any issues of riding up, or leaving lines to be see through your pants.They are snug where they should be, and a little looser on your rear, which is good in my opinion. No fear of a dreaded wedge.Overall I really love these and can't wait to grab some more.

"This stylish hooded sweatshirt is the ideal option for that young girl looking to stay warm and be stylish yet presentable.The soft cotton construction not only allows for easy washing, but doesn't make you overheat if you wear it for a while.My absolute favorite part is the cut of the sweatshirt. It fits true to size in addition to the hood not giving you that strange point at the top when you wear it.

"I hope this review is helpful, as I wish I had this information before getting these.They do their job and they do it well. All the white wine we serve stays cool much longer, probably twice as long. However, they just look and feel cheap.You should consider these good for a cook out. So if that's your level of comfort, they are perfect. They are great when the girls are over in the backyard for a few drinks and laughs.However, they just won't do the job for those slightly nicer dinners where we have our ""fancy pants"" on.If your like me and don't really care about drinking from mismatched glasses and eating takeout in the backyard, these will get the job done.

"these were a Christmas gift and I love them so much I had to write a review to help you make the decision!First of all, these are big. Much bigger than I am used to. They are about the size of a nickel, which for me is pretty big. However, they are lovely and the size is probably necessary to really appreciate the deep purple coloring.These are really great for either everyday use or a reason to get dressed up. They are not too heavy on my ears, and the hooks are at a perfect angle.I get compliments all the time on these and a lot of ""those look expensive"" comments lol.

"Mary Casanova does an amazing job putting together an easily read book for young women, while making it fun and delivering a positive message.Overall the book is about choices, teamwork and responsibility. It follows the leads choices when tackling hard problems with a business, friends, family, travel, and a dog.These topics are mearly analogous to problems we all will face as young adults. Is it worth taking on added responsibility for added success/happiness? How do I deal with group dynamics? Am I a leader? How to I handle failure?This book couldn't be any more positive and fun!

"For those of you not familiar with the back story, Ben Franklin (yes, the inventor Nd founding father) had done a lot of creative writing in addition to inventing and working towards the independence of the USA in the 1700s.One of his works was trying to indentify the virtues a person would need to exhibit to achieve almost a transcendent, pure, and ideal way to live. These are things like patience and humility.Think of the opposite of the seven deadly sins.The books goes through each one and delves into them, while keeping the authors message in small, digestible pieces.Overall, this book gives the reader a clear understand of Ben Franklins 13 virtues as well as some interesting thoughts on his motivations and what the sum of them bring.Overall a great, light, easy read.

"This cookbook is one of the best I have ever owned. It's clear, consice, and easy to follow.The vast majority of dishes are accompanied by clear photos, so you can at first glance decide if your in the mood for it.All the details are contained for each dish as well, not just ingredients like some other books, but times, step, and helpful little tips and tricks (like fold instead of kneed).My favorite part of the book is the high health level of each dish. The foods called out for are unprocessed and low in fat/sugar.There are however a lot of recipes youd expect: lemon chicken, veggie stir fry, fruit salad, etc. Which is why I removed a star. However, there's loads more I haven't tried all in one easy to follow place.Overall I say it's a safe bet.

"let me start by saying, this set is really beautiful and a must buy! Here's why:Construction:The coat and pants are really, really well made. Not a stich out of place and feels higher end than I was used to. The shirt is also really nice, but doesn't feel like a 10/10 as the others, but still an 8/10 and great. The shirt we got did have a couple loose threads, but not a huge deal.The shirt and pants are cleverly made from cotton while the coat is polyester, keeping baby cool when in the house and having the coat off.Upkeep:The shirt and pants are ready for a mess! Spit up, formula, anything. Just toss them in the wash with everything else, since they are made from all 100% cotton.The coat is polyester, so while you can still machine wash it, just be sure to put it on the correct settings when you do. We hang dry ours, but that's up to you.Cosmetics:I can't say enough. The pictures on Amazon don't do it justice. It have some little touches on the ends and neck line that make it really uncommonly nice.Looks beautiful in little girls and still nice on boys, but maybe a touch feminine.Fitment:Fits a little loose on a 10lb bundle of joy. I'm assuming they have a decent amount of time before this becomes a hand me down!Easy to get on, no funny pulling of arms or stretching over the head. Just well made!Price: price point anywhere under 75 is good in my opinion. While it may seem a lot, your getting 3 pieces, with one being a coat. It's also warm, comfy, and fits right. It's similar to other high end brands you would find at the mall.Overall I say buy this. If it's a gift, you'll look like a master of baby gifts! It's 3 seperate pieces making a beautiful outfit!

"This is a no frills, easy to use way to just get rid of nose hair. You put in the batteries, and your good to go. Just put it in your nose, hit the button and in 15 seconds your done.This really doesn't do much for any other spots like your ears or eyebrows, unless you are planning on spending a long time feeding hairs in one by one.Overall it's awesome at the low price point. I have a spare in the glove box since it's so small and I tend to grow nose hair faster than I do on my head. If only it would fall out of my nose too!!Give this a shot.

"Tired of the same old breakfast coffees but want a light roast? Look no further!This coffee has a really nice taste, similar to what you would expect from a drive through coffee store. I'm used to the DD coffee in the morning, and this is really close.This coffee is not overly caffeinated and very smooth. A great morning and all day coffee.No cons here.

"I have this shower with corian-type walls. It was here when I moved in. While I like it very much, it is difficult to hang anything on. Suction cups always slide for me, especially in the winter. I don't know if it is because the cold reduces their flexibility or what, but my old baskets were a total pain. I hate those over the showerhead things, so I was stuck. I really didn't want to drill through that material.This item is very nice. Big...so both my daughter and son can have their products here including a razor (super nice that they included a hook for that!) and some hooks for the poof things. The only trouble was that I didn't want to use the included adhesive. I worried that if I ended up not liking this or it broke, I would be stuck trying to pry the thing off the wall.What I did was use 8 large Command Water-Resistant strips instead of their adhesive. I put two on the bottom of each mounting area and two upside down near the top of each side. That way, I still have access to the removal tabs if I ever do want to take it down or move it. Be sure to follow the directions with cleaning using alcohol first. And I let mine sit there without the refill bottles for 24 hours. Then I added the bottles and filled them. Perfect!I also had some trouble with the pumps not wanting to dispense. I pumped the shampoo about 30-40 times before it came out. And the body wash still isn't coming out (I just put it up today.) I counted 100 pumps and gave up. I may dump out my body wash and try water first, then add the wash back. It's weird because the body wash is actually thinner than the shampoo...so it seems like it should come out.The item isn't super high-end thick polycarbonite and steel. The middle is metal, but the bottles are plastic and chrome colored plastic. It looks nice though and is super functional. I used to have one of these at my last house (and of course used their adhesive and didn't bother trying to remove it when I moved!) That one didn't have removable bottles and it was a little bit of a pain to fill it. I really like that these come off (although I did knock one off accidentally TRYING to pump it.) Remember to just push, not push and lift or it will pop off.I do really like that the buttons are on the bottom...sort of like a soda machine. My old one had the buttons on the front, therefore you always needed two hands to dispense. Plus, those buttons weren't easy to clean. This has a nicer look from the front.So far my kids and I really like it. I love that there is room for additional stuff (we seem to have all kinds of products.) I also like that the back was flat for the command strips to hold. I will update if it falls or if I cannot get the other pump to work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYIADZYZTD26J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3O0TI8#wasThisHelpful","RYIADZYZTD26J","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a long time Photoshop Elements user. But let me say right away that I am not a professional photographer or publisher. I am just a hobby-type user. I first used photoshop a few years ago when I was in charge of our local high school yearbook. So most of the layouts were really made by the publisher, and we could upload things (photos, graphics, text, etc.) I did need to sometimes take someone out of a group photo (like kids being in say the Honor Society photo that weren't in the Honor Society) or a hand signal (you know how kids are! ha ha!!)  I like to also make composite photos of my family or create cards (like last year our christmas cards were my family's photos put in a Brady Bunch squares type of setting...you can get the Brady Bunch font online for free, btw! It was pretty groovy.) But my computer died and I needed to get a new copy. So I figured now was the time to look at other products.Anyway, I have also always been a huge fan of Corel WordPerfect. It is such a superior word processing program over any I have ever used, so I figured I might like Corel's version of photo software. Maybe Corel and I just ""fit"" better than other companies. So far, I am right. It does seem to ""fit"" me better. I am not exactly sure how to explain it, but things are placed where I expect them to be...for me it is more intuitive than elements. I realize that my ""intuitive"" is different than other peoples, though.So far I have been just poking around with it (like I said I use this product as a hobby only) and have used the internet and the PaintShop Leanring Center to help me with the features. To be fair, I STILL have to depend on tutorials for elements when I want to do something new (like a gradient fade-type photo I made for a light scribe cd.)  So far I really like the adding text to photos feature much more than the elements version. I also like the one-step noise removal for improving my sometimes crappy photos.Overall, I like it very much. I like especially that it is cheaper than Elements. If you are really adept at Elements, you may not like the learning curve with a new program. I never got super skilled at elements, so as I was always learning that, I can always learn here. Plus it is nice to see the giant having a little competition sometimes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AT0X6S802AHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60D8#wasThisHelpful","R1AT0X6S802AHP","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to wear socks around the house in the winter. I am not a slipper person...mostly because they are too clunky and big. Can't they make slippers more like little shoes rather than big fluffy things? Still, that is just my preference.These fit well, and I like that they don't go all the way up to my ankle. They remind you of those little see-through footie things they sell to wear inside shoes, but these go up a little higher on the vamp part of your foot (you can see by the photo.)  They are thin. Which may be good if you don't want socks to stretch your shoes at all. But if you are looking for warmth or cushioning, they aren't the socks you want. My son has liners made by Vans that have this same low cut and they are thicker. They are called ""socks"" though. I am not sure if there is really an industry standard for those terms, though. I figured I would post this review so people would know. Not as thin as those peds/stocking liners, but not as thick as typical socks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F56U2EJ3DWCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMQAY0M#wasThisHelpful","R1F56U2EJ3DWCG","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design of this is awsesome! My kids love this character and couldn't wait to get this for their bathroom. It took longer than usual to get this (it isn't prime) maybe 2 weeks. It came with little plastic hooks, but I just used the rolling hooks I already was using for the liner. I did keep my liner with this. It is a nylon type fabric, and it says it is waterproof. But I have used other curtains like this, and while they kind of work, they absorb water in the weave, and if you are in there too long, it will drip and come through. It is just as simple for me to keep up the cheap liner with the same rings. That stays in the tub, and this one stays outside. No worries.I did have one problem with this (for which I deducted 3 stars): it isn't WIDE enough. There are only 10 holes in mine! I didn't order a smaller version or a ""shower stall"" one. I got 12 rings with it. But it is only 10 wide. The photo even shows 12 (I counted!) I guess I could have sent it back, but my kids like it so much that I just left the end two as liner-only. It does cover the whole opening of the shower, and the liner curves to protect from water, but still, it should have 12.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D29R92LW1MJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY81AGA#wasThisHelpful","R2D29R92LW1MJS","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a rug for a small space that had nice design, but wasn't overly feminine or traditional. I saw this and thought it might work. When I got it, I was VERY impressed. Nice thick pile and the design is like a modern take on a traditional floral design. Very appropriate for men and women. It does come rolled of course, and the first few days it doesn't want to lay flat. I know you aren't supposed to roll them the opposite way, but I did roll the ends under for a day because I couldn't wait for gravity! ha ha!!It sheds a little at first. Many of my thicker wool rugs do. But but not like some rugs where there are tumbleweeds of wool. Everyone that sees it absolutely loves it and asks me where I got it.

"My son goes through backpacks at least once a year. Cheap ones to expensive ones (although the cheap ones do fail faster.) I don't know if it is him, or if it is just the nature of using something many times a day that they just break. We have the most trouble with zippers. Either they don't pull smoothly and you end up yanking them which misaligns the teeth. Or  they have that flap over them, which I suppose is for water protection, but ALWAYS end up getting caught in the zipper. I was very happy to see that this backpack didn't have that flap. I mean, for our use, he isn't outside long enough where water soaks through the zipper fabric. I like to use packpacks for traveling on short, weekend trips. I don't like carrying a big bag, and if you have to walk any distance to a bus or train, I don't like to lug along a big handheld bag.The bag is nicely shaped and feels nice while wearing it. The items' weight is nicely distributed. Sometimes these backpacks feel like simply square bags with straps sewn on, and they pull uncomfortably. And if you try to just use one shoulder, they constantly want to tip over. This one has also has that back section designed for a laptop. It is nice because you have to be flash your lacy girl things to everyone near you (unless you WANT to! ha ha!!) I don't always carry a laptop, but I do carry other small electronics (like a tablet, ipod, kindle, etc.) On the train, I like to have a drink, snacks for my kids, mints, a little makeup bag, etc.  It is very nice to have a whole separate section for things I want ON the trip and things I want once I get there.Overall, I really like the size and functionality of this bag.

"I have loved Scharffen Berger chocolate for a while. It was acquired by Hershey and I worried that the chocolate might change. I like Hershey bars and kisses, don't get me wrong, but it isn't really complex type chocolate. Scharffen Berger is. But happily, the chocolate that I liked before has NOT changed...still delicious with lots of notes of flavor.I was very excited to see this jar. The jar itself was smaller than I expected...about the circumference of a paint can, but not as tall. Still, it held a PILE of these little squares. YAY!!!  If you have ever bought the little bags of tasting squares, you will realize that this is an awesome price for the amount of chocolate you get. If you haven't bought them, it will seem skimpy for the price...until you taste them and realize you aren't buying a jar of Hershey kisses, but something much better in quality.HOWEVER, as much as it was beautiful and how happy I was with the amount, mine was flawed. I removed the protective plastic from the jar, opened it (and of course ate a piece!) and tried to put the lid back on. It wouldn't fit. Hmmm...it is dang round...how hard can this be?! So I tried again, thinking the candy must have gotten in the way of the lip of the lid. No go. So I take out half the candy and try again. Still nada. Am I crazy? The glass is sort of cut and sanded on the edges, not like that smooth molded edge like a drinking glass. Almost like a wine bottle someone cut. So I look at it...it looks round, there is no lock like a teapot lid or anything. But I spin it and try...and it goes in. Therefore, it isn't round, but lopsided somewhere. Then I try to take it off...and it is stuck. I spin it trying to find that sweet spot where it actually fits...but cannot. So I pull and spin...and I chipped it. Just a little, but who wants to serve chocolate in a chipped glass jar that could cut someone? And where did that chip of glass go? In the candy? DANG it. It is wrapped but only in paper and foil...not sealed. I might chance it with myself and open each one carefully...but not for anyone else. I am very careful with my things and maybe have chipped a plate or glass once every 5 years. I guess with the cut nature of it, the edge was just too fragile.I can't figure why mine doesn't fit. It isn't like glass should warp like wood or plastic. Maybe the molds for the lids and jars aren't perfect. What a shame. I hope other people get one that works. Just be careful with that lid..if it doesn't fit right, don't try to make it fit.

"This moisturizer is very nice. The texture is smooth--almost whipped, and slightly pearlescent. It goes one smoothly and absorbs seamlessly into my skin. This isn't like drug store creams. The scent is very light and floral...nothing obnoxious.  Does it remove wrinkles? Well, the jury is still out on that, I have only had it a few weeks. I can say that my skin ~feels~ very nice. Honestly, in this time I haven't noticed any real ""lifting"" or ""erasing"" properties. I did say it was pearlescent...which may diffuse the light in a way that makes your skin appear brighter and smoother. I am not saying it is glittery---I don't enjoy glitter or even frosty make-up (well I LIKE them, but they don't flatter my no-longer-20 skin!) I took a star away for this product sort of claiming it does more than any product really can (except maybe some prescription.)Is it a nice cream? Definitely. Is it better than cheap stuff? The texture, absorption, and fragrance are. And time will tell if it does improve my skin more than the cheaper stuff. I probably would buy this again because it does go into my skin so nicely, but the price might make me use it carefully and trying not to waste it (like putting it on knowing I am going to shower in a few hours or when I know I will perspire it off shortly doing something.) Some people spend a lot on face creams and things, but I can be kinda cheap. While I enjoy good products, I feel guilty about spending too much. One amazing cream would be worth it...and hoping over time that this might be it.

"I have a large yard, about a third-acre. The previous owner must have enjoyed buying plants, shrubs, and trees. Unfortunately, he didn't apparently enjoy cutting any of those. So when we moved in, it was almost like a jungle in places, you couldn't even see where one thing ended and another began. I started with hand pruners...which was a joke. Then I got those lopper things...better, but it would have taken 3 lifetimes. And I found out I can't swing an ax for crap. Then I used hedge trimmers, but couldn't get the big stuff. I did buy an electric handsaw, and it helped greatly, but it wasn't super fast. I knew I needed a chainsaw, but was afraid of them. I didn't grow up around tools. And men often wouldn't show me because I was a girl. :p I was scared to death to use a drill the first time...but figured it wasn't that much different than a sewing machine! ha ha!!  So I taught myself to use most power hand tools. I still get nervous with big things, mostly because they are heavy and I really am not that strong to handle any kickback or anything.I saw this and thought, ""hey! this is for ME!"" It is electric, which means I don't have to fool around with gas, mixing oil, starters and all that.  I don't know how to do that. And I knew I wasn't going out there to slay the giant oak or be Paul Bunyan or anything (ok he used an ax...)  This is a great size. It is not unwieldy so I can handle it. It isn't obviously the most powerful thing since it is small and electric, but it totally got the job done on cutting down shrubs and getting rid of big branches. I haven't cut down any trees with it, but have some about 9 inches in diameter that need to go this spring. I will update if this doesn't do well with those.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQXR5QU56B6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ3FBOY#wasThisHelpful","R2QQXR5QU56B6C","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son sometimes has problem areas with acne, not super bad, but here and there (especially where his hair/bangs are on his forehead.) He has tried a few things. He does like that this goes on sort of smoothly and without a color or shiny finish. He said he really liked the way his skin felt using it, however...for blemishes, he said that it wasn't much different than much else he has used. I think the price is sort of high for a product like this, and maybe would recommend trying a similar, lower priced product (or two) first. For instance, my son likes the combination of two products I got here on amazon: Topix Benzoyl Peroxide Wash and regular Witch Hazel. His skin seems to clear up well and quickly with those, so he sticks with that. Plus the price is good!For us, the price is sort of prohibitive, so we mostly only be tempted to try this if other over-the-counter items weren't working. Others may feel the price is fair. It does make his skin feel nice, just not enough to justify the price difference. As an aside, if you haven't used this type of medicine (benzoyl peroxide), please know that it will bleach your bath towels. My son didn't know that and his favorite towel has white blotches.

It was so cute!!!The batteries were already installed so all I had to do is start playing. My kids and I played it before even taking off the cardboard!! ha ha!!

It keeps track of the high score which it announces when you start a new game. It also gives you a little reward sound when you get to 100. (I quit after that, not sure if there is another milestone to reach!!) You do need two hands to play....at least I haven't found a way to pull or twist with one hand. But it is nice and small.

"Maybe it's me, but I seem to like different types of fragrances based on the season. I like fruity, floral-y things for spring and summer, and more spicy/musky things when it gets colder. Sort of like how I pick food! (ok, not musky food! ha ha!!)This has some fruity top notes, like pomegranate and persimmon, so you think it might be a sweet light fruity scent, but as time goes on, the low notes start to blossom...they are more vanilla, musk and patchouli. I was sorta hoping that the fruit plus musk/vanilla might hint at the original Dior Poison (which I loved), but it isn't like that...but in the same sort of family, if that makes any sense.  So it is more of a deep luscious scent, not a light flirty one.I do like it very much, but I think I will save it for autumn and winter. My body seems to react better to these type of scents when its cool. Some people can wear these scents in any season and they seem right. If you do buy it and maybe aren't sure if you like it, try it in a different season and see if it changes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVD0H6RPPET0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BIPMC2#wasThisHelpful","RVD0H6RPPET0O","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I leave my table and chairs out all winter. Mostly because it is heavy and I don't really have anywhere to store it indoors. And it snows where I live...I mean piles of snow. I had a different cover that was cheaper, and it was almost like tyvek or something. After one winter, it just wore so thin where it rubbed on the chair backs, it tore. So my cheap item wasn't so cheap anymore since it didn't last.This is one of the higher end items from Classic Accessories.

"I have the MX model (i used to have an older one, but it sort of died after about 5 years.) I used my MX one for about 3 years just using batteries. I finally got this adapter, and the same week I plugged it in, the lid/motor quit. I don't know why for sure, but t worries me that I may have done something to it by switching from the batteries to the adapter. The sensor seems to know to open as the light changes color, but there is no noise, no motor, no nothing.I did just go to the itouchless website and you CAN buy a replacement lid (for about 40 bucks plus 10 bucks shipping) which I did. I am planning on going straight to the adapter with it to see if it messes up the new lid. Hopefully it doesn't happen and it was just a coincidence. If  it DOES ruin the new lid, I will come back and note that in this review.

"The person who had my house before me thought it would be cute to have a paver-brick patio WITH things growing between the cracks. There were morning glories (which are pretty invasive), moss, grass, weeds, etc. in between every single brick. What a mess. Plus all that growth between the bricks prevents them from drying properly after a rain and can even push them out of position.  It looked sort of country rustic I guess, but it wasn't nice to walk on. I was worried that I would never be able to have a regular patio, but took  a chance on round up. YAY!! It worked wonderfully! I sprayed it between all the cracks and now we have a normal place to walk and sit.  I do have a small border of annuals that I plant around the patio and this hasn't effected that at all...only where I spray it. I usually buy two gallons of this to kill stuff between the expansion joints on my concrete driveway and sidewalks. I also use it to kill weeds and anything that likes to grow in my fieldstone border fence. I try to do it before anything gets too established each spring and sometimes I have to do a few spots again in august.  I have tried it on english ivy (which was covering a few of my trees and a small part of my garage (another bright idea by the previous owner.) That stuff is evil! This helped, but it needed to be pulled by hand. I did read once that for waxy things like ivy, to spray it first with a detergent like a Dawn mixture (to break the wax) and then the poison. We managed to get rid of almost all of it (some of the vines were as big as my wrist!)  but every year a few hangers-on want to come back.I also have sprayed it on a few mystery vines and weeds that are trying to take over my shrubbery. I try to get the vines down to a little stump, and then just spray it carefully on that. It works sometimes this way, but other times I think I would need more spray (which I fear doing around my small shrubs) so I just dig.This stuff has really saved me from hours (more like weeks!) of work to try to keep the weeds/grass out of places where they don't belong to avoid damage to my hard surfaces.  I am careful not to spray it on a really hot, sunny day as it seems to dry too quickly without getting a chance to ""seep."" But I don't want to do it right before a rain so it washes where I don't need it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7GK5DFSFJTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZNI2A#wasThisHelpful","RR7GK5DFSFJTR","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a favorite, tweaked chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have been using for years. I like them chewy in the centers, but still a little crisp on the edges. Not cakey, not flat. I have been using Nestle semi-sweet chips for years and they are adequate. I really like the flavor of Scharffen Berger bars, so I knew these would be good. Actually, I like the ""rich milk"" type the best...and I am a dark-chocolate lover! I didn't want to use that though in cookies because I feared the 41% cacao might melt too much; these chunks are 62%.Regular baking chips have less cocoa butter in them to withstand oven heat and still retain their shape. They aren't good for melting though for other uses. These do melt, so I wasn't sure how my cookies would fare. I ended up deciding to use half of these and half nestle (one for melty flavor and one for shape.) My cookies did taste AMAZING, however, they spread too much.The cookies had a nice smear of chocolate from these, and still some visible chips from the Nestles. They didn't spread so much that they were one giant cookie, but enough that they were quite fragile removing from the pan and kind of thin to hold. I imagine it was from the additional cocoa butter melting and thinning out the dough slightly (I am no chemist, just a guess.) I don't know if I would have used ALL this type (instead of half and half) what would have happened. I will have to re-experiment to maybe lessen the amount of fat (butter/shortening/egg) in my recipe or raise the amount of dry ingredients (or even a long chill in the fridge first) to regain my desired texture.I haven't done so yet, but I imagine these would be great for recipes using melted chocolate (like cake or brownies) rather than that weird ""baking chocolate"" stuff. I just wanted to post that if you are using these for chocolate chip cookies you have made with other chips, be prepared for possible changes in your finished product. I will update my review after I figure out what percentage of ""typical"" recipes need to change (if I DO figure it out that is!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XLRQLOKGPYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N5J554#wasThisHelpful","R20XLRQLOKGPYM","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It would be even nicer if the the bottoms didn't have the design too..then they would just like like casual pants. But, the designs are cute enough.

"I bought one of these for my mom, and after it arrived I was so impressed that I had to have one, too!! (I am actually back again to buy another one for a gift.)It is very shiny and the stones are set nicely in the pendant. The ""bale"" (the part where the chain goes through) on the item is not an additional tab like projection as you can see in the photo. It is actually two holes in the setting where the chain is woven in then out. You have to look a little to see where the spaces are wider to know which is the actual area for the chain and which is just the setting. Once you do it a few times, you will know. I have noticed that certain chains bend more easily than others, so you may have to experiment with chains you have to find one you like best. The included one is nice, but I have an adjustable one I like better (so I can change the length.) A thicker chain, thicker cord, or something with bigger links won't weave well through the setting.I just think it is quite unique and pretty.

"I host all the family gatherings at my house every year. I really enjoy it, but sometimes washing all those dishes can get to me. I wanted something nice and pretty that could handle the dishwasher (good china cannot.) I looked and looked at corelle (which I love for everyday) but it never seemed formal enough for holiday dinners. Then I saw this!!! I was really impressed with corelle offering more styles that weren't so casual. These could certainly be used casually, but do have a more formal look.I saw it online and wondered what it would be like. So once at a department store, I found a plate and really liked it. The embossing is really there! It isn't just paint or swirls embedded in the glass...but actual texture you can feel. And the plain white design lends itself just as well with the oranges and browns of thanksgiving linens as it does with pastels for easter. And most chefs agree that serving food on white increases the appeal (and doesn't distract from the food itself.)So I bought them. (I bought just the plates...don't need cups or bowls right now.) But I got 16, so I invested in them! ha ha! (hint: if you sign up for corelle emails, you often will get sale notifications for their site...I waited for that.) I am so excited to use these for thanksgiving. They are characteristically light like corelle always is, but still strong. And they aren't thick, so a stack of 16 only takes up 3.25 inches of height in my already crowded cupboards. Ever try stacking 16 pieces of stoneware!? It is very heavy and is a foot tall at least!!! Plus I have cracked porcelain plates by stacking too high to store them...they crack under their own weight.Additionally, I don't have to worry about scratched paint on dishes, chipped porcelain (which you shouldn't use since germs can get in where there is no glaze and you can't get it out), scratched platinum rims, kids banging utensils on them, using liners between each to store...or any of the other things you worry about with china or stoneware. And the BEST? The dishwasher, baby!! oh yeah! I don't care if I have to run it twice for everything to fit...it is still easier than handwashing all that china. (Tip: if you happen to get those gray lines on your corelle from flatware, Barkeepers Friend cleanser or a light rub with a Mr. Clean magic eraser will talk them off.)The only thing negative (maybe) that I noticed was that since the pattern occupies the rim of each plate, the area for food seems smaller than some other dishes. There is no reason why your food can't sit on the embossed area...it just LOOKS like it is a smaller area. Maybe this isn't such a bad thing...I usually eat too many mashed potatoes anyway! ha ha!! (doubt this will stop me ...maybe someone else might take less, though!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVRPT26K65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKH61C4#wasThisHelpful","R2BVRPT26K65","A3A90CELVLOUP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A90CELVLOUP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom told me once that I shouldn't get rid of lids to pans if they are in good shape (even if you pitch the pan) because you never know when you might need one for an odd pan.I have an older T-fal skillet that came with no lid. Of course ~I~ buy one that doesn't have a matching lid. I thought one I had might fit...nope. And then I figured, ""no big deal"" I will just buy one of those universal ones!"" But unfortunately, those are mostly 12 inches (not 12.5) or huge for paella. I found one that JUST fit...I mean just...but it was flat (I prefer at least a little dome) and the lip balanced precariously on the edge of my pan. And it is really low quality.This one has a larger lip and is slightly larger, so it sits on my pan. I would love one that had a ridge where it fit inside (like most lids do) but it would have to be made specifically for this pan. It isn't as heavy duty as some other lids I have, but I thought it was much nicer than some of the bigger ""universal"" ones I have seen (including one I own.)

"I have a few of these small speakers. I like to listen to music outside in the summer and want an item that is loud enough so I can hear while doing yardwork. So many of them are either too small to project enough sound, or are too big to haul in and out every day. This one is about the size of sausage sandwich (ha ha!) and fits in my hand very well! I have had no trouble tethering it to my bluetooth on my phone or just using the wired jack (on my old pod.) The sound is nice and loud so I can hear it from far away.Now, it of course isn't a giant speaker where you would hold a concert or block party or something, but for its size it is quite nice. I like that it is water resistant because rain can pop up quickly in the summers and I don't always get my stuff away before it gets wet. It doesn't say waterPROOF, so I don't purposely try to get it wet, but it is nice that a some water won't ruin it. We have also used it with our projector when we watch outside ""drive-in"" movies in our yard. Loud enough for everyone to hear, but not obnoxious to the neighbors or a annoying to carry.I agree with some other reviewers that the initial voice prompt is obviously done by an english-as-a-second-language speaker. It is only a few seconds though and I have come to anticipate that female voice saying ""ready for connection!"" in that slightly accented voice. I WAIT for her now!!! :D I also like that it charges with a common mini usb plug...I have a few of these around from other items so it isn't some proprietary charging cord that is impossible to replace.

"I got a Foreman grill years ago (like 15 years ago!!) and l like it very much. I have gotten used to it's shortcomings (no removable plates, a hinge like a book, etc.) so I was very happy to use an improved one!! I used to just heat it up and sort of ""cook"" hot water to clean mine...now I can really wash the plates without using 5 papertowels!! I love that feature. I also love that the hinge accommodates thicker foods. My old one would close tight closer to the hinge side, but the far edge didn't really press down. This hinge seems to fit the thickness of the food well so the cooking is more even.It really has only one heat setting...on. I sort of expected an ""improvement"" where you could change the setting...but realized that I just sort of use one setting. It is like a waffle iron or many other itchen appliances (or even my furnace!) where it cycles on or off with an internal thermostat. So even when many seem like they have different settings, they just turn on and off more frequently. I suppose if you wanted to just keep something warm in this, it wouldn't work well, but I don't do that. You could just leave it open or unplug it or something if you wanted to experiment. I just ""cook"" with mine and the non-temperature setting sort of makes it simple so I don't have to think about if something cooks at 400 or 425 (which I really don't do anyway...even on a stove.)My kids also like it because they can cook things like burgers or chicken breasts and not have to worry about heat settings or skillets or flipping or anything.

"There is no dream thats more of a clich than a young womans dream of living in Paris.Wild parties, suave lovers, memorable encounters with giant intellects? Shes blond and beautiful, but that clich doesnt fit Kate Betts, 22 years old, arriving in Paris in 1986. Shes fourth generation Princeton. Shed written her college thesis on the Paris riots of l968 and the impact of student-worker action on French political consciousness. And shes haunted by her parents divorce when she was six.Her first smart move was getting herself to Paris, where she scrambled for entry-level jobs, missed her college boyfriend, met a sweet young Frenchman and was adopted by his charming family. And then she was hired as a features writer for M magazine and W, the biweekly society paper, both owned by John Fairchild, the publisher of Womens Wear Daily.John Fairchild was an odd kind of genius. He loved fashion, but he loved power more, and he loved the arbitrary exercise of power most of all. The kind word for him was mercurial. I knew him socially and saw something else: a Wizard of Oz who played the bully to keep people off-balance.Kate Betts had a modest sense of personal style and even less knowledge of fashion when she started in Fairchilds Paris office. But Fairchild had also gone to Princeton, and his ferocious attachment to that snobbish credit saved her from his random cruelty. Her ambition, which was considerable, was the more important ingredient in her ascent, and that ambition is the reason My Paris Dream is essential reading for any young woman who wants to become Someone.Fairchild was obsessed with observation, preferably at the distance of inches. Details were huge for him. And atmosphere was everything. When Betts was assigned to a story in Provence, this was his advice: Run through the lavender fields!The most fertile field at Fairchild, she quickly learned, was fashion, and she pushed her way into reporting on it. She stood with Fairchild at Saint Laurents studio, like walking in on someone in their bedroom during an intimate moment. Helmut Lang sketched for her. She collected another, of a Christian Lacroix lace wedding dress. She partied with then unknown Christian Louboutin. And she watched makeup artists transform models.And here we come to the section of My Paris Dream that takes fashion dish and makes it something more, something grander  the section that chronicles the writers own transformation. This is Betts, at 26, in Paris:""I took advantage of my pet status at Fairchild. I disregarded many of my colleagues or pushed them aside, reaching for the best stories, the most bylines, the favored position. A few times I caught them whispering about my cocky, bossy attitude. But I was too young to care, blinded by ambition. I was impatient with people who couldnt speak French as well as I did or couldnt secure an interview with a designer. I bought into Mr. Fairchilds games and favoritism. Deep down I harbored thoughts that perhaps fashion wasnt a serious occupation, that it was something too frivolous to build a meaningful career on. And when these thoughts overwhelmed me, when I daydreamed about becoming a foreign correspondent, I would snap out of it quickly, reminded that fashion was now my ticket to the top.""She broke up with her French boyfriend. Had she made a mistake? Vas retrouver ta famille, his mother told her. Go find your family.Anna Wintour spirited her back to New York. At a Vogue party, she met Chip Brown, a writer with no tendency toward ephemera. At the wedding, he read a poem hed written: Nothing is real that is not first imagined. She was well on her way to becoming the Kate Betts I sort of know: a force field.My Paris Dream is about imagining yourself and making it real.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMF7R7QKHAHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679644423#wasThisHelpful","R1KMF7R7QKHAHE","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fashion Lives is big as a MacBook and heavy as a small barbell, but if you like to read about fashion, youll find it as light as an airport page-turner. Dish? Honey, the dish does not quit. Emotion? Hey, this is fashion, not physics. Intelligence, compassion, ideas? Yes, in quantity, and not so much because the 19 designers, photographers and editors interviewed here are so verbal but because the interviewer is so haimish and well prepared that her guests nearly forget theyre onstage at the 92nd Street YHMA.All praise, therefore, to Fern Mallis, who invented this series and got almost everyone she asked to participate. But schmoozing the talent is the least of it. Doing your homework and getting guests who are usually guarded by a wall of publicists to say more than they may have intended  thats the trick.There are no impertinent questions, only impertinent answers, Oscar Wilde said. Few interviewers today agree; they trade relevance for access. Fern Mallis uses her access to get great anecdotes, and then she slips in a few pointed questions. She gets answers because everyone knows her story  shes been fashions champion for decades. In brief: Mallis was the Executive Director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America from 1991 to 2001. She created Fashion Week, which generated a fortune for the city, before moving on to IMG Fashion and her own fashion and design consultancy. Why no reality TV show? Producers found her too nice. But in this format, a friend talking to a friend yields gems.Among the many anecdotes I marked: Norma Kamali, in the early 60s, worked for an airline and got to fly to London for $29 round trip, and what she saw in London gave her the courage to lease a shop on East 53rd Street  for $285 a month. Mallis asks Calvin: What do Customs agents say when you get back from a trip and they look at the passport and it says Calvin Klein? And Klein replies, with some amusement, Well, I generally dont go through Customs  they get on the plane. Tom Ford, as a kid in Texas, carried a briefcase and wore suits. Michael Kors, on his marriage to Lance LePere: Were probably the only people who got married on the beach, jumped in the jeep, went to Easthampton, had pizza at Sams and saw The Help. Polly Mellen flees a chance for sex with William Holden. Oscar de la Renta gives John Galliano a second chance. Bruce Webers dogs get acupuncture. Bill Cunningham explains why the best time to photograph on the street is 8:30 in the morning.For Fern Mallis, charm begins and ends with a small public ego  so small it would be easy to focus on the bold-face names and ignore the woman who gave them a platform on which to dance. Better, I thought, to shine a spotlight on their enabler. Ms. Mallis, I have ten questions for you.JK: I remember being backstage with Isaac Mizrahi after his blowout show in 1989. His mother was there, beaming. Marc Jacobs joined them. My mother never comes to my shows, he said. And I thought that there, right there, was a major difference in everything these two men did. And you, I see, start every interview with questions about childhood. Why are the early years so important for you?FM: I think we are who we are because of our parents and families, and our early upbringing and environments play a key role. For creative people and designers Im curious what they were surrounded by, and what visual imagery they remember, what helped form their taste levels.JK: You ask every guest about his/her astrological sign. Lets deal with yours. You were born on March 26, 1948, on the cusp of Pisces and Aries. Significance?FM: Aries, with Gemini rising. Im headstrong, a leader, and I start lots of things but dont always finish them.JK: For the designers you interview, Studio 54 comes up again and again. What was its influence on fashion?FM: Studio 54 was the first time any of us had seen gala black tie dressing mix with poufs and roller-skates, jeans and every form of costume available  as well as the barely dressed. Thankfully it happened before social media and everyone in the world partied with a camera in hand.JK: Ive marked revelation after revelation, from Jacqueline Kennedy having the Dallas dress dyed black for the Presidents funeral to Yves Saint Laurents drop-dead letter to Tom Ford (In 13 months, you have destroyed what it took me 40 years to create). What was the biggest surprise for you?FM: Those two are at the top of my list. Add Andr Leon Talley sharing that Karl Lagerfeld gave him $50,000 for his 50th birthday; learning that Marc Jacobs dad, an agent at William Morris, once represented Joan Rivers; that Betsey Johnson was a Phi Beta Kappa at Syracuse University; and that Vera Wang grew up in Peter Cooper Village.JK: In the late 80s, I wrote the CFDA awards shows. They were held in the Rogers Auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum, which seats just 700. The night felt like a family reunion. I know nostalgia is pointless  but are you nostalgic for that pre-corporate era?FM: A little. It was nice when sponsors names werent plastered all over everything, but just supported events and causes because it was the right thing to do.JK: Along the same lines, I kept thinking as I read: If these designers didnt have licenses and perfumes and do second labels for discount stores, theyd all be out of business. Is the pure fashion designer a thing of the past?FM: Close to it. And since so many of them have become public companies, they have to keep making bigger and bigger profits to satisfy shareholders. The high-end collections of most designers are the least profitable. Fragrances and licenses are where they do the biggest business, at price points that make it affordable and accessible.JK: Isaac Mizrahi mourns the death of Loehmanns (That is like global warming.) But theres a new Loehmanns  Gilt. Im fascinated that none of your guests seems to have much interest in the Internet. (The exception is Bill Cunningham: Look at the lines waiting to get into the Apple store on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. Do you see a line waiting to get into Bergdorf or Saks?) Is this generational?FM: Yes. Most of these designers text; social media and Internet presence are for their staff. Bill Cunningham rightly identified the importance of this age of technology  but he doesnt have a computer or a cell phone and is impossible to reach.JK: The most emotional interview for you?FM: Probably Bill Cunningham, as hes the most private. He was quite moved while discussing his family and early upbringing. His was an epic interview, and I could feel his pain at moments. I touched his hand to let him pause several times. And Norma Kamali  weve known each other and have been friends for so long. We shared friends who have passed away from AIDS, and that meant a great deal to me.JK: The most emotional interview for the designer/guest?FM: There were many. Vera Wang talked about having to do her fashion show at the tents the morning after she raced to be with her father who passed away the night before; she cried the entire walk around the runway when she took her bow. Calvin and Marc were very honest about their addictions. When Diane von Furstenberg shared the story of her mothers experience in the concentration camps, you could hear a pin drop.JK: As we used to say in sexy Internet chat rooms: What are you wearing?FM: Donna Karan Urban Zen cashmere sweater and jersey jodhpur pants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIKE14A9FQXMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847844803#wasThisHelpful","RIKE14A9FQXMO","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tibetans are said to believe that if you have a dark thought about someone and the thought does not directly strike that person it will travel around the world and hit you in the back of the head. On this theory, I have spent almost a decade not thinking dark thoughts about Judith Miller, the former New York Times reporter whose reporting about Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction was so useful in the Bush Administrations campaign to sell an Iraq invasion.But in the last few days, Miller has published a piece in the Wall Street Journal, The Iraq War and Stubborn Myths,""  and The New York Times has reviewed her just-published book, 'The Story: A Reporters Journey, and I find myself thinking again about the 4,400 American dead, the hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis, the untold wounded and maimed, the waste of $4 trillion, the connection between the shattering of Iraq and the rise of ISIS, and, not least, the fact that no one involved in the greatest American disaster since Vietnam has been held remotely accountable. So when I read Judith Miller saying, yet again, that a journalist is only as good as her sources, I found my blood pressure redlining.And when I read, in the pathologically cautious Times review by a non-Times employee, that the agenda that comes through most strongly [in the book] is a desire to land on the front page, I find myself transported to an earlier time, when citizens like me ate rage for breakfast. And then I recall an interaction I had with Ms. Miller in 2005 and the question that forced me to write about her.For those who have had the good fortune to know nothing about Ms. Miller and her role as an enabler of the Bush Administrations marketing of the Iraq invasion, heres the briefest of primers.Miller was a dogged reporter whose special knack was cultivating powerful men as sources. Its tricky to write a sentence like that --- you cant help sounding like the pundits who call Hillary Clinton aggressive. But that was, in fact, how Miller operated; Nina Totenberg recalls Jordans King Hussein spotting Miller at a party and shouting Juuuudy! and Miller, in response, shouting Kiiiiiing!Miller was one of the first journalists to be interested in bioterrorism. With her colleagues, she won a Pulitzer and authored a prescient book.  But when Bush became President, her sources narrowed: Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, Scooter Libby. If she didnt have an agenda, they did. They have it still, and if anyone took them seriously, we would have already leveled Tehran.In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, government officials made remarkable claims. Dick Cheney insisted that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had met an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague a few months before Atta flew a plane into the World Trade Center. (That meeting didnt happen.) Condoleezza Rice also saw ties between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. (Despite all evidence to the contrary, Rice was still saying this in 2006.) But the biggest whopper was Millers claim about Iraqs intentions to develop weapons of mass destruction.As an embedded reporter in Iraq, Miller saw buried ingredients for chemical weapons production. Well, she didnt exactly see them. Clad in nondescript clothes and a baseball cap, she wrote in the Times, a former low-level Iraqi scientist known as Curveball pointed to several spots in the sand where he said chemical precursors and other weapons material were buried.A few hours after that piece was published, Dick Cheney went on Meet the Press and quoted Miller. Others followed. Bob Simon, of 60 Minutes, was quick to see through the kabuki. ""You leak a story to the New York Times,"" he told Franklin Foer of New York Magazine, ""and the New York Times prints it, and then you go on the Sunday shows quoting the New York Times and corroborating your own information. You've got to hand it to them. That takes, as we say here in New York, chutzpah.""It took two years for Miller to admit her reporting couldnt be confirmed: WMDI got it totally wrong. But it wasnt her fault; she was deceived by her sources. Well, not even deceived. They meant well. They just got it wrong. Its a defense we hear often. Indeed, its the single best argument against the passive voice: Mistakes were made.By 2005, there were many factual takedowns of Millers reporting. Correctly, they focused on her false assumptions and inadequate reporting. I read none that linked her blunders to her character.Then, about a week before Harriet Miers pulled the plug on her disastrous Supreme Court nomination, Judith Miller went to a dinner party.There, I was told, she had a question: Why is everyone being so mean to Harriet Miers?""It was a memorable question. Miers was White House Council for George W. Bush. She had not one credential that suggested she belonged on the Supreme Court. Her nomination was widely viewed as an expression of Bush's contempt for the Court.  Even Republicans declined to support her. And here was Judith Miller, as if shed been on Mars for months, wondering why Washington was mean to Miers.When I learned about Millers astonishing remark, I decided to write about her. And I wrote her to ask for confirmation.Her response was brilliant weaselspeak.""You're probably going to hear a lot of things that I supposedly said that I don't remember saying,"" she told me, via email. ""Like this. Don't think I ever voiced an opinion on her, or asked the question you raise about Harriet Miers.""I didnt respond, but my source was Don Hewitt, creator and producer of 60 Minutes. I knew Hewitt --- he told me the Miller story while I was reporting a piece about him; a few years earlier, 60 Minutes had bought some research from me. He could be crusty. But he was reliable  he had the greatest track record in broadcast journalism.So if Hewitt said Miller asked that question, Im siding with Hewitt. As for Millers slippery non-denial, it speaks to character --- shes not a good reporter and shes not a good source. Now embedded at Fox News, shes finally found her true home.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EG5IJ8FMY3IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476716013#wasThisHelpful","R1EG5IJ8FMY3IZ","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How often do I read thrillers?Rarely.How often do I stay up until 3 AM, manically turning pages so I can see how a thriller ends?Never.And yet reading until my eyes blurred was exactly what happened the night I read Night Life, by David C. Taylor.As the book opens, a New York cop, Michael Cassidy, has a confrontation on a sidewalk with Roy Cohn, legal assistant to the fearsome Senator, Joe McCarthy. He has no reason to know Cohn. So he is less than respectful. This doesnt fly.Im Roy Cohn.Happy New Year, Mr. Cohen.Not Cohen. Tight with anger. Cohn. Roy Cohn.Well, my congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. CohenWhats your name?Cassidy. Detective Michael Cassidy.Youre going to hear from me, Cohn said,Always a pleasure to hear from a citizen, Mr. Cohen.Right there, on page 23, you know that much is going to go wrong for Cassidy. .Whats in Night Life for you? Great fake tough guy dialogue: You want to go get loaded? I always work better with a hangover. Add an acute sense of a vanished New York, the New York of jazz clubs and men in hats. And vivid characters: Michaels unlikely lover, some dodgy FBI agents and some CIA agents who, of course, are not supposed to be doing any domestic investigations. Violence? Yes, none of it textbook.The secret of a great thriller, Im coming to realize, is a credible plot and set pieces that dont read like set pieces  yes, well accept less, but we thrill to stories and characters that feel new. Well, Night Life is 332 pages of new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I2HU0CKHEI5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765374838#wasThisHelpful","R2I2HU0CKHEI5B","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best book Ive read this year begins like this: Whenever I wake up next to a man, before Im fully awake, I think its Ted. Of course it never is.Lillian, the narrator of Lillian on Life, goes on to identify some of the major elements of her romantic life: a man, red wine, K-Y Jelly (because shes now of an age when lubrication is necessary before sex), and waking up early and using the bathroom to get that all out of the way before they get up.Sex is not the subject of Alison Jean Lesters terrific first novel; its a matter-of-fact presence in a life rich in romantic experience and practical knowledge. And that, for me, was the first surprise of this book. For all its literary ambitions, its not bloated with the kind of pretense that makes me run for the exits. In this novel-that-reads-like-a-memoir, Lillian is credible, likeable, even lovable. In a word: real.If I had to summarize, Id say that these 238 pages tell the story of a woman whos 60+, alone, with a healthy interest in sex and not much interest in figuring out what went wrong. Thats the novels second surprise: Lillian has no agenda, her book is not a screed. Born in the late 1930s, she grew up when a womans story was, to a great extent, the story of the man she married. But no one married Lillian; her story is not, in the conventional way, his story.Looking for an overarching thesis about the lot of women? Look elsewhere. For Lillian, the story of her life doesnt lead to any grand conclusion: So many people say that everything happens for a reason. Ive always felt that things happen because the things before them happen, thats all.Lets stop here and consider our lives. Do you see a cosmic plan unfolding for you? Do you assess your life through the prism of your hard work and focus and will? How much of who you are is just dumb luck? Bottom line: How you explain that you are reading this in a room with heat and a computer that springs to life as soon as your fingers touch the keyboard and a dinner table set for two or more?This comparison of your life to Lillians is an essential part of your reading of her book, especially if youre a woman and you have a decent sex drive and the question of a man has not been permanently answered for you. But you probably wont make that comparison right away, because, in the beginning, Lillian fills your head and heart, and you want so much for her to have a great life.Lillians story, in brief: In 1956, while she was at Vassar, she was offered a job as a typist in Munich. For 6 weeks. She arrived with one suit. Met a man. One thing led to another and she became secretary in the Paris bureau of a newspaper, and met Willis, and moved to London and then New York, and met Ted.The culture shock of Europe knocked the ability to judge other peoples behavior right out of me. Nobody came from where I came from or felt what I felt, so I adapted. Gay men loved how unconventionally I lived, I think. But I wanted to get married and have children. That had been the plan. Lovers and wine, cigarettes and skinny black clothes  those were the detritus on the rings circling the planet of my dreams. I was in orbit and I couldnt find my way across the void.How was she launched in orbit? Of course it started at home: a handsome, attentive father and a mother who didnt appreciate him enough, so he lavished affection on his daughter. Lillian doesnt lean on that explanation. She moves on to other men. Dave, who looks like a fashion model. Laszlo, the cosmopolitan Hungarian. Willis, a photographer from Texas, who picked her up at a caf in Paris. And then, in 1968, her great love, Ted. Some single, some married, all more of less in charge. And thus:When youre in a relationship you mold yourself to it. You curve your body around it and you curve your mind around it in order to maintain it. Sometimes you dont realize youre crippled until its too late.For the first hour, I read this book with a pen in hand, marking wildly, checking the jokes (there are many) and the stunning confrontations (ditto). Then I just surrendered. And marveled. I spoil nothing by quoting the last paragraph:Ive always wondered why people look so much to action for meaning. When people tell you a story  something that happened to them, something important  dont ask them what they did. Ask them what they wanted to do. What they want to do is who they are. Actions are whispers compared to dreams.That last sentence  Actions are whispers compared to dreams  is, for me, as good as it gets. I dont know who I love more, Lillian or Alison Jean Lester. If you pick up this book, you will soon have the same problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUJ9CHFSZ8QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168893#wasThisHelpful","RIUJ9CHFSZ8QF","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very few people find early in life what they want to do and get to do it all their lives. At the top of the list in music: Mark Knopfler.Knopfler got his first guitar at 15, practiced with the same ferocity as guitar god Chet Atkins (You should fall asleep with the guitar in your hands), and found a style of playing that has become among the most famous signatures in music. Sultans of Swing, the first Dire Straits single, made Top Five lists; in 8 years, the band went on to sell 125 million records. And then Knopfler called it quits.Disbanding at the top? Who does that? The Beatles. Who else? Mark Knopfler had what may look like smaller dreams: writing great songs, making great records, working to make each one better. The happy result: As a self-improvement effort, Knopflers solo career cant be topped. Nor can Tracker. Recorded in old-fashioned analog, enjoyed through state-of-the-moment earphones, it elevates easy-on-the-ears listening to a complex, subtle mosaic  to art.Example: For Tracker, he wrote and recorded a song about British novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1934-2010). She published 18 novels and two collections of short stories, and if you can name just one title, I tip my hat to you. Often nominated for the prestigious Booker Prize, she never won  and as the Booker is awarded to living writers, the only way the prize committee could correct its error was to create a one-off for her the year after she died.Knopfler is a Bainbridge fan  thats not surprising; like him, she ruthlessly edited her writing to the essential  and, outraged on her behalf, he wrote harsh, caustic lyrics:Beryl was on another levelWhen she got a Booker medalShe was dead in her graveAfter all she gaveAfter all she gaveBut Knopfler is nothing if not strategic. A rant about a virtual unknown? Not for him. So he set the words against music straight from the Sultans of Swing playbook. Suddenly it sounds like a hit, doesnt it?I have a simple test for beauty: It makes me cry. Mark Knopflers music does that. Infallibly. Overlook, for a moment, the too-smart-for-pop lyrics and the confidential voice. The way Knopfler plays guitar is the way I try to write: every note impeccable, inevitable. To listen to Tracker is to hear 84 minutes of music that is, for fans of grown-up music, just a bit better than almost anything else out there. To listen to Tracker is to weep for joy.But for all his artistry, Knopfler is stunningly modest, even self-deprecating. Ive enjoyed his wit, intelligence and modesty every few years, when I interview him...Jesse Kornbluth: Jack Nicholson says: Until youre 27, you can live on barbed wire. After that, you pay for everything. In the fall, youre playing 35 American cities in 6 weeks. And youre no longer 27. Whats your regime?Mark Knopfler: You pay a price getting older. As Bette Davis said, old age isnt for sissies. I do two gyms and one Pilates a week, and I havent had a cigarette in close to 15 years. You have to look after yourself, so Ive built more days off into the tour. And  Im a slow learner  Ive discovered I like to write on the road.JK: In 2013, to protest Putin, you canceled shows in Moscow and St Petersburg. Where wont you be playing on this tour?MK: I canceled the Russian shows because, from the days of the first Dire Straits album, Ive supported Amnesty International. Its not a good thing to read about people being jailed for no reason, so I raised my hand and made a small objection. It was good to do  but where do you stop?JK: The last time I interviewed you, I called a Dire Straits reunion tour the easiest $300 million youll ever make. That didnt move you. Have you reconsidered?MK: No. A long time ago, I thought we could get together to do something for charity. But I saw where that would lead: more shows, a record, a tour. It would mean going back to big.JK: Your songs are indelible  you correctly call them landmarks. I get the high of touring: hanging out with your mates, seeing the world. But when youre playing the classics, whats the thrill?MK: A song like Brothers in Arms  it captures a moment. And because its become meaningful to many people, I have an obligation to play it well.JK: Interviewing John Updike, I mentioned our good fortune: We never had to take a job. Yes, he said, we got away with it. And so, it seems, have you. That is: youve done it your way.MK: I had a lot of jobs before I got into music. When I was 15, I was a copy boy for the Evening Chronicle in Newcastle. Then I was a journalist. I value those experiences  I got to see how the world works. But yes, in music, youre right.JK: The wisdom of age  got any?MK: Ive learned to respect what talent Ive got. Im sure I didnt for many years  I was just playing and running with it. Now I stick to my little ditties. Doing a film score is outside my zone. I feel like an imposter from time to time.JK: My favorite Zen master used to tell his students: I think youre perfect. And I think you can improve. Is there anything youre working to get better at?MK: Gillian Welch told me, All Im trying to do is write a good song and make a good record. That sums it up. And you hope, as you go along, you get better.JK: True or false: Any idiot can write a 6-minute art song. It takes a genius to write a 2:45 song with three chords and a hook.MK: It depends on the chords. But a proper songwriter can do it in a few words.JK: You and J.J. Cale came from such different backgrounds its stunning to me that you have a similar musical philosophy. How does that happen?MK: The first time I heard James Burton play lead guitar on A Little Too Much, all I knew was that Ricky Nelson was a terrific singer and that guitar player was also terrific. Id bet when J.J. heard that song he thought pretty much the same thing.JK: You have a degree in literature. Your first jobs were in journalism. Shouldnt you write a book?MK: I dont think my prose would hold up. It might even bore you to death  really, it might read like a note to the milkman. Better for me to stick to songs.JK: By writing a song about her, and with really catchy music, youve done the estate of Beryl Bainbridge a great favor. What other writers would you like to champion?MK: Many. Beryl grabbed my attention for her writing, but even more for the fact that she never won the Booker Prize until she was dead. In her time, the judges were from Cambridge or Oxford, mostly male, definitely inclined to snobbery. Beryl was from Liverpool, poor, not educated. Her publisher didnt promote her books  and he was having an affair with her. So when I wrote the song, I went to a Sultans of Swing style to evoke her time.JK: You have children, some quite young. What do they think about your music?MK: Issy, my 17-year-old, plays guitar in her room. When I told her about the musicians I was recording with, shed never heard of any of them. Thats how it is when youre young  youre in your own world. When I mentioned someone to my son the drummer, he asked if that was in the olden days.JK: So, from the vantage point of the olden days, as best you can see it, whats your future?MK: Hopping from one slippery stone to the next, until it ends in tears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZCEZIQ88W6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1M7KXO#wasThisHelpful","R6ZCEZIQ88W6C","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When George Hodgman was a boy, he and his mother ended the day holding hands and praying. Not just for themselves, but for all the people in their tiny Missouri town. We made our way from one street to the next, we asked for help for those suffering in this place or that, for people who were poor or who had lost someone, or those who had found themselves in trouble.George asked his mother if these prayers worked.It is something we can do for one another, Betty Hodgman said. We have to understand we are all together here. We have to try and help people.Betty had some eye surgery. She feared she was going blind. George wanted to pray for her, but he was embarrassed to do it in her presence. So he asked if, that night, he could say his prayers on his own.Her face changed, he writes. She dropped my glasses on the table and looked down at her lap before pulling away. I wanted to take it back, but it was too late, she was gone. She left so fast. She didnt bring it up, but the next night she did not come to my room. Never again would we have our special time. She would not risk being sent away again. I grew up to be just like her. Like my mother, I flee at the slightest suggestion I am unwanted.This anecdote says so much, and a lesser writer might have started the book with it. George Hodgman buries it on page 164. Why hold it back? Because, at the surface level, Bettyville is a simple story: a charming but difficult man comes home to care for his charming but difficult mother. Betty, in her 90s, is winding down, suffering from dementia or maybe worse. George was once a valued editor at Vanity Fair  where, in my day, the office politics were so Mandarin that putting out the magazine was almost an afterthought  and at a publisher. He got downsized; now hes a freelance book editor in Manhattan. But his fathers dead, and hes an only child. Off he goes to Paris, Missouri (population: 1,220).Thats one story, and its often an amusing one. First, because Betty is a crisp tennis partner for banter, Georges best game. Youre a mean old woman. Youre not a bit good, he tells her. And she shoots right back: I cant believe youre not in the penitentiary. And then theres the odd couple angle: A month ago I thought the Medicare doughnut hole was a breakfast special for seniors. I am a care inflictor.A close second to George-and-Betty is the story of George, the proverbial hot mess. Hes gay, but perennially unattached: My life has been an odd hotel with strangers drifting through. Complicated? I am a loner, but I hate to lose people. His virtues  hes a hard worker, he must always get it right  may not really be virtues: I have spent my life trailed by voices in my head saying, This isnt right. Youre not right. And not because hes gay. Its that his sexuality has baffled and disappointed his parents so completely that they could never talk about it.Inevitably, George becomes a performer, an artist skilled at distraction, control: Look at me, but dont see. Watch, but not too closely. And hes very good at it. His problem isnt gay marriage, its gay dating. At rehab, hes asked if he has trouble with intimacy. Only when I try to get close to someone. In his lexicon, hes not emotionally unavailable, just temporarily out of stock. The only cuisine hes ever mastered: seasonal drugs. He wont ask Betty about her funeral preferences because hes fearful that she will demand a salad bar. I leave it to you to insert the drum rolls.These threads are expertly woven together, and it warmed my heart when the Times Style section sent a writer to Missouri to chronicle George Hodgmans ongoing adventure with his mother. In my corner of Facebook, George is beloved. The bestseller list awaits.For all that, there were lines in Bettyville that made this memoir impossible for me to read it, as others have, in one gulp. My father could never have anything he wanted. He lived for us  I know that story, and its not a happy one. The world of the Dollar Store, the Big Cup, the carbohydrate, and the cinnamon roll  I periodically make what I call Field Trips to America, and the wreckage of the land and the sadness of suburbia never fail to make me want to cry. Bettys childhood poverty is touching: her mother sold milk to put her through college, her family was the last in town to get indoor plumbing. Most of all, theres the presence of death on every page. As Le Rochefoucauld reminds us: No man can look long at the sun or death.So, sometimes, I skimmed. And, though rarely, I skipped. And, once, for a day, I put the book down. Why return? Why volunteer for pain? Sometime, at least once, everyone should see someone through. All the way home. That is beyond admirable. To read to the end is to cheer for the proposition. And, of course, to cheer for George Hodgman.I wanted a place in the tribe, he says. I still do.Hes got one now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH5XY0A6A4H9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427201#wasThisHelpful","RH5XY0A6A4H9M","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American media loves horse races, which is a good reason to avoid watching political pundits on cable TV. Book reviewers have resisted this reductionist way of considering writers, but in recent years Ive seen Alan Furst and Joseph Kanon often mentioned in the same sentence. Furst is generally regarded as Americas master of the historical spy novel, but Kanon has, with each book, steadily gained ground.Leaving Berlin is a big book that will put Kanon even with Furst, or maybe ahead. (For me, big means 371 pages.) Its got a terrific plot hook  Alex Meier, a German-Jewish writer who fled the Nazis, gets into political trouble in the United States, and, in 1949, at the height of the Berlin Airlift, returns to live in his native city. If he can give useful information to American spymasters, he can return to Los Angeles and his young son; as hes not a writer of spy thrillers, hes a bit over his head.Kanon has written about postwar Berlin before  'The Good German' is set there. (It became a movie, starring George Clooney and Cate Blanchett.) The grey chill of the cover photo is also in Kanons prose; on every page, you feel the shabbiness of the housing, the shortage of food and electricity, and, mostly, the oppressive presence of the Russians. Its a bitter irony; the Nazi thugs have been replaced by Russian goons. Idealism? The new Socialist paradise? By 1949, even the most dedicated Socialists know better: Nobody ever said it would be easy A just society must be worth a few sacrifices, no?Alex Meier arrives with a realists view of the East German authorities. (In Washington, hed been grilled by Joe McCarthys interrogators. Hed seen the faces before, the jowls and smirks, when theyd been Nazis.) He is less armored against friends from his much happier early years, and its no surprise that he takes up with a woman who was his first lover. But in a Kanon novel, identity is a mask. People are rarely who they seem to be. His lover, especially, but really, everyone. (Even Bertolt Brecht, a prickly genius of astonishing selfishness, isnt quite as offensive  he rarely bathed and stank like a badger  as historical accounts describe him.)Because almost everyone has at least two faces, the book is an onion that slowly gets peeled. For veteran readers of thrillers, this will be pure pleasure. For me, its a challenge  my novel has three major characters, and they struggle with their single identities. But with each Kanon novel, Im getting smarter. Soon I may, like some of you, be able to read his elegant, complex novels without gasping every few pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLAH8GSMFP55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476704643#wasThisHelpful","RFLAH8GSMFP55","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seth Greenland also wrote ""Shining City,"" a novel about a failing Los Angeles businessman who inherits his brothers prostitution ring. Its funny and smart, and my review begins with this: I have, at long last, read a contemporary novel I wish Id written.I can say the same about his new book, I Regret Everything. Its just my kind of novel, a brisk 250 pages and streamlined  as Greenland says, a compact story about two characters who fall in love.For those who thought the TV series The Affair was all that, I Regret Everything has a similar format: alternating first person accounts. But not the stupid he said/she said of that TV series. This is much deeper: two characters of great depth and complexity, characters who become real to the reader.Real and funny and, because real and funny is always the precursor in a love story to bad s***, powerful and heartbreaking and, we hope hope hope, triumphant at the end. Im not going to say much about the story, because one of the pleasures of good fiction is that you dont see whats coming next even if the writer has sprinkled breadcrumbs along the way. And Greenland, who was a writer-producer on the exceedingly well-plotted HBO series, Big Love, knows how to set up surprises with the best of them.So let just introduce the characters and their situation.Jeremy Best is a 33-year-old lawyer. He works in a Manhattan firm, where his specialty could not be more boring: trusts and estates. Whats interesting about him? Under the name Jinx Bell, hes a published poet, on his way to finishing a book. Thats a secret  his colleagues and employers have no idea. (Imagine having thousands of gold coins hidden in a safe. I was rich and the world none the wiser.) Brave on the page, a coward in life, risk averse and careful in the extreme. In relationships, hes a master of the unreturned phone call, the forgotten birthday, the middle-distance stare.Spaulding Samuelson is 19. Her father is the managing partner of the firm that employs Jeremy. Shes attractive, if by attractive you mean a relatively pretty girl whose false smile could pass for real in low light. That self-description should alert you: she is whip smart, great with a glib line and troubled. How troubled? She recently did a month in a mental hospital.Spaulding wanders into Jeremys office. They banter. She surprises him with a fact  shes read his poem in the Paris Review. And then the would-be writer leaves. Lust at first sight? Please, this is fiction, not Fifty Shades.Lonely. Damaged. Needy. Scared. I recognize those as motivations, because they drove my life for decades. If they are familiar to you as well, you may be uncommonly interested in these characters, even though their lives couldnt be more different from yours. And although improbable events occur along the way, youll buy them, because what is a love story if not improbable?I spoil the experience of reading I Regret Everything if I say much more, but I want to share  or over-share  how the book affected me. I read it in one gulp on a plane to California. The next day my mother and I were having lunch in the garden of an undistinguished bar/restaurant in Encinitas. Our waitress was young, in her 20s. We spoke briefly, but there was something about her.As we were leaving, she was at the waitress station, tapping orders into a computer. I went over to her, on auto-pilot. Were never going to see one another again in this life, I said, but I feel I should tell you that I think you have great qualities and you are, in the best sense of the word, adorable, and you should hold that thought. And she got it. It was a perfect moment.I talk to strangers. Not like this, never like this. But I was under the spell of the book and the fierce message at its core  Never give in  and its acute sense of the velocity of time. Days later, Im still touched, inspired and wounded by I Regret Everything. Consider yourselves warned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAL9J8BC3RZIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160945247X#wasThisHelpful","RAL9J8BC3RZIF","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I emerged from a 30-hour binge of three seasons of Borgen --- 1,800 minutes in Danish, with subtitles --- exalted and limp, weepy and thrilled. Writing, acting, directing: this series about Danish coalition politics is simply the best television weve seen in years.  After, as we talked about it, we hit upon a reason why: no graphic sex. This may seem strange --- theyre very free and open about sex in Scandinavia, arent they? Yes, they are, which may be why showing people kissing and then having the proverbial cigarette in bed after sex is quite sufficient for Scandinavian TV. In contrast, American shows like The Affair feature lovers throwing one another against walls and ripping into each others flesh like weasels. Watch an hour or three of Borgen, and, in addition to the high level of intelligence of its drama, youll have fresh contempt for the silly porn on Americas adult dramas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY4VEXGOV0F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BELOF14#wasThisHelpful","R3HY4VEXGOV0F2","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back when Mel Gibson was Mel Gibson, he made some movies on the block where Sonia Taitz lives.Sonia Taitz is married. A mother. Not looking to stray.But. Mel Gibson?Imagine the sizzle of seeing Mel stroll by the MealMart on West 79th Street, slipping into this trailer! she recalls.Then Mel stopped being Mel and starting spouting anti-Semitic clichs.Sonia Taitzs grandfather was killed by Cossacks. Her father spent World War II in Dachau. She learned languages in this order: Yiddish, then English, then Hebrew.Mel Gibson faded as a fantasy. And ascended as a character:What makes people hate like that? And how could my local hero feel that way? In researching Mels childhood and adolescence, both of which took place in New York State, I began to create a plausible story of how he was wounded, and warped, as a child. I added a Romeo and Juliet/ Jew and non-Jew slant to the fictionalization: The boy based on Mel falls in puppy love with a Jewish girl who spurns him. He wants to run away with her, but the plan fails, and he is whisked, instead, to Australia. This romantic disappointment, coupled with his fathers views on Jews, lights a dangerous long fuse. Decades later, a star in decline, he journeys back to find the girl who jilted him.First love, second chances  thats the engine for a novel. (And love between apparent opposites is, for Taitz, a logical step. In her excellent novel, ""In the Kings Arms,"" her heroine is a young New York Jew at  Oxford.)Down Under starts with this: In the middle of the journey of her life, Jude Ewington realizes that she is starting to see real lapses in the looks department. How cool. An echo of Dante (Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, for the straightforward pathway had been lost) followed by contemporary slang (the looks department). I took out my pen and started marking.Heres the first chapter. Brisk. Smart. Really well observed. With a least three perceptions you might want to mark and think about.What are the odds Jude will leave her marriage and zoom off to Tahiti with a man she hasnt seen in decades? Not good. Collum Whitsum  thats Mel  isnt aging like Jude in a suburban, American way. This is not the middle of the journey for him. Hes an actor, a star. Hes old. So his suffering  his constant boring pain  puts him on a heros sort of quest.We flash back and forth from Jude to Collum. Her marriage, his marriage. Her childhood, his childhood. The comparisons are stark. Her childhood is modestly Jewish compared to his Catholic upbringing  his father is so crazy that if he were Muslim, hed pledge himself to jihad. So theres real tension as a badly damaged Mel  I mean Collum  leaves Australia and makes his way to Westchester.Im not a fan of fancy plotting. Taitz isnt either, but the book is much more than Collum and Jude. Jude has a troubled son and her sort-of-friend has a troubled daughter, and these kids  new generation versions of the young lovers that Jude and Collum once were  are crucial to the plot. Theres good stuff in those chapters, but I was eager for the Jude-Collum fireworks to begin. And Taitz kept me waiting. Which proves two things. 1) Shes good. 2) Im impatient.Better than the story, in any case, are the perceptions. Sonia Taitz knows a lot about people: how they are, what they want, the broken-hearted child that often lies beyond the rise and fall of complex people who self-destruct. Of recent books Ive read, in fact, no one knows more about what she calls emotional kamikazes. Who are, in our fantasies, many more than Mel Gibson and his long lost high school sweetheart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DR3UR9WJY4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985222743#wasThisHelpful","R29DR3UR9WJY4E","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It wont do to describe Charlie Scheips, as his site does, as a curator, art adviser, writer and cultural historian. Hes all that, but in Manhattan, this description is close to generic. What distinguishes Charlie Scheips from the art mob is his range. He knows everyone  instead of a photograph, his book jacket image is his portrait, painted by David Hockney  and instead of serving up a smart spin on the latest trend, he scores actual scoops.Like, for instance, a treasure trove of close to 200 unpublished photographs of Elsie de Wolfes 1939 Circus Ball. Hes used these as the centerpiece of a book like no other. On the surface, its a voyeurs dream, a behind-the-scenes look at the high water mark of a kind of entertaining that went extinct two months later, when Hitler invaded Poland. But more, its a deep dive, an X-ray of an elite Society that took dinner parties and balls as seriously as we take our work  because it was their work.As Scheips writes: This book is my search to bring back a lost moment in time, when men in white tie and women in elaborate evening dresses saw the occasion of a grand ball as an expression of sophistication and a means to confirm the existence of a civilized life  and have fun.Ephemeral? Beyond. As a biographer of Proust has noted, Even the greatest hostess is forgotten when the last of her guests dies. But to Elsie and her crowd, an invitation to a great party was the equivalent of immortality. Now, in a book, they actually have it.When she hosted the last Circus Ball, Elsie was 81. Shed done it all: Shed been an actress, Americas first interior decorator, longtime companion of the very rich Bessie Marbury, and bestselling author.In 1903, touring the Palace of Versailles, de Wolfe and Marbury found an abandoned Louis XV pavilion. They bought the Villa Trianon and, with Marburys fortune, restored it. In 1926, de Wolfe married Sir Charles Mendl; as Lady Mendl, she did less decorating and more entertaining. She became a pillar of Society, famous for being famous and ripe for inclusion in a Cole Porter song, because everybody knew she did headstands as part of her morning exercises:When you hear that Lady Mendl standing upNow turns a handspring landing upOn her toes,Anything goes.The Circus Ball of 1939  the second of an annual event given on the final evening of the social season  featured bejeweled white Lipizzaner horses and even more bejeweled guests. The beauty part: Scheips also takes us backstage, to the preparation of a circus ring, the feeding of the ponies, the icing of the champagne, the three weeks of preparation, the planeloads of roses.And then the war came, and the Mendls fled to America.Imagine the Titanic, iceberg approaching, as the glittering passengers danced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB7KR9JU5BTQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419713892#wasThisHelpful","RB7KR9JU5BTQD","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to pay me $15 million a year, I promise never to say a bad word about you. I will work until I drop. I will be a saint to my staff. And if our project fails, I will take all the blame.Thats not how it works in television news, which is why theres enough backbiting, envy and ambition in The News Sorority: Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour  and the (Ongoing, Imperfect, Complicated) Triumph of Women in TV News to fill almost 500 pages.On one level, The News Sorority is a serious book, a valuable history of a transitional era in media that will be read and taught long after no one can remember why anchor doesnt just apply to boats.For now, though, it wont be read that way, for The News Sorority is a dish fest  if you care what Katie and Diane and Christiane are really like, for Gods sake do not start reading on a Friday night, because youll miss Bill Maher and may just be finishing when John Oliver comes on.How dishy? Like this:When Diane scored an interview that Katie wanted, Katie asked, loudly: I wonder who she blew this time.Diane, on wardrobe choices for women in broadcasting: Always wear clothes in fabrics that men like to touch.Katie once told an executive shed been fired  she hadnt been  so could get a promotion to a job she wanted.Dianes such a slick politician that she thinks she doesnt leave fingerprints  but she leaves cat paw prints on peoples foreheads.Katie gave a Christmas party for her entourage that could be seen by lesser staffers at the lesser party.Diane once had her then boyfriend Richard Holbrooke call a production assistant and reduce her to tears.And Christiane? Wheres that dish? Scarce. Very scarce. She never said she went to Brown  although she was a housemate of John Kennedy Jr., she graduated from the University of Rhode Island  but if that was your misimpression, she wasnt always quick to correct it. In the early days of CNN, she sometimes cleaned the foreign desk with Fantastik. And, much later, she wasnt above saying, Do you know Im the worlds best known foreign correspondent?Theres not much dish on Amanpour because shes the real deal, an old-fashioned correspondent who runs toward trouble and doesnt neuter her reporting with the bulls*** false equivalency of too many of her colleagues. Her reporting in Bosnia is probably the single biggest reason Bill Clinton and Tony Blair intervened in that humanitarian crisis. And her dispatches from the Middle East could be tough on Israel.Because most readers will probably skip or skim the chapters about Amanpour, this book is, for practical purposes, about Katie and Diane and their footrace to be the first female anchor of the evening news. That gives the book the feel of instant nostalgia. As Weller writes, The venerable six-thirty news broadcast has been a classy feature of American conversation almost since the beginning of television, but it was also a relic of another era: before 24-hour cable and the Internet, which gave the news in real time; before the complicated, constantly in flux schedules of modern life. Translation: The 6:30 PM network news is as dead as disco. And that makes Katie and Dianes careers seem like a fools errand, a waste of time and talent. Yes, they broke the glass ceiling, but no women will stand on their shoulders. They were the first  and the last.I loved Wellers last book, ""Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon  and the Journey of a Generation"" for its authoritative reporting and deep understanding. Like that book, The News Sorority is exhaustively reported. And unauthorized, which is a good thing  can you imagine if Katie and Diane and their handlers had final approval of the manuscript? This would have been the story of the Bobbsey Twins and their bookish friend Christy. And I wouldnt have lost a weekend and you wouldnt have read this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZXQ5JFZ7299B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204276#wasThisHelpful","R1ZXQ5JFZ7299B","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leonard Cohen is 80.Popular Problems is his 15th collection of original songs.Its tempting, given those facts, to think that hes slowing down.That would be wrong  Cohen has never been fast.The refusal to speed  the pathological unwillingness to write a song that rips you out of your chair  is the through-line of Cohens career. He says so himself, in Slow, the first song on the new CD:""Ill get there when I doDont need no starting gunIts not because Im oldAnd its not what dying doesI always liked it slowSlow is in my blood.""Slow, as in sex. Slow, as in speech. Slow, as in graceful movement and calculated expression. Slow, as in philosophy: nowhere to go, no hurry to get there.When youre chasing buzz, someone said of Tina Brown, youre always behind. Cohen, timeless, was generally ahead of his time. And now time has caught up to him  hes right on time. On our time, which begs us to jump off the hamster wheel, think, look and breathe. Our time, which begs us to recover our selves. Time, the ultimate popular problem.From the beginning, Cohen focused on creativity rather than career. He knew what he had to work with, and he played to his strengths. Or, rather, as I explained in a New York Times piece a few years ago about ""Old Ideas"", he played to his weaknesses: ""His range as a composer is limited; as he has noted, 'People said I knew three chords when I knew five' His vocal range is even more limited. A fan got it exactly right when he said, 'No one can sing a Leonard Cohen song the way Cohen himself cant.' The dirge-like songs and midnight voice that result are an easy target for reviewers. Hes 'the poet laureate of pessimism.' 'The grocer of despair.' 'The godfather of gloom.' 'The prince of bummers.' And, inevitably, 'music to slit your wrists to.'But because his limitations are violations of the basic beliefs of the music business, they ironically became his strengths.In a HeadButler.com appreciation of Cohen, I shared a revealing story:Roshi [his Zen master] came to the studio one night when I was recording New Skin for the Old Ceremony. That was in the seventies. In those days I was being written off as a morbid old depressive drone peddling suicide notes. (Still am, in some circles). Roshi slept through most, but not all, of the session. The next morning I asked him what he thought. He said, Leonard, you should sing more sad. That was the best advice I ever got. Took a while to put it into practice.Slow and sad and increasingly spare. How does Popular Problems differ from other Cohen CDs? Its more stripped down, more electronic  like the skeletal Cohen, it doesnt have an ounce of fat. Which pushes the words and the delivery forward. And, of course, the subject of these songs, which is love, which Cohen describes as that very dangerous area where the possibilities for humiliation and failure are ample.At 80, Cohen announced, hed start smoking again. On this CD, he already did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYD591SABNF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJJ37BE#wasThisHelpful","R1BYD591SABNF4","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because its completely correct that 12-year-olds should loathe Blake Mills  hes from a breed unknown to young music fans: a pure artist.Oh, Im sure he knows the power of a dollar  he produced the next Alabama Shakes CD, which should pay a lot of bills  but the beauty of Blake Mills is that his primary concern is making music thats absolutely authentic to the moment of creation.

Eric Clapton called him the last guitarist I heard that I thought was phenomenal. Fiona Apple showcased him on tour. And now we have a CD released on a real label, with his picture on the cover, even if its mostly obscured by giant type. Well, he can push/pull all he wants. He cant hide the bottom line: This is magnificent, challenging, adult music, this is what music aspires to, this is Art.Mills has a deeply idiosyncratic attitude about words, and the title of the CD is a tell. HEIGH HO first suggests a song from a 1937 Disney movie about Snow White: Heigh ho, heigh ho, its off to work we go The dictionary definition is all over the map: used typically to express boredom, weariness, or sadness or sometimes as a cry of encouragement. Meaning, exactly, what?So when it comes to lyrics, hes not entirely trustworthy on the question of sincerity. In Dont Tell Your Friends About Me we find my apologizing --- one phrase, repeated seven times. As sung, that brutally honest repetition is powerful and then some. But in the same song, I find irony:""You said you just needed some time to adjustThen heres 48 hours, 3 weeks, and 2 months..""My takeaway: We shouldnt over-think his lyrics. Better to just listen, and listen closely.The singer/songwriter thing is a lifelong study of ones self and the human experience, Mills has said. All were doing is trying to invent words for things that people have felt or might feel at some point. Thats the job.Wouldnt it be fantastic if more musicians felt that way?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDN0A9C9NBL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0ETRGC#wasThisHelpful","RXDN0A9C9NBL8","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daphne Merkin is frighteningly intelligent. You only have to read a few paragraphs of her writing to know that shes read, heard and seen everything written, recorded and filmed, and that, for good measure, she has a point of view about her subject that is dramatically different from every other writer. But Daphne Merkin is not only deeply smart, she is deeply troubled. Shes the queen of Too Much Information, though in her case the oversharing is the point.She was, she tells us, born into a family of casually Orthodox Jews. They Merkins were rich  they lived in a Park Avenue duplex, they had a house staff  but money somehow didnt seem plentiful. Her father was successful and distant. She could never get close to her mother; young Daphne had a sense of not having been loved  or, to put it more precisely, responded to in a way that felt like love. At 5, she began to be apprehensive about what lay in wait for me. At 8, she was wholly unwilling to attend school, out of some combination of fear and separation anxiety.But she could write. Lord, could she write. When she was 21, she reviewed a book by Jane Bowles. Woody Allen wrote her a fan letter: Youre wasting your gifts on reviewing. They became friends. Many years later, over lunch, she told him she felt more depressed than usual. With that, as she writes in this collection of pieces, the interrogation began:""How depressed? he immediately wanted to know. Quite depressed, I said. Did I have trouble getting up in the morning? Lots, I answered. Did I ever stay in bed all day? No, I said, but it was often noon before I got out of my nightgown. But of course I continued to write, he said. I answered that I hadnt written a word in weeks. He looked quite serious and then gently asked me if I had ever thought about trying shock therapy. Shock therapy? Yes, he said, he knew a friend  a famous friend  for whom it had been quite helpful. Maybe I should try it.Sure, I said. Thanks. I dont know what I had been hoping for  some version of come with me and I will cuddle you until your sadness goes away, not go get yourself hooked up to electrodes, baby  but I was slightly stunned. More than slightly. I understood that he was trying to be helpful in his way, but it fell so far short. We shook hands on Madison Avenue and then gave each other a polite peck, as we always did. It was sunny and cool as I made my way home, looking in at the windows full of bright summer dresses. Shock therapy? It wasnt as though I hadnt heard of it or didnt know people who had benefited from it. Still, how on earth did he conceive of me? As a chronic mental patient, someone who was meant to sit on a thin hospital mattress and stare grayly into space? Didnt he know I was a writer with a future, a person given to creative descriptions of her own moods? Shock therapy, indeed; Id sooner try a spa.It suddenly occurred to me, as I walked up Madison Avenue, that it might pay to be resilient, if this was all being vulnerable and skinless got you. People didnt stop and cluck over the damage done unless you made it worth their while. Indeed, maybe it was time to rethink this whole salvation business. Or maybe I was less desperate, less teetering on the edge, than I cared to admit. Now, that was a refreshing possibility.""Now that Ive suggested the psychological terrain  and these are just the top notes, expressed as vulgar journalism  what about The Fame Lunches: On Wounded Icons, Money, Sex, the Bronts, and the Importance of Handbags, Daphne Merkins new collection of essays? There are 45 of them, and the topics are, as they say, wide-ranging.Merkin is extremely conscious of surface appearance, especially her weight, so theres an essay called In My Head Im Always Thin. Our Money, Ourselves tracks her familys public philanthropy and private tightness: At some point I took to muttering darkly to my mother that charity began at home, but she would always fix me with a contemptuous look and ask, And what exactly is it that you lack? She managed to make me feel ungrateful and grabby at once.There are meditations on stars, most of them damaged icons ripe for her healing analysis  Marilyn, Michael, Truman, Courtney. Her take on Princess Dianas marriage will suggest the tone: I find myself wondering how Dianas life might have turned out if she and Charles had bonded over their shared lack of childhood, their virtual abandonment as children. What would have happened if they had the patience (on his side) and endurance (on hers) to address their mutual longings for love and nurturance in each other?There are book reviews, many of them learned, some of them esoteric. Zingers appear  on John Updike: He began to seem like a man who always wore a hat to work.  but the general reader may feel lost. No problem. This isnt a book you read cover-to-cover in an evening. Its a book you dip into, reading what you like, skipping what doesnt appeal.Tina Brown told Daphne Merkin, The art of self-exposure is not simply catharsis. True, especially for Daphne Merkin. I know her just well enough to believe she found only modest catharsis in writing these pieces. Shes after something bigger, smarter, grander. And in her endless distress, she often finds it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5JBR2BY3Z2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374140375#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5JBR2BY3Z2D","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last time I wrote about Louise Fili on HeadButler.com, my readers bought so many of her Perfetto Pencils that Amazon sold out and her publisher called me to ask how that happened.Now shes produced a box of a dozen note cards and envelopes that are just as distinctive. Quattro Parole Italiane is the idea. Four Italian words: ciao (hello), auguri (greetings), grazie (thank you) and prego (with pleasure).Why are these cards so striking? Its not the words, which are refreshingly ordinary, but the typography, which is dramatic and different and, at the same time, nostalgic and familiar, taking you back to visits to small towns in Italy or, more likely, period movies like The Conformist.Why cards? Fili explains:""Once, when I was in Milan researching a book on Italian art deco, I found myself one stifling afternoon in a magazzino  a warehouse  filled with printers proofs of labels and other ephemera from the 1920s. And I found a series of pasticceria papers, all created by hand. They were the most unusual and beautiful graphic work Id seen in a long time. I brought them back to New York, where they ended up having a great influence on my design voice. Quattro Parole Italiane is a love letter to the anonymous designers who provided me with such unforgettable inspiration.""An Italy lost, an Italy of the imagination  this is Fili territory. In a digital age, her work couldnt be more analog. And more specific: Her inspiration is an era in Italian design that begins roughly in 1920 and ends with the neonization of signage in Italy around 1960. You get the idea: Louise Fili may live and work in New York, but her head and heart resides in Italy.But let her explain.""When I was 16, I took my first trip to Italy with my parents, who were both born there; it was their first trip back. I remember taking a flight into Milan, and as we were leaving the airport, the first thing I saw was an ad for Baci Perugina that was the only type on it. I was immediately fascinated by the billboard, which showed a couple in a passionate embrace. I knew that Baci meant kisses, but I didnt know that it was advertising at all. It didnt matter; I was smitten. It was a three-way epiphany for me, because thats when I fell in love with type, food, and Italy all at once.""She started her career as a book designer, and quickly advanced to the top of that field; from 1978 to 1989, she was art director of Pantheon Books, where she designed 2,000 book jackets. When she opened her own studio, she made a sharp turn into restaurant logos and food packaging. Youve seen her work: Tiffany, Paperless Post, Williams-Sonoma, Sarabeths, Tates Cookies and many more.The first office for her design firm was in her home. Now she walks to work, but her office fools visitors  it could almost be an apartment. For Fili, all work spaces are launching pads: Surrounded by objects that I treasure, I always feel at home, and at the same time I am transported to Europe on a daily basis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KO6EGEG9GX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161689279X#wasThisHelpful","R3KO6EGEG9GX6","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nature always bats last.That old warning about our degrading environment no longer seems to apply. Now Nature bats every day. Drought, storms, melting ice and rising oceans  the bad news is relentless.Where is the global effort to save the planet? Stalled. And we all know why: In Congress, 133 Republicans in the House of Representatives and 30 Republicans in the Senate  and, in our civilian population, many evangelical Christians, Republicans and Red State conservatives  are deniers. It doesnt matter to them that, of 2,000 peer-reviewed papers on climate change, 97% cited human activity as a primary cause. The unholy marriage of Big Money and Big Energy has bought the political process. Politicians get paid now; later, well all pay.In 'Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming,' Naomi Oreskes and science journalist Erik M. Conway delivered news that shocked me: how the same experts who once said that cigarettes dont cause cancer are now telling us that people arent a primary cause of climate change. That book is now a documentary film that will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival.So how does a Harvard professor  Oreskes, a longtime professor at the University of California, San Diego, is now Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences  follow up a groundbreaking book?With science fiction.In The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future, Oreskes and Conway tell the story of the next 80 years. Its a short story  just 52 pages, plus another 50 of definitions and a Q&A  and its fiction only in the sense that its speculation.Or is it?The authors describe their essay as a blend of science and fiction; they imagine a future historian looking back on a past that is our present and (possible) future. This is not a trick: By the early 2000s, dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system was under way. Fires, floods, hurricanes, and heat waves began to intensify. Still, these effects were discounted. The children of the Enlightenment had the facts. They knew what was coming. But they failed to act.This book tells how Western culture (1540-2093) ended.Start with carbon. About 365 billion metric tons of carbon were released into the atmosphere by 2012  more than half of that after the 1970s, when scientists built the first computer models connecting greenhouses gases to warming. In 2005, the U.S. Energy Act exempted shale gas drilling from regulation. Massive drilling followed. Canada began exploiting oil fields in Alberta. The results were predictable: accelerated loss of Arctic ice. In 2007, the Northwest Passage completely opened. In business and economic circles it was viewed as creating opportunities for further oil and gas exploration.And after that? Rock and roll. By 2040, heat waves and droughts were the norm. And then but you can guess that life-as-we-know-it dramatically changes.The Collapse of Western Civilization is the clearest, shortest explanation of the science of climate change and its consequences Ive seen. That its a slam dunk on denialism doesnt matter; the deniers will never concede. What it just might do is activate informed but defeatist Americans to join with causes like Moms Clean Air Force, a national movement of more than 380,000 mothers (and fathers) founded by Dominique Browning to protect our childrens right to clean air as politicians and lobbyists conspire to gut the Clean Air Act and dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency.I underlined a great deal of the book. And then I had the kind of questions for Naomi Oreskes that you might want to ask.Jesse Kornbluth: Youre an academic. Why write this as science fiction?Naomi Oreskes: It wasnt so much science fiction, as the idea of writing from the future, that captured my imagination. I spend my professional life thinking about other people: What were they thinking? So it was an obvious step to ask: What will future historians say about us?JK: In science fiction we often find descriptions of the future. In ""The Space Merchants,"" for example, by 2050 only the fortunate can enjoy hundreds of acres of rooftops where men and women could walk around in the open air, wearing simple soot-extractor nostril plugs instead of a bulky oxygen helmet. You dont present the change in our lives in such vivid descriptions. I think the worst you say is that, by 2040, the droughts are so intense that animals die and the rich in the West mourn their pet cats and dogs. Could you predict how we might be forced in to live in 2040?NO: We were careful not to offer details that might be refuted in the near future. I hope to still be around in 2040 (just). And Eriks a few years younger than me, so he expects to be around too.JK: You write: Knowledge did not translate into power. You write from the perspective of 2093, but many of us feel this now, and not just about climate change. You dont deal with this, but on a human level, how do you suggest we deal with this impotence  I mean, beyond self-medicating?NO: Indeed. Much of this story is what meteorologists call persistence forecasting  assuming that present trends will continue. How do we deal with it? Well, since our first book was about denial, its natural for Erik Conway and I to think that a first step is to talk about what is going on. The second step  solutions  well, I guess I think that has to operate on two levels. One is personal: we do what we can, whether its writing about the problem, becoming active in our communities, or putting solar PV on our roof. (Yes, Ive done all three). The other is political. We have to start thinking about this as a larger political problem. I think the organization Green for All is quite interesting in this respect. Also former Congressmans Bob Inglisss group. They have some interesting things to say. Id love to see Bob Ingliss and Bill McKibben get together for a conversation about the politics of climate change.JK: In your history of the future, the first big breakthrough doesnt come until 2090, when a Chinese scientist develops a fungus that efficiently eats CO2. Why so late?NO: Well, thats sort of the point, isnt it? The techno-fix comes too late.JK: You write that Books are like a message in a bottle. What message will your ideal reader take away?NO: That is its time to act? But I dont like to tell my readers what to think. One of the really neat things about writing is the ideas your readers come up with on their own.JK: You write of the awesome power of market fundamentalism  the dogma that the invisible hand of unregulated markets is always the best path. Given the omnipotence of this idea in politics, business and media, is it possible that well ever have a President who is not the bitch of Big Energy and Big Money?NO: If I continue on the persistence forecasting metaphor, Id have to say no. But stranger things have happened.JK: Why is the narrator Chinese?NO: Someone had to survive to tell the tale. But the most important reason is really the key message of the book: that centralized, authoritarian governments are going to be more prepared to deal with serious climate disruption. So if you care about democracy, you ought to be very motivated to do something now to prevent disruptive climate change. This is the point that the merchants of doubt got completely backward, and that folks at the CATO Institute and places like that still dont seem to comprehend.JK: If you were president  or, better, omnipotent ruler  what three changes in our energy and social policy would you change first?NO: Easy. A hefty carbon tax to put a real price on the external cost of carbon, and create a market signal that would encourage efficiency and innovation. Return half of that money directly to the American people. Use the other half to fund serious research into energy storage, carbon capture and storage, improved transportation system, and a host of other small and medium scale solutions that already exist, but arent economic or dont yet operate on the scale we need. We dont need a technological miracle to solve this problem, but we do need to stop dithering, stop denying the problem, and stop the wishful thinking that says that the magic of the marketplace will somehow solve this without any investment on our parts.JK: Who are the 10 people who most need to read this book  and then be tested on their comprehension?NO: Ah. I think the Head Butler should answer that question. The downstairs staff always knows best what the folks upstairs dont know. Wasnt that the lesson of all those British costume dramas?JK: I like to think that culture, not politics, creates change. You quote Leonard Cohen: We asked for signs. The signs were sent. If every artist made just one piece of art about impending climate disaster, would that make a difference? Or is there something we, as individuals, can do  like urging universities and others to divest their portfolios of investments in oil companies  to tip global opinion toward action, rebellion, whatever?NO: I think we need an all of the above strategy  but that means all forms of social and political action, not all forms of fossil fuels! I would very much like to see more artists get involved in this issue. Culture and politics are of course inter-related. And economics. I support divestment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B76N7XCTQDBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=023116954X#wasThisHelpful","R1B76N7XCTQDBJ","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sao Vicente is one of the Cape Verde islands, 350 miles off the coast of Senegal. These ten small islands are so wind-blasted and desolate that they were uninhabited until 1462. Four centuries of exploitation followed. And Cape Verde's poverty has continued to be so severe that over a third of its million citizens live abroad.It was Cesaria Evora's fate to be born there. Geography was destiny for her --- her voice was the living soul of Cape Verde. Given its history and culture, you really couldn't expect the islands' muse to fill her CDs with songs that make you want to dance.In fact, Cesaria Evora's specialty was morna, an intensely melancholy, minor-key music, sung mostly in Portuguese. But for Evora, Cape Verde's musical tradition was only the first reason that her songs were odes to longing and regret. Although she was a local star by 20, she never left the islands until she was in her mid-forties, when she finally made her first recordings.It wasn't until her 50s that she became the darling of the world-music crowd. She still performed shoeless, to express her solidarity with her impoverished countrymen. She still stopped singing in mid-concert to sit at a small table and smoke a cigarette. And she never veered from the music she'd made for decades; the last thing on her mind, it seemed, was mass success.I interviewed her when she was 60. Her English wasn't strong, so she brought along a translator. After a while, we switched to French --- easier for her, harder for me. But her irony and wit came through quite clearly.JK: When you're onstage and you take that cigarette break, you seem a million miles away. Are you?CE: No. I'm taking a break because I'm addicted to cigarettes. So I relax and enjoy it.JK: In a rare upbeat song, you sing, ""God gave us the world to live happily in."" Do you live happily?CE: I'm not a sad person. But in life, there are so many moments when you have to be sad. It's all in the moment.JK: I read that you've been left by three husbands. And then you said, ""No man shall ever sleep again under my roof."" True?CE: I've never married. I've had three kids with different men. And I still like men. And what I'm sure I said was ""I don't have a husband with me all the time.""JK: You stopped singing for ten years. How painful was that?CE: Not. I was working and not getting any results, so I decided to stop. In '85, I got some work, so I started again.JK: What is a day like for you in Cape Verde?CE: I have a completely normal life. I take care of my house, I visit with family and friends. At night I sometimes go out. Whatever the rest of the world may think of me now, I was always considered a great singer at home. But we all know each other. There's no ""stardom"" in Cape Verde.The last time I saw Evora in concert, she came onstage in a simple dress and delivered two dozen exquisitely mournful songs. Then, for the final encore, the band played with an energy and rhythm that was first cousin to the Cuban jazz of the Buena Vista Social Club.The crowd was on its feet, hands over heads, clapping and dancing. The only person in the theater who seemed unmoved was Evora, who stood apart, stolidly accepting their love.At last, she spoke just two words: ""Obligado. Termine."" And then she permitted herself one small, delicious shimmy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGAS1SE45YUX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UH3RIW#wasThisHelpful","RGAS1SE45YUX3","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1967, a year when 11,153 body bags would come home, 467 arrived in the United States in October. That month, like everyone else I knew, I went to Washington to protest; I watched peaceful people beaten and arrested, with not a mention of it in most newspapers. The culture was just as split. In greater America, ""To Sir with Love"" was the #1 song that month; in New York, ""Hair"" opened off-Broadway.Bob Dylan? That month, he was in Nashville, recording a new album.The first session, on October 17, lasted three hours; out of it came master takes of ""I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"" ""Drifter's Escape"" and ""The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest."" On November 6, Dylan knocked off ""All Along the Watchtower,"" ""John Wesley Harding,"" ""As I Went Out One Morning,"" ""I Pity the Poor Immigrant"" and ""I Am a Lonesome Hobo."" Late the next month, Dylan finished the album.Twelve hours in the studio for 40 minutes of music --- there's no comparison in all of American music.And that's just the start of What's Exceptional about ""John Wesley Harding.""On December 27, 1967 --- a month after he finished recording, in the dead week between Christmas and New Year --- Columbia released the album. Promotion? None. A single? Not. Still, Dylan fans found it and snapped it up. And then it went away, until Jimi Hendrix plucked one song from it. ""Two riders were approaching. The wind began to howl."" And did it ever:I can understand why ""John Wesley Harding"" may not be in your Dylan collection. It came after three of the greatest albums ever recorded: ""Bringing It All Back Home,"" ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and ""Blonde on Blonde."" Then there was Dylan's motorcycle accident. And a long silence. And then this --- not quite a country album, though there were tendencies. With lyrics that teased and challenged: stripped-down story songs, vaguely Biblical in theme.And not one word about Vietnam, drugs, hippies or the chasm between old and young.I listened obsessively to ""John Wesley Harding"" that winter, and as the man says in one song, ""I bowed my head and cried."" First, for the artistic achievement; Dylan had, yet again, turned his back on his past and made something completely unexpected and contrarian. But even more for what I thought Dylan was saying. He'd taken a giant step back from everything contemporary and looked deeply into what mattered. What he found was scary, exhilarating, desperately important --- and absolutely relevant to what was happening.Almost half a century later, I'm again listening obsessively to ""John Wesley Harding."" I am a slow thinker, so it took me a while to figure out why --- of all the music I could be playing, this is the most relevant I know. The reason is right at the start of the first song: ""John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor..."" The whole album is shot through with references to losers: hoboes, immigrants, drifters. In short, everyone excluded from the national conversation right now. And then, even though you and I are still lucky enough to matter, the line we can all understand: ""Dear landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.""If I make this sound heavy as German philosophy, I do my cause no favors here. The fact is, this is a fantastic listening experience, especially if you're listening through earphones. The band --- Charles McCoy (bass), Kenny Buttrey (drums) and Pete Drake (steel guitar) --- was amazed at Dylan's speed and self-assurance. Kenny Buttrey: ""We went in and knocked 'em out like demos."" True, but these were the best studio players in Nashville. And the producer was the legendary Bob Johnston.And we are, after all, talking about our Shakespeare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C3DS19FC3H92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00026WU5U#wasThisHelpful","R3C3DS19FC3H92","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have praised all seven of the annual editions of the Canal House cookbooks. I raved about their magnum opus, Canal House Cooks Every Day, well before Christopher Hirsheimer and Melissa Hamilton won the James Beard award. I come now to press upon you volume eight, ""Canal House Pronto!""This time I have a modest gripe.My affection for Christopher and Melissa goes beyond my admiration for their books. It's personal. Late in life, I have started to collect fascinating, super smart, big hearted women. I think of them as sisters -- women I love, but not in ""that way.""The Canal House women are major members of that sorority, and they know it.So when they went to Italy to collect recipes for this book, would it have killed them to bring along a butler? I would have carried their luggage. Chopped the onions. Served dinner. Protected them from Italian men.But no -- Christopher and Melissa went to Italy, and all I got is this terrific cookbook.For those who are new to Canal House, a quick history. They call themselves ""home cooks."" That's like Paul Simon describing himself in a song as ""an ordinary player in the key of C."" Christopher Hirsheimer was one of the founders of Saveur Magazine. She has co-authored four cookbooks and taken the photographs for thirty more. Melissa Hamilton co-founded a restaurant, did a stint at Cook's Illustrated and ran the test kitchen at Saveur before becoming its food editor.Something happened to Hirsheimer and Hamilton when they moved to little towns across the river from one another in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Fresh produce, of course. But also a gentler pace. They found a loft overlooking a canal and opened a studio: Canal House. Their description is poetry:""Our loft studio is in an old red brick warehouse. A beautiful lazy canal runs alongside the building. We have a simple galley kitchen.

The term acqua pazza (""crazy water"" in Italian) refers to both the dish and the poaching broth, which is stained red from tomatoes and aromatic with garlic and herbs. It's one of those satisfying dishes, like San Francisco's cioppino, created by fishermen who would make it on board with their catch of the day and a few other simple ingredients. We like to use black sea bass or red snapper, but any non-oily white fish will do nicely.1 pound ripe plum tomatoes1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes1/2 cup dry white wine3 sprigs fresh oregano1 bunch fresh parsleySalt and pepper4 black sea bass or red snapper filets (about 4 ounces each)Quarter the tomatoes lengthwise. Working over a sieve set over a bowl, scoop out the tomato seeds with your fingers. Put the tomatoes in the bowl with any of the strained juice and discard the seeds in the sieve.Heat the olive oil in a large saut pan over medium-low heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until the oil is fragrant and well-flavored yet the garlic remains pale blonde, 3-4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice, the wine, oregano, half of the parsley, and 4 cups cool water. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and simmer the broth until it is slightly reduced, 15-20 minutes.Chop the remaining parsley leaves (discarding the stems). Add the parsley, a generous pinch of salt, and some pepper to the broth. Season the fish filets with salt, then place them skin side up in the simmering broth (the fish will not be submerged). Cook until the fish is opaque, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Remove and discard the sprigs of oregano and parsley.Use a fish spatula to arrange the fish flesh side up on a deep serving platter or on 4 deep plates. Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings. Spoon the tomatoes and broth over the fish and drizzle with some olive oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3841DEY3FPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982739486#wasThisHelpful","RN3841DEY3FPF","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Hampton knew everything. He'd read it. He'd seen it. He'd heard it. And because he had some kind of trick memory, everything he knew was instantly available to him. It was thrilling to be his friend, to learn about art and books and design from him.And more: I met the Hampton daughters when they were in their teens, and promptly adopted Duane and Mark's parenting philosophy (take the kids everywhere, don't marginalize them at a kiddie table). Several apartments later, my library still lives in bookcases that Mark designed. I have seen Kate act since she was in school plays. Alexa, who took over her father's firm after his death, consulted on our last apartment; the chintz curtains she had made for us there don't work in our new one, but I took them with us, just because.And now, all these years later, I'm writing about Alexa.In case you suspect I might be a stenographer for the Hamptons -- I did, after all, review Duane's book, ""Mark Hampton: An American Decorator"" -- I'm actually a book behind. I failed to write a full review of Alexa's first book, ""Alexa Hampton: The Language of Interior Design,"" which breaks design down into 4 elements and presents 18 examples as a sensible tutorial.Now comes ""Decorating in Detail,"" a picture and text book that takes you, in considerable detail, through seven homes that Alexa has decorated. They are not McMansions. They're not small. They are, in a word, not the kind of spaces that you and I occupy or may want to.This doesn't mean you can't learn from the residences of the rich -- in fairness to the 1%, they're at least smart enough to know they can't decorate for themselves so they choose a designer on the level of Alexa Hampton. You just have to look at these houses and apartments with a critical eye and a sharp sense of personal taste.As  Alexa says, ""One of the biggest mistakes people make is to try to copy something expensive on the cheap, which inevitably ends up looking cheap... Only do what is appropriate for the budget you have."" And she's clear that the decorator's art has limits. What makes a home, she says, are books and art. Without them, you've got nothing more than... a showroom.So you're looking here, as the title suggests, at the little things that, if missed, become annoying flaws. Hanging curtains. (Think this is small? We debated this for weeks until an artist friend pointed out that the higher the curtain, the higher the ceiling will appear.) Lighting. Fabrics. Closets. Kitchens. Where you want lamps. Color as theme and as accent.As it happens, I wrote about one of these homes for Architectural Digest. It was charming. The owners had an idea, and Alexa Hampton delivered it. Improved on it, in truth, and not in some grand way -- the use of an upstairs hall as an office for the kids is just plain smart. Practical smart.One other tip. To start to create like Alexa Hampton, take pictures of your home. Get a Sharpie. Draw sketches over the pictures of what you'd like your rooms to become. For less than a dollar, you're on your way. That simple? If Alexa Hampton is to be believed, once you grasp some key precepts, it can be. Almost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FH07MA7WIHEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956857#wasThisHelpful","R2FH07MA7WIHEG","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eric Clapton called him the ""greatest blues guitarist ever.""On his first trip to England, Rod Stewart volunteered to be his valet.Jimi Hendrix said of him, ""Heaven is lying at his feet while listening to him play guitar.""The musician that these giants raved about --- and women adored --- is less famous than he ought to be. But how, with such praise, can that be? Second-rate talents with decent marketing and a bit of luck are famous, at least for a while --- if Buddy Guy is among the greats, why don't we know him, why can't we name any of his hits?In part, because Buddy Guy is the king of Chicago blues, a genre at once rough and tender, down-home and ultra-knowing, and, at its core, black as the skin of the darkest field hand in Mississippi --- and thus not of interest to the mass audience until some skinny white guy is stroking that Fender six-string Stratocaster.And, in part, because Guy and his producers botched his career. He came to Chicago from Louisiana: ""I was so far out in the country, man. We didn't have running water, no electric lights, no radio, and I didn't know nothing about no electric guitar. We used to get the catalogs, like from Sears, and that's how our mother would order our clothes. Didn't have no stores there to buy clothes from.""He started  playing professionally in Baton Rouge, won a contest, headed north. In the early 1960s, when some of the best Chicago blues records were made, he was a session guitarist; anything fancy he played was mixed down.By the mid-l960s, Buddy Guy was Jimi Hendrix before there was a Hendrix; he would pick the guitar with his teeth and play it over his head. (One night Hendrix came, stood in the front row and taped Guy's performance so he could go to school on it.)At the same time, Buddy Guy was Clapton before there was a Clapton. In fact, the young British bluesman got the idea for Cream as a power trio from Buddy Guy. And as for Cream's music, well.... ""You know that Cream tune, `Strange Brew'?"" Guy has recalled. ""Eric and I were having a drink one day, and I said, `Man, that Strange Brew... you just cracked me up with that note.' And he said `You should...'cause it's your licks.'""By the time anyone in Chicago understood or appreciated what Buddy Guy was playing, others had patented that sound. He made a few authentic Chicago records, then languished without a record contract for a decade. By the time of his third or fourth rediscovery, he was old enough to be a grandfather --- and by then, he had moved beyond pure blues to a kind of showmanship that upstaged the music.But there was a window --- a few years in the mid-l960s --- when Buddy Guy had it all: a powerful set of songs, masterful compatriots, a willing record label. You can hear him in those glory days as the wingman for Junior Wells in that harmonica player's electrifying and flawless Hoodoo Man Blues. (For contractual reasons, he's billed on early editions of that record as ""Friendly Chap."") And then, in 1968, he made a debut record that is nothing less than a primer of Chicago blues.On ""A Man and the Blues,"" the music has been mixed so Buddy Guy is front and center, and he is never less than dazzling. He plays a single note and lets it hang until it drops out of hearing range. Or he'll rain notes down like bullets, a staccato assault on your ears. But he never plays anything just for show --- everything is in the service of the song. And he's backed by great musicians, especially Fred Below on drums and Otis Spann on piano. Here's a challenge: On slower songs, tune everyone else out and listen to what Spann and Below are playing. It may be blues, but it's as least as subtle as jazz.There are fast songs that get toes tapping and the heart pumping, especially the Motown hit ""Money (That's What I Want)"" and ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" But it's the slow stuff that takes your breath away. ""What can a man do/when the blues keep following him around?"" he asks. ""So many ways you can get the blues,"" he moans. He's sitting ""a million miles from nowhere"" in a shack by the cotton fields. But he's a man. And so he looks for a man's solution: ""I'm gonna find me some kind of good woman/Even if she's dumb, deaf, crippled or blind.""It's lonely, lonely stuff --- it's the very definition of the blues. ""Give me a little piano now, Spann,"" he cries, and in comes a glissando as delicate as Chopin and twice as heartbreaking. Makes you want to reach for a cigarette and a whiskey, even if you don't smoke or drink.Don't feel sorry for Buddy Guy --- over the years, he's sold millions of records, won Grammys, achieved the status of a legend. One of the last, in fact; pushing 70, he's the sole survivor of the Chicago greats. No, the sorrow is for us; ""A Man and the Blues"" should have spawned a half dozen albums that would have given us a catalogue as rich as that of John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters.Before he left home, Buddy Guy's father told him, ""Son, don't be the best in town. Just be the best until the best come around."" But no one I can think of has ever come around with anything better than ""A Man and the Blues.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZ8IKUWTQ8V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000EJW#wasThisHelpful","R2IZ8IKUWTQ8V3","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The baseball novels of John R. Tunis are not only the best sports fiction for 10-to-14 year-olds ever written, they are among the best sports fiction --- period.I should know. At age 8, I read my first Tunis novel. By age 10, I'd read them all. In my 20s, I revisited my childhood favorite --- the first book in the series, ""The Kid from Tomkinsville"" --- and found it held up admirably.John R. Tunis (1889-1975) is not a name to conjure with these days, but in his time, he was the leading writer of teen sports stories. He surely had the credentials: in the late 1920s, he covered sports for a New York newspaper, then moved on to cover tennis for NBC. And then he moved into fiction, starting with ""The Kid from Tomkinsville,"" published in 1940.The Kid is Roy Tucker, a pitcher from a little town in Connecticut. He's working at MacKenzie's drug store ""on the corner of South Main"" and pitching local ball when a scout from the Brooklyn Dodgers shows up to watch another player. He ends up signing Roy.Roy's parents are dead, and he's living with his grandmother, and a big winter storm blows the roof off her farmhouse -- that first check from the Dodgers comes in handy. At Spring Training, Roy continues to be the Good Kid; he hopes to impress the manager enough to be sent to some farm club so he can give his grandmother more money than he'd be getting at the drug store.There's a veteran catcher at spring training --- Dave Leonard, hoping to hang on so he can make $12,500 for a few seasons until his insurance kicks in. Dave gives Roy a few magic tips, among them:""Son, an old umpire once give me some dope when I was breaking in like you. Oh, yeah, I thought I was hot stuff, but they soon showed me I didn't have an idea what it was all about. Just when I got convinced I was a flop and waiting for that pink slip in the mail box, this old fella took me aside in the lobby of the hotel one night. Old George Connors, I never forgot. So I pass it along to you and don't you forget it either. 'Courage,' says this old-timer. 'Courage is all life. Courage is all baseball. And baseball is all life; that's why it gets under your skin.'""Roy has courage, and soon enough Roy has technique. And Roy becomes a rookie sensation, first in spring training and then in the regular season. But after a game, some players are horsing around in the showers. Someone bumps Roy. He falls, lands on his arm, and suddenly the career of the phenom who has won 16 games is a row is over.Baseball's a funny game, full of life lessons you can't see when they're coming at you. Dave Leonard gets cut from the team. Then the player-manager gets killed in a car crash, and Dave is brought back to manage the slumping Dodgers. He knows Roy is a natural hitter, so he keeps him on the team and uses him as a pinch hitter. And Roy has great success --- in a single season, he's on his second career.Then comes the inevitable slump. Roy's ready to quit. Dave gives him a tough-love lecture: ""Only the game fish swim upstream."" And Roy, reinvigorated, embarks on yet another comeback.The baseball scenes are as exciting as great newspaper reports of hotly contested games. There are passages that take you inside the game of baseball, and then deeper, into the minds of the men who play it. Does it matter that this book is set in the late 1930s, and Joe DiMaggio is a feared opponent and Roy's grandmother still uses coal in her oven? Not at all --- anyone who loves baseball will be rooting for Roy so fervently that this might as well be non-fiction. (As Tunis puts it in a note at the start of the book, ""The author wishes to state that all the characters in this book were drawn from real life."")It's the blend of utter fantasy --- a rookie who helps lead the Dodgers into a World Series against the Yankees --- and no-nonsense realism that earns this series a permanent place in baseball literature. If you've got a kid who cares about baseball, ""The Kid from Tomkinsville"" is a gift from God; it will set him (or her) on the path of more great Tunis novels.And if you are looking for respite from this jaded world of ours --- if you're nostalgic for the crack of the bat and the snap of ball against leather and the look of raked dirt against pristine grass --- these books will revive you like no others I know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFV919H4TEIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0152056416#wasThisHelpful","R1TFV919H4TEIM","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The photograph on the cover doesn't suggest how short they both were, how small. All you notice is their elegance, her pleated skirt just so, his hands shoved casually in the jacket pockets of his natty double-breasted suit. Their gaze is direct. Confident. Elegant.But there's something the photo doesn't catch.  Michael Arlen --- author of a novel called  ""The Green Hat"" --- may be more successful than his friends F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. But Michael Arlen isn't who he looks like; he was born Dikran Kouyoumdjian, an Armenian. In London, he won't fit in. Ditto in New York and the South of France. And his wife isn't exactly who she looks like either.Exiles. So their son, Michael J. Arlen, thinks of them. Exiles? How can that be --- they had it all. Michael Arlen's photograph was on the cover of Time Magazine. In the South of France, he owned the very best speedboat and hired a driver for it. Willie Maugham and Winston Churchill came for lunch. ""The day he arrived in Chicago, the Daily News ran a front-page story --- saying that he had arrived in Chicago."" But when the fame went away, he was beached.Michael J. Arlen gets the glitter. And, even more, the courage that kept his father going. He tells the delicious story of his father running into Louis B. Mayer, the movie mogul, at the ""21"" Club in New York. Arlen had just arrived from England; Mayer asked about his plans. ""I was just talking to Sam Goldwyn,"" Arlen said --- which was true, he'd just encountered Mayer's rival, who had urged him to buy horses. Mayer asked, ""How much did he offer you?"" Arlen thought fast: ""Not enough."" A few minutes later, he had a 30-week contract as a writer at MGM for $1,500 a week.Michael Arlen wants to be a father to his son, so he invites the boy out to California. There's a weekend in Santa Barbara. At Clark Gable's house. Only Gable's not there. It's a house party of tanned men and attractive women. Of cigarettes and liquor. And a terrible moment when his father is talking --- and nobody's listening. Later, the boy finds his father sitting by the pool. ""I was out here a long time ago,"" his father said. ""We used to play tennis. Thalberg --- he always wanted to talk about literature.""These are people of a breed long vanished, and their lives will seem strange. The big duplex apartment. Long lunches. Cocktail time. Sitting in the library at night, reading and drinking. And the sadness: young Michael hearing his father in the afternoon, not writing, just pacing, pacing. Here's his mother, dying, her last words coming across decades, from Monte Carlo: ""Let's take the road down by the sea this time. It will be longer, but nothing really starts until ten anyway...""Other stories are right out of Salinger or John O'Hara. Young Michael, at boarding school, not winning and then winning a history prize. Michael, a senior at Harvard, desperate to marry his 19-year-old girlfriend. Their parents don't approve. Oh, the agony, ""the back-seat-of-the car fifteen floors above Park Avenue."" And, a little later, Michael, frustrated, making a phone call and getting a job in the Henry Luce empire.I haven't mentioned the writing. I think this book is right up there with the stories of James Salter, but some will find it falsely casual, like talking, but like a very self-conscious voice talking. Maybe. Consider where Michael J. Arlen came from. And consider, too, that this is an elegy, and elegies should shine. Like this:""They were both of them beautiful. They were also, both of them, in a kind of exile, and sought to find a home, a country, in one another, and very nearly did, came as close to it as maybe it is possible to do, but they were each so deep in exile when they met --- and how would they have known that? My mother, so seemingly established --- a title, even, money somewhere in the background, big houses, gardens, furniture, wax for the furniture, polish for the silver, manners, style, and more than manners or style, a seeming feel for independence.... and seeking to escape from her (still unknown) exile, from all those mannered, self-protective people into this unusual man's vitality, life, imagination, energy --- well, as with many men, it turned out to be a fragile, an especially fragile kind of energy. So delicate, really. Too delicate. But that was for later, for much later. It was later that they found these things out, or didn't find them out, just lived them, lived under them. In the beginning, though, it must have been lovely....""Tastes differ.

"The 50th anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy brings out the hustlers. You can't blame them. This is their last chance at a big payday. When the Boomers were young and impressionable, they looked up to a movie star President and his goddess wife; they regard the President's murder as the first and biggest tragedy of their lives. And this is their last hurrah; they're getting old. Now, for what may well be the last time, they'll ask the questions that have have fed historians and conspiracy for five decades: Was Lee Harvey Oswald the only assassin? Why did he want to kill Kennedy? Was the government's investigation a cover-up?In the media orgy surrounding this anniversary, I trust one writer.I met Edward Jay Epstein in 1967, a few months after he published ""Inquest: The Warren Commission and the Establishment of Truth."" In his book, Epstein asked very simple questions: ""What was the Commission trying to do? What resources did it have to do the job it chose? Who did the work? How was the work done, and how well was it done?""The answers he got were fascinating. For me, Epstein was even more interesting. I was then a 20 year-old junior in college, working as a researcher and journalist in the summers. Here was a writer who, at the time he did his interviewing, was a 26 year-old college student. And yet this amateur had done what no professional journalist or historian had attempted --- he interviewed all the members but one of the government commission that investigated the assassination of President Kennedy.Ed Epstein has written 15 books on subjects as diverse as diamonds, the CIA and Hollywood. He has returned twice to the Kennedy assassination. In 1978, he published ""Legend: The Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald."" And now he has published ""The JFK Assassination Diary: My Search for Answers to the Mystery of the Century.""I trust Ed Epstein because throughout his long and distinguished career he has focused on facts. In a sea of conspiracy theorists, he's a consummate researcher, a cool analyst, an unemotional writer. If you're hoping to learn about the second gunman on the grassy knoll or the CIA's plot to kill Kennedy or the Mafia hitman, his new book --- and this interview --- will disappoint you. If you're looking for a voice of sanity, read on....JK: You began your investigation half a century ago when you were an undergraduate at Cornell. Why?EJE: I had dropped out. When I was re-admitted in January of 1964, I had the opportunity to get both an undergraduate and masters degree by writing a thesis. As I had lost touch with political science, the only topic I could think of was the Warren Commission.JK: You got to see almost everyone involved with the Warren Commission. How was that possible?EJE: I simply wrote a letter to the members. To my surprise, every member answered. This was before the age of PR, before government bodies had spokesmen, before people involved in commissions like this were sworn to secrecy.JK: It boggles the mind that a kid with no credentials interviewed these key sources --- but no journalists did. How do you explain this?EJE: I can't. I suspect that no journalist tried because journalists assumed it was a state secret.JK: What good deed did Chief Justice Earl Warren --- who wouldn't be interviewed --- do for you?EJE: The Chief Justice did me an enormous service b y recommending that I see the chief counsel, J. Lee Rankin. That opened the doors to the lawyers, who gave me their files. No one had ever seen an FBI report on a sensitive subject, but I got the FBI summary reports.JK: Did anyone you interviewed think there was a ""conspiracy"" to kill Kennedy?EJE: John J. McCloy, the former high commissioner of Germany, believed it was possible Oswald acted on behalf of others, or at least that the possibility could not be precluded. He thought Oswald may have been a sleeper agent who went haywire, and he was intrigued by a letter that Oswald wrote to the Soviet Embassy 10 days before the assassination. In that letter Oswald mentioned he had a meeting in Mexico City with Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, a KGB officer (Oswald referred to him as ""comrade Kostin""). Oswald wrote that he had not been able to ""complete our business"" because he had been unable ""to reach the Soviet Embassy in Havana as planned. I could not take a chance on requesting a new visa unless I used my real name, so I returned to the United States."" McCloy told me the letter reeked of intrigue.JK: Did the Commission rush to judgment?EJE: Yes. As the memos I obtained clearly showed, the Commission rushed to meet a deadline imposed by Lyndon Johnson, even though the lawyers who were conducting the investigation told Warren they didn't have enough time to resolve important issues.JK: What did the Commission miss?EJE: The Commission missed the autopsy color photographs showing the path of the bullet. They failed to demonstrate how Oswald could have fired three accurate shots because, to do so, they needed to do another reconstruction in November 1964 when the foliage was identical. But they couldn't wait until November because LBJ demanded that the report be published in September 1964. And they missed finding out about the CIA plots to kill Castro.JK: What did you learn that no one else did then, and has that information been confirmed by others?EJE: George de Mohrenschildt --- who died an hour after I interviewed him --- told me that the CIA knew about Oswald's attempt to assassinate General Walker. The CIA never confirmed that. I learned that the Warren Commission investigation of crucial areas was truncated, which was confirmed by the payroll records I obtained. I learned the autopsy photographs were missing, which was confirmed by Congressional investigations.JK: Your view is that Oswald killed JFK and that he acted alone. Why did he want to kill JFK?EJE: My view that Oswald fired the fatal bullet is based on ballistics. I remain open to the possibility he shot JFK at the behest of others. After all, he was in contact with the Cuban Embassy less than 8 weeks before the assassination, and one week before he went underground in Dallas. Castro had warned the US that US leaders would not be safe if plots against him continued. So Oswald might have been carrying out Castro's threat.JK: What don't you know that you'd like to know?EJE: I don't know what happened in the Cuban embassy in the last week of September 1963. I spoke to Sylvia Duran, an embassy official, who told me that Oswald got in a shouting match with the Consul. According to what Castro later told an FBI double agent, Oswald talked about killing JFK. He later met with Duran outside the embassy, and his Cuban visa, 5 weeks before the assassination, was conditionally approved. So I would like to know if Oswald was informed of this approval in Dallas and what ""business"" at the Cuban embassy Oswald was referring to in his letter to the Soviet embassy.The 110 pages of ""The JFK Assassination Diary: My Search for Answers to the Mystery of the Century"" amplify these answers. I find them compelling. And credible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SP9EAITS1DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492831506#wasThisHelpful","R27SP9EAITS1DN","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new Zagat guide rates Gramercy Tavern as New York's second most popular restaurant.It is, says Zagat, ""about as perfect as a restaurant can get.""Gramercy Tavern has now produced its first cookbook.I was invited to meet Michael Anthony, the restaurant's executive chef-partner, at a small lunch for food writers in a private dining room.Who wouldn't go?The menu was Red Kuri Squash Soup with Brussels Sprouts and Apples; Cauliflower with Quinoa, Prunes and Peanuts; Porgy with Spaghetti Squash and Sherry Sauce; and, for dessert, Peanut Butter Semifreddo with Chocolate Macaroon and Hot Fudge.There were flowers on the table, with small vegetables --- artichokes, peppers and okra --- placed among them so cleverly that it took me two courses to notice. The service was swift, silent, impeccable, which I expected; what surprised me was that one of the staffers clearing our plates was the restaurant's managing partner.Michael Anthony spoke briefly about the menu. The soup, he noted, was cooked in a single pot. The cauliflower was a separate course because he regarded vegetables as ""shining stars."" Porgy, he noted, was ""a simple, inexpensive fish.""The idea, I gathered, was that these were dishes we could, using his cookbook, make at home.With every blissful, three-star bite, I thought: Get real.Michael Anthony is a boyish, unpretentious guy. On a quiz show, you'd never guess that in 2012 he won the James Beard Award for Best Chef in New York. His former employers in Paris include Jacques Cagna, Michel Gurard and L'Arpge. Before coming to Gramercy Tavern in 2006, he was executive chef of the celebrated Westchester restaurant, Blue Hill at Stone Barns.Michael Anthony is nobody's idea of a home cook.I said as much to Dorothy Kalins, godmother to first tier cookbook writers and producer of the Gramercy Tavern book.Her response: ""I knew you'd say that.""And she challenged me to cook a meal from the book.This was a tougher assignment than I anticipated --- once I opened the book, I could not put it down, for in addition to the recipes, there is a text as thrilling as, well, a thriller. Gramercy Tavern is a Danny Meyer restaurant, which means that it is really a brilliant play in which the characters just happen to create and serve astonishing meals. You don't work here, you are cast. And to win your part, you need more than skills; personality and attitude are equally important. This is a team that assumes greatness as a baseline but aims much, much higher. It's not a spiritual quest, but it's close.The book tells the history of the restaurant and profiles many of the people who work here. The stories inspire. Really, this book is a drug --- it  gets you high and makes you dream.Yes, but can you cook from it?I put myself to the ultimate test: I invited two friends for a dinner at which I'd serve an entre I'd never cooked before: Braised Lamb Shoulder with Broccoli Puree. The text described how Michael Anthony and his team prepare it. The labor is daunting, even for a restaurant staff. Then comes a simplified version for the home cook. I eliminated the broccoli puree and set to work. But it wasn't work. Braise meat. Chop vegetables. Cook in oven. Serve.Our guests were two of our most sophisticated friends. She's a queen in her field, and just as talented in the kitchen; when she comes to dinner, she arrives bearing gifts like homemade compote or a bottle of vodka she's flavored with herbs from her garden. He's a prolific, distinguished writer and broadcaster, a talker who makes Bono sound inept; in his presence, my conversation is limited to provocative questions.Dear readers, these titans were stupefied.""I can think of four houses in this country where I have eaten this well,"" he said.Here's the recipe, without the puree. See for yourself.Braised Lamb ShoulderServes 41 tablespoon olive oil1 2-pound boneless lamb shoulder, tied or cut into large cubessalt, pepper1 onion, chopped6 garlic cloves, minced2 shallots, minced1 carrot, chopped1 celery stalk, chopped tablespoon tomato paste cup red wine3 sprigs thyme1 sprig rosemary1 bay leaf5 cups chicken broth or waterPreheat the oven to 325 degrees.In a large, heavy, ovenproof pot with a lid, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the lamb with salt and pepper, add to the pot and brown well on all sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer the meat to a platter.Reduce the heat to medium. Add garlic, onion, shallots, carrots and celery to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a minute.Add the wine and stir, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen the browned bits. Simmer until the wine is almost gone. Patience! This is the magic moment for flavor.Return the lamb to the pot along with its accumulated juices. Add the thyme, rosemary, bay leaf and enough broth to almost cover the meat. Bring to a simmer over high heat, cover the pot and transfer it to the oven.Cook, turning once about halfway through, until the lamb is very tender, 2 to 2 and  hours. Transfer the meat to a cutting board.Pass the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a wide saucepan, pushing down on the solids with a spoon to extract every last bit of juice. Bring the liquid to a simmer and reduce until it has thickened. You should have about a cup of sauce; this can take 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Serve the lamb shoulder whole or in pieces. Coat the meat with some of the reduced sauce and serve.And swoon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCXV6HGZXH2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307888339#wasThisHelpful","R2DCXV6HGZXH2H","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first encountered Jacques Sandulescu, I was a pasty college kid whose idea of exertion involved a highlighter and a textbook. Jacques was twice my age, a giant, rock hard, with hands that swallowed pens whole. Romania was deep in his past, as was his career as a professional boxer; in l968, when we met, he was a Greenwich Village bar owner.Like Big Daddy Lipscomb --- the legendary giant of a football player who used to help opponents up ""so the children won't think Big Daddy's mean"" --- Jacques was a calming force in every room he entered. You couldn't imagine trouble erupting with him around; he was that big and strong. And, at the same time, peaceful --- he had the kind of calm only people who have passed through fire seem to know.It wasn't until I read his book that I understood the horror Jacques survived.""I was arrested in Brasov on my way to school,"" his book begins. And right there your stomach sinks. Because you know what's coming: a terrible story, told in unadorned prose.Well, brace yourself, you're about to be devastated.As ""Donbas"" opens, Jacques is 16 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, 180 pounds. He's the youngest person in the box car filled with Romanians that the Russians are shipping east in January of 1945. But his youth vanishes fast when he watches guards execute some would-be escapees. On one hand, he envies their death: ""no more cold, misery, hunger."" On the other, he wants to live. Which means he'll have to escape.This is a book about noticing everything, paying sharp attention, looking for an opening. His first conclusion: Don't try to escape in winter, don't think you can get out of Russia without knowing Russian.But after a few days of working in the coal mines of Donbas (now considered part of the Ukraine), his thoughts turn from escape to survival. The work is wet and cold. A cave-in could come at any time. Exhaustion, exposure, hunger --- death comes in many forms here.I have never read an account of work in a mine that made me so claustrophobic. I found myself reading faster, as if getting to the end of a particularly horrible shift would provide some relief. But it didn't --- above ground, there were sadistic guards and icy winds. ""Many prisoners died,"" Jacques reports matter-of-factly. ""Over half the camp. Four hundred and fifty weak and sick weren't suffering any more.""Jacques is comparatively well off. He is strong and uncomplaining, a good worker. He gets privileges --- when he goes to nearby homes for dinner, it's a delight to read as he eats and eats and eats. But he's never fooled; there's always a power-mad guard around the corner. And one does beat him so badly he almost dies. Which makes it all the more satisfying when, with the permission of a senior officer, Jacques stomps that sadist mercilessly. ""It was a good feeling while it lasted,"" he says. I think even a pacifist would agree.After two and a half years, his luck runs out. Jacques is trapped in a cave-in and rescued only by a friend's heroic efforts. He fears his legs will be amputated. It's winter, but so what --- he must escape. His legs are running with pus, he is a mass of sores, but he slips onto a train, hides in an open coal car and begins the slow, freezing ride to the West.Books like this have a built-in handicap --- we know the author survived. Only the best of the breed make us forget that there's a happy ending. And this is the best; reading these pages, you will feel cold and hungry, raging with fever, wet and dispirited. But mostly, you will feel Jacques Sandulescu's spirit, his unyielding insistence on life, life in free air, life at all costs. After you put his book down, you will, literally, take a deep breath.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQW9YE8QKA6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481137077#wasThisHelpful","R1TQW9YE8QKA6R","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karen Karbo is wide awake. Not only is every fact about her ostensible subject accessible to her, but so is every thought those facts inspire and every moment of her own experience. That kind of writing is invigorating. And fun --- Karen Karbo is fun, the person at the party you want to sit near because she's going to knock back a few drinks and tell terrific stories.She did this in ""The Gospel According to Coco Chanel: Life Lessons from the World's Most Elegant Woman"" and ""How Georgia Became O'Keeffe: Lessons on the Art of Living."" She may be in awe of those women, but that's not why she writes about them; she wants to unearth their secret wisdom. When she does, she bluntly shares. Her take on Chanel's philosophy of life: ""Cut to the chase, don't waste time doing stuff that seems essential to your life and business just because other people do it."" And O'Keefe's: ""The greatest aphrodisiac is vitality.""Karen Karbo grew up 15 miles from Julia Child's childhood home in Southern California. She knows what it means ""for her to go to France in her 30s as a Californian and hurl herself into French culture."" What's more remarkable about that reinvention is something Karbo knows and other writers forget to note: ""She was pretty average. When she was in school, she was an average student --- average to bad, actually, because the girl did love to party. Her philosophy at Smith was, `less study, more moonshine.' It wasn't like she had this fantastic aptitude for cooking; she just had a huge passion for cooking, and she was an enormous workaholic.""Karbo's title is literal --- the book is structured around ten of Julia's rules. The first is really the most important: total commitment: ""Julia was a devotee of anything that was risky, difficult, and had the potential for catastrophe."" Karbo amplifies:""Part of living with abandon is giving oneself over to one's circumstances without any expectation that things are going to be to our liking anytime soon. We can hope that things will improve, but it shouldn't prevent us from doing what we've set out to do. Julia had an astonishing capacity to be content with what was in front of her, whether it be a cooking school run on spit and a string or a less than perfect hunk of meat. She made do and moved on and rarely regretted it.""But enough of the high tone --- ""Julia Child Rules"" is a blast. ""If we could just have the kitchen and the bedroom, that would be all we need."" When Julia said that, she was 89! She loved the hot dogs at Costco. She never served hors d'oeuvres; her idea of pre-meal kibbles was Pepperidge Farm goldfish.There has to be a scene from Julia's legendary television show. Karbo chooses the one that has her preparing French onion soup. Julia chops vegetables, puts the casserole in the oven --- and removes a blackened casserole. It's a disaster. Burned. But Julia proclaims it table-ready: ""She reassures us that this is a sensational meal, and then comes the moment that seals the deal, that causes us to bond with the strange cooking teacher now and forever: She leans toward the camera and confides, `When you've added all those French touches, who's going to know?'""Karen Karbo describes herself as an average home cook. Who cares, as long as she keeps serving up these tasty, life-affirming five-star books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5IX7H93SCGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762783095#wasThisHelpful","R1U5IX7H93SCGX","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lockerbie.The name of that small town in Scotland should be all you need to recall what happened there.If you need more to jog your memory, try this: Pan Am 103.Yes, that.Just before Christmas of 1988, a half hour into a flight from London to New York, an explosion shredded that plane, killing all 243 passengers, 16 crew members and 11 people in a Scottish village. There were 89 Americans on that plane; until 9/11, it was the deadliest terror attack against the United States.Who did it? In 2001, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi --- from Libya --- was convicted. According to the evidence presented at trial, the bomb was put in a suitcase that was loaded on a plane in Malta. It went to Frankfurt, then London, and then....Who gave that evidence? A man from Malta. Just one man. But it was enough.Jim Swire, an English doctor whose daughter was a passenger on Pan Am 103, didn't buy it. He made a cause out of not buying it. He even went to see Abdelbaset al-Megrahi in jail.Disconcerting, don't you think? Because if al-Megrahi didn't get a bomb-laden suitcase onto the plane, who did? If he didn't do it, how involved were the police in creating the testimony that convicted him? And how many other cases are also ""solved"" in order to protect some ""national interest"" we know nothing about?It's a great set-up for a drama, and Joseph Robertson, a Scottish novelist, jumped all over it in ""The Professor of Truth."" In his story the 28-year-old wife and 6-year-old daughter of Alan Tealing, an English professor at a college in Scotland, died in that plane bombing. Tealing goes numb: ""That was the point: not to think about it. Just to do things, to get through the waking hours and the hours that were supposed to be for sleep, was all."" Eighteen years later, he's still mourning, still numb, still alone.Well, not quite. Khalil Khazar has been convicted of the bombing, largely because of the testimony of one witness. Professor Tealing never bought that narrative. For all these years, he's been working on ""The Case,"" a mass of research that, taken together, makes the government's case against Khazar look bogus.  Other families have found ""closure."" Tealing has found a cause.One snowy afternoon Tealing has a visitor, an American intelligence officer who uses a name that's probably fake. He's ill, dying of cancer. Before he dies, he wants Tealing to have a piece of information that just might help him prove the government convicted the wrong man. And that's all I should say about the plot, lest I spoil the fraught pleasure of reading the novel.I make it sound as if ""The Professor of Truth"" is a nail-biter. That's not quite accurate. Everything about the bombing is thrilling and heartbreaking --- especially the set pieces about the week after the crash, which put you inside Tealing's horror and grief. But this is also a meditation on the tension between justice and truth. By the second half of the book, when Tealing drops everything to seek the truth, morality and action get very tangled. And then you get passages like: ""This cause goes beyond all of us. It even goes beyond Emily and Alice and the other people on that flight. Beyond us all there is something else worth reaching for, greater than any of us.""I'm an impatient person. Sometimes, when we go to a busy restaurant and our waiter is clearly overtaxed, I'll ask for the check when we order --- why lose precious minutes of your life waving in vain for your waiter's attention at the end of the meal? ""The Professor of Truth"" reminded me how impatient I am. Conversations end, and then they keep going. We get a guided tour of thoughts that are in a kind of spin cycle.I know just enough of grief to get that Robertson's descriptions are psychologically acute.  But I'm more interested in the story, and although I woke up at 3 AM to finish the book, I found myself skimming.At the end, I thought what I so often do: At 317 pages, this almost terrific book is 40 pages too long. How I wish someone had hired me to do some modest surgery. The novel would have cut like butter, and this four-star novel would have been a red hot, politically sharp five-star thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32FRN11PV1KPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159051632X#wasThisHelpful","R32FRN11PV1KPU","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started listening to the title song of ""Tall Tall Shadow,"" Basia Bulat's new CD, and I heard a kind of bruised purity. The walking rhythm was clever. The production was crisp. But there are a gazillion female singer-songwriters with straight blonde hair and sweet voices, and few are likely to break out of the pack.I was at the 1:40 mark, about to eject the CD, when the song shifted gears. Bruised purity became passion --- the song became instantly personal. The voice I'd thought perhaps too pretty turned urgent: ""You're running away/but the shadow is your own."" And then I had to listen to all ten of the songs on ""Tall Tall Shadow.""Who is Basia Bulat? She's Canadian. (She's met Leonard Cohen.) This is her third CD. (She has played the auto-harp in public.) Largely unknown here, she has a cult in Canada. (All those fans have health care.) Nice. Too nice.What makes ""Tall Tall Shadow"" compelling?""Two months before I was due to begin recording, I suffered a deep loss. I kind of started over.""""Kind of?"" Translation: totally.I found a video of her singing at a Toronto art gallery. It's a buzzy crowd, delighted with itself. Given a choice between chatting and a singer, they'll take both --- and talk over the singer. Bulat's a trooper. She plays guitar for a minute, and then she starts singing a song called ""It Can't Be You,"" and then the room quiets. There are some trills available to her that elude most singers, and two minutes in, she rolls them out. And from there to the end of the song, she owns that audience.We spoke on the phone. Looking over the transcript, one exchange jumps out at me.Jesse: If you had a nickel for everyone who said ""You're a female singer from Canada. Joni Mitchell is from Canada, I guess you went to school on her,"" how rich would you be?Basia: Very. (Pause. Laugh.) And they'd be right!That's when the penny dropped. New generation Joni Mitchell?

"I come to this music as a listener. Until recently, I was clueless how it feels to sing in a choir. Then I read ""Imperfect Harmony: Finding Happiness Singing with Others."" The author is Stacy Horn, who I remember from the early days of the Internet as the founder of Echo, a New York chat salon a decade ahead of its time. That's a cool achievement, but it doesn't really describe her. As she coolly assesses her life, ""Boyfriends come and go, jobs come and go, cats live and die, a stay in rehab when I was thirty, broken engagements and the deaths of those I love."" The one constant? Singing. For 30 years, she's been a member of the Choral Society of Grace Church.""Imperfect Harmony"" is the record of her experience, and because she's Stacy Horn, an inveterate researcher, you get a lot in 264 pages. Romances, mostly failed, and the hope of finding a new one when new people join the choir. Rehearsals, so well described you feel as if you're in the room. Reader-friendly accounts of some of the pieces the choir sings. Sharp anecdotes: In a concentration camp, a choir of Jews sang the Verdi Requiem, even though they had to replace their members four times in a single year. It's a dazzling book, never hitting a false note and, quite possibly, inspiring you to think about joining a choir.Should you be motivated to raise your voice with others, know that's not a minority impulse. As Horn writes, ""32.5 million adults sing in choirs, up by almost 10 million over the past six years. Many people think of church music when you bring up group singing, but there are over 270,000 choruses across the country."" That includes the show choir your kid is in. And, of course, ""Glee.""Most of those singers would not make it past the first round on a reality show. That, says Horn, is not the point. Music creates relationships. It affects your brain chemistry --- it's ""the perfect drug."" And it provides great comfort: ""I'm one day poorer and another day singler and we're all going to die, but together with all these people I have raised my voice.""""I am not a great singer,"" she tells us, but listen to how the book ends: ""We sang that section over and over, reveling in the warm glow of our voices and the magic current of potential that comes to life whenever people are drawn together by the astonishing and irresistible power of a song.""I closed the book and felt at peace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QLQCQD3M831/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616200413#wasThisHelpful","R4QLQCQD3M831","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For our final New Year's Eve party in our old apartment, we invited a great many people --- people we knew and loved, people we kinda knew and might love if we knew them better, people we superficially knew and wanted to meet. Garland Jeffreys was in category three. Imagine our surprise when he and his wife Claire showed up. A wavelet of recognition in the room, followed by pleasure that they were so ""regular.""Midnight arrived. My wife was elsewhere. Which is how it came to pass that my first kiss of 2013 was with Garland Jeffreys. (Who's a better kisser? I don't kiss and tell.)""Truth Serum"" is the second Garland Jeffreys kiss to land here this year.And this one is even more unexpected. After a 13-year hiatus, Jeffreys released The King of In Between in 2011. It was relevant in every possible way, and it was great music. It had the mix of genres --- Bob Marley called him the only American who could really sing reggae --- that are his trademark. It had a strong, populist point-of-view. And it had what so much music lacks: melodies you hum on the street, rhythms that get you moving.Now, just two years later, comes another CD, ""Truth Serum."" Again, the trademark mix of genres, the strong point-of-view (""I'm secretly longing for brotherhood, harmony, justice, and discouraged by how rarely that happens in the world""), the memorable music.Did I say that Garland Jeffreys is now 70 years old? And that he recorded each of these songs in a single take? He says he's on ""the 90 year plan."" If dancing on the tables at 70, crowd-funding your CD and getting stage time with Bruce Springsteen are evidence, there's reason to think he just might.In the Age of Branding, we have been trained to want our artists to be one-trick ponies. Garland Jeffreys, the last Renaissance Man, spits in the eye of that notion. He's even willing to look back, draw from the past, re-animate the classics.When he was 70, Picasso was worried about his testosterone and Matisse was reaching for his scissors so he could make cut-outs. Garland Jeffreys, at 70, is off on a world tour. And ""Wild in the Streets"" --- recorded in 1973 --- still sounds fresh.

"Amy Winehouse had 14 tattoos. She smoked crack cocaine and took heroin. She was bulimic. As her best known song announced, ""I don't want to go to rehab."" And she didn't. She died in 2011, aged 27.The tragedy and squalor of her life make it hard to remember that Amy Winehouse was the greatest female singer of the decade.Beth Hart has 9 tattoos. She started drinking as a kid; at 13, she spent a day at Alcoholics Anonymous. On the verge of a great career --- she portrayed Janis Joplin in the musical ""Love, Janis"" --- she moved on to drugs. She didn't want to go to rehab. She wanted to die. She had a seizure. Her husband lay on top of her, crying. Only then did something shift for her: ""I realized, `This is an amazing person that I have in my life and he loves me. That means there must be something good inside of me.'""The next day, she went into rehab.Beth Hart has been sober for a decade now. So when I say that she is the next Amy Winehouse, I mean it in the best possible way: She has a talent with no ceiling. None. I wish I could see her tonight. I will make do --- early and often --- with her astonishing, thrilling, satisfying-on-many-levels CD, ""Bang Bang Boom Boom.""A large claim. But let me tell you a story: Beth doing the Etta James classic, ""I'd Rather Go Blind,"" at the Kennedy Center honors. Jeff Beck, the great guitarist, had seen Beth sing a few months earlier. She was huge in Europe, small here --- her ancient history scared record companies away. No matter, he invited her to sing before the President and Mrs. Obama, a distinguished audience and, on television, the world. Her mission: honor Buddy Guy.Beth comes onstage. Her name means nothing; only insiders know her. ""I looked up, saw Buddy up there and just tried to sing it to him."" In the video, she sings one line. Then the director cuts to Buddy Guy's face. And stays on it. Because it's always a moment to savor when a legend gets blown away.In past CDs, Beth Hart has channeled Joplin, Aretha, Etta, Billie Holiday, Otis Redding. On this one, in her notes, she also acknowledges ""the great Amy Winehouse."" Not doomed Amy, but the Amy who, in her music, hoped love would redeem her. And so, on ""Bang Bang,"" her songs sometimes even touch on... happiness. But really, the words don't matter much. The performance is.Innovation? Not her thing. Passion is. Rage. Abject, on her knees, devotion. Think: If Janis Joplin could sing on key....The songs have a big range. You'll hear echoes of Billie, Janis, Etta, Fiona Apple. But what you'll hear in pretty much every song is drama. Don't be fooled by a soft, thoughtful opening --- this woman will soon be spitting and foaming. Take another piece of your heart? That's all she does.This is your aerobics music. Your party music. Your dance in the dark when you're loaded moment. Your blues. Your necessary music.""I want to know love before I die,"" she sings. ""Open the window.""She sure has.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2YCQTXA1GUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9LND2Q#wasThisHelpful","R2R2YCQTXA1GUW","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took a walk in the park and there did meet a friend I think of as the sister I never had. She was walking with a friend, Kate Manning. Writer, meet writer. With a difference: Kate's book was about to be published.Would I read it?If only as a favor to the sister I never had, of course.""My Notorious Life: A Novel"" arrived. It was everything I do not want. 434 pages. Set in the 19th century. Told in the first person, in 19th century speech. Based, in part, on the life of Ann Trow Lohman (1811-79) also known as Madame Restell, who practiced midwifery in New York for almost forty years.In sum: a book not likely to hook me, a reader who likes short books about people I might know or want to. But the friend of a friend is my potential friend --- or, at least, someone I can't shun. I started to read:""It was me who found her. April 1, 1880. The date is engraved on my story same as it is on the headstone, so cold and solid there under the pines. What happened that morning hurts me to this day, enrages me still, though many years have passed.""The time was just before dawn. She was there in the tub. It had claw feet, gold faucets. Marble was everywhere in that room, so magnificent. A French carpet. A pair of velvet settees, a dressing table, candelabra, powders and pomades, all deluxe. I knew something was wrong right away. When I knocked I knew. There was not no noise of bathing, just that slow drip. That plink of water landing on water, so dreadful. I went in and there she was. A scarf of red across her shoulders, down her chest. The water was red and cold with all her life leaked out. A bloodbath. My hands were trembling. Terrible sounds strangled in my throat, quiet so as not to wake the house. My little daughter and my husband were fast asleep. The maid was not yet up.""Well done. But... sigh... 19th century prose. Wait: there's a story, and it's quite a tale. Axie Muldoon --- her real name is Annie, but her mother calls her Axie ""because I was forever axing so many questions"" --- is the child of a poor, one-armed woman, trapped in New York's filthy, airless slums. Her mother dies in childbirth, her brute of a stepfather could care less about her, and Annie and her siblings are shipped off to foster families in the Midwest.  Years later, 14-year-old Axie returns to New York, where she's apprenticed to a midwife and taught the art of birthing. But although Mrs. Evans is said to be able to ""fix a girl up,"" Axie doesn't see her do any abortions.To my surprise, I was on page 110.Axie has a suitor, Charles Jones. He's as poor as she is, and ambitious, mostly, it seems, to have his way with her. ""One evening, when the night was thick with the smell of warmed garbage and the heat was trapped down amongst the buildings"" --- there's a romantic setting for you --- he shows up, bearing wine, ""a hard swooning taste new to my tongue."" He's about to be drafted. He begs. And she succumbs.A sex scene from 1860? Yes. And I succumbed too.Women come, all pregnant, all in trouble. At first Axie is disgusted by the work, but she never gets tired ""of the drama and the miracle."" When Mrs. Evans dies, Axie takes over. Charlie becomes her husband and partner. She is unsure of love, but she trusts money --- it ""did not go off elsewhere in the night drinking hops and gin and coming home to fondle a woman and call her names only to pass out."" Tart, she is. Cheeky. And a compelling storyteller.Define ""compelling?"" Try this: Dickensian. That is, a novel stuffed with vivid characters, lively speech, no dross, a plot that's not ashamed of melodrama, and, not least, a great injustice.My wife likes to say that the world's biggest drug problem is testosterone, and that is never truer than when the subject is women and their reproductive freedom. In the late 19th century, men imposed codes that made sure this freedom didn't exist, so Axie Muldoon works in the shadows, using euphemism as her first language. Then a villain appears, taken from real life: Anthony Comstock (1844-1915). In the Army, ""he refused to drink his ration of whiskey and delighted in pouring it on the ground in front of his comrades in arms."" Later, he turned his attention to ""vice."" Axie finds him a ""hideous"" man. And knows that ""we two, me and Comstock, was barreling toward each other, each one on a mission.""You can, if you like, read ""A Notorious Life"" as commentary on America's never-ending battle over women's rights. Certainly, Comstock lives on, and not just on Sunday morning political shows and the sidewalks in front of family planning centers. And it will ever be thus, for some American men want to control women's lives even more than they want to put a gun in the hand of every citizen.I didn't read the book as metaphor --- not because I'm a man, but because ""My Notorious Life"" really is a Dickensian reading experience. It violates all my little rules for novels. But Axie Muldoon is a heroine and a half, and I cheered her on every page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ANV7UHVBGJTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451698062#wasThisHelpful","R2ANV7UHVBGJTS","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The movie was a block away, we were already at ABC Carpet, we had an hour --- why not have a quick dinner at ABC Kitchen?For so-called sophisticates, we were rubes. We knew that Jean-Georges Vongerichten had hit New York as a prodigy: head chef of Lafayette at 29. That his restaurant, Jean George, was one of five restaurants in New York to have been awarded three stars by Michelin. And that, as Sam Sifton wrote in The Times, his empire was growing so fast he had opened ""roughly 6,000 restaurants... on Earth and other planets in the last year.""ABC Kitchen, we imagined, was a casual restaurant. Well, for all its apparent informality, it's quite serious about its mission: ""regionally-grown, organically focused cuisine that is rooted in cultivating a safe relationship with the environment and our table. ""Or as Sam Sifton translated: ""ABC Kitchen represents fantasy, wealth without guilt, socially responsible hedonism. Resistance is futile. Obey.""As we took seats at the bar --- our new discovery: sit at the bar --- we had no idea that a casual restaurant could be this good. Just reading the menu was a thrill. With difficulty (and with guidance from a bartender who had come to work at ABC Kitchen because he'd been spending a fortune here as a diner), we chose sweet corn with cotijac cheese and lime ($11), grilled maitake mushrooms with goat cheese and Fresno pepper vinaigrette ($12) household ricotta ravioli with herbs and tomato sauce ($15 for four, $23 for six) and roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, souu cream and citrus ($16).One of the all-time great meals? Yes, but that's a clich. Better to offer specific praise: Although we chose small plates, we were completely satisfied --- indeed, we would have dishonored the meal if we'd munched  popcorn at the multiplex.That night, we learned that Jean-Georges writes cookbooks --- most recently, ""Home Cooking with Jean-Georges: My Favorite Simple Recipes."" The introduction is a revelation: three decades of l6-hour days, 6 days a week in restaurants. At 50, he buys a country house with a big kitchen and makes a monumental decision: He'll take two days off each week. Naturally, on weekends, he cooks with and for his family.It is crucial that you understand that this master's idea of ""home cooking"" is not yours. Yes, there are simple, easy dishes you can knock off in a few minutes. But as a general rule: what is simple for Jean-Georges is a dish you'd cook for company --- many of these recipes require more ingredients and more time than the title suggests.Worth it? The names will help you decide. Pea soup with carrots, chiles and mint. A mac and cheese --- quite simple, really --- with five cheeses. Pistachio pesto. Parmesan-crusted chicken --- amazingly easy. Pork chops with cherry mustard. Pan-roasted green beans with golden almonds. Cumin and citrus roasted carrots. Bittersweet chocolate Chantilly.Can you resist? I couldn't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXVO8LPAQQM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030771795X#wasThisHelpful","R1EXVO8LPAQQM1","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In poem after poem, Heaney's words seem... inevitable. He had the Irish gift --- the gift of glib --- but he didn't use words for self-glorification. As someone said, he saw the Nobel Prize (among friends, he spoke of ""the N-word"") as encouragement to do better.Heaney was that rare event: a great writer, a great man. He taught. He mentored. He praised. He parented. And still did the internal work that led to a book of selected poems that topped 400 pages. ""Seamus never had a sour moment, neither in person nor on paper,"" said the playwright Tom Stoppard. ""You couldn't help loving him any more than you could help reading on from the first line.""The life, in brief: Born in Northern Ireland, in 1939, the eldest of nine children. (A younger brother, age four, was killed by a car. His poem about the death ends: ""Wearing a poppy bruise on the left temple/ He lay in the four foot box as in a cot./ No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear./ A four foot box, a foot for every year."") He won a scholarship to a school that nourished him, earned a college degree in English, taught, married, wrote. In college, he said of his writing, ""I was just kicking the ball around the penalty area, not trying to shoot at the goal. Then in 1962 the current began to flow.""The Heaney poems you may have seen quoted mostly describe a world as foreign to us as the moon, a rural world of lorries, peat, wells, animals and the heavy tread of the Church. As he describes it in his Nobel Prize speech:""...in rural Co. Derry, we crowded together in the three rooms of a traditional thatched farmstead and lived a kind of den-life which was more or less emotionally and intellectually proofed against the outside world. It was an intimate, physical, creaturely existence in which the night sounds of the horse in the stable beyond one bedroom wall mingled with the sounds of adult conversation from the kitchen beyond the other. We took in everything that was going on...""But don't make the mistake of thinking Heaney is as accessible as Robert Frost. Many poems, especially the later ones, read like stories or letters, but for the earlier ones, it would help if you have a command of myth and poetry. The through line: language. His delight in being at college is ""exhilarated self-regard."" About writing: ""Cultivate a work-lust/ that imagines its haven like your hands at night/ dreaming the sun in the sunspot of a breast."" A poem, he write, is ""a ploughshare that turns time/ Up and over"" --- like cutting peat. Because there's always a connection between where he's from and where he is now. As in ""Digging,"" one of his most frequently quoted poems:Between my finger and my thumbThe squat pen rests; snug as a gun.Under my window, a clean rasping soundWhen the spade sinks into gravelly ground:My father, digging. I look downTill his straining rump among the flowerbedsBends low, comes up twenty years awayStooping in rhythm through potato drillsWhere he was digging.The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaftAgainst the inside knee was levered firmly.He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deepTo scatter new potatoes that we picked,Loving their cool hardness in our hands.By God, the old man could handle a spade.Just like his old man.My grandfather cut more turf in a dayThan any other man on Toner's bog.Once I carried him milk in a bottleCorked sloppily with paper. He straightened upTo drink it, then fell to right awayNicking and slicing neatly, heaving sodsOver his shoulder, going down and downFor the good turf. Digging.The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slapOf soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edgeThrough living roots awaken in my head.But I've no spade to follow men like them.Between my finger and my thumbThe squat pen rests.I'll dig with it.""If you have the words,"" he said, ""there's always a chance that you'll find the way.""Did he ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBZP2V5BGMH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374526788#wasThisHelpful","R1BBZP2V5BGMH4","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hollywood would rather make ""Rocky 2"" than ""Rocky.""Publishers would rather release ""Gone Girl 2"" than just about anything.You can't blame them. In 2012 Gone Girl was the Fifty Shades of thrillers, with two million copies sold. (A year after publication, the publisher is in no rush to produce the paperback; think September.) Now the movie is on the way, starring Ben Affleck and --- take your pick --- Natalie Portman, Jessica Chastain or Emily Blunt. Ka-ching!So you can't blame the publishers of ""The Silent Wife"" for hyping it as ""the new `Gone Girl.'""It's not. It just might be better.I say this because ""Gone Girl"" is not nearly as good as its fans think it is. I liked it when I wrote about it, then realized it was built backward --- there was a trick ending the author thought of before she wrote the book. But there was a problem, and I didn't see it the first time through: To get to that ending, she needs her character to do something not just beyond probability but beyond credulity. In essence, the last third of the book is a fraud.""The Silent Wife,"" by A.S.A. Harrison, is, like ""Gone Girl,"" the story of a marriage told from alternating ""his"" and ""her"" perspectives. It lacks ""Gone Girl's"" physical thrills. But unlike ""Gone Girl,"" it has the virtue of meticulous characterization and reality-based plot.Jodi and Todd are in their 40s. In their two decades of marriage, they've built what someone (not me, but someone) would call ""a nice life."" Their apartment is on the 47th floor of a condominium that overlooks Lake Michigan in Chicago. He is a successful property developer. She is a psychotherapist who has the luxury of choosing her clients.Are they happy? No. They pretend to be, but really, they co-exist. Are they nice? Not especially. Todd sleeps around; Jodi knows it but never confronts him. For an educated woman, Jodi has a annoyingly small life: cooking, the gym, a few patients, some dull friends, having Todd's cocktail ready when he gets home.I'm told that many people live this way, that this is a familiar situation to many readers. It's not familiar to me; in fact, it's exactly the kind of life that would make me nuts. Sample this:""Trimming vegetables and chopping herbs, she throws herself bodily into the work. She likes the intensity of cooking--the readiness of the gas flame, the timer marking off the minutes, the immediacy of the result. She's aware of the silence beyond the kitchen, everything rushing to the point in time when she'll hear his key in the lock, an event that she anticipates with pleasure. She can still feel that making dinner for Todd is an occasion, can still marvel at the stroke of fate that brought him into her life, a matter of rank chance that did not seem to favor a further acquaintance, much less a future of appetizing meals, lovingly prepared.""I'm not married to a woman like this. No one I know is. Maybe they're all in Chicago.But forget all that and ponder this: How does a mouseburger this cool and stiff decide to kill her husband?Ah, now the book gets interesting. To avoid spoilers, I'll be vague from here, but let's just say that he has a secret and she has a secret and their secrets are on a collision course.Direct confrontation? Then this wouldn't be an intellectual thriller.The many pages of Adlerian psychology? If they weren't here, the book would be less than 300 pages. And that would break some sacred rule of publishing. No matter. You have learned to skip. And you always knew, as the tension mounts, how to gnaw at your nails.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OOED6DP1VMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143123238#wasThisHelpful","R19OOED6DP1VMH","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Judy Resnick and I seem so different --- I'm New York writer to the bone, she's West Coast finance on the surface --- that people often ask how we became friends.""Through Mike Milken,"" I say, knowing that the mere mention of the financier and philanthropist will only lead to more questions.But our friendship is actually simple. While I was researching my Milken book, I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles. Judy had created an interesting niche within Milken's empire. And in her home, she had a room that was ideal for pacing and thinking in the evening. Eventually I'd say something. She'd correct me. And after a while this English major learned enough about finance to have a semi-intelligent conversation.I was also taken by Judy's success story. She didn't begin her career in finance until she was 40, but her ascent was meteoric. Eight years after she started working as a broker, she co-founded her own firm. In 1994, she was named Los Angeles Entrepreneur of the Year in Financial Service. Because she has a special interest in helping women manage their finances, she launched the Resnick Group in 1998. In 1999, she published a book. And now she's updated it. She's donating all profits to a group that provides legal aid to abused and disadvantaged women.Here's how her new book begins....In 1998, I published a book called ""I've Been Rich, I've Been Poor. Rich Is Better."" My intention then was to help men and women --- but mostly women --- understand the importance of having enough money to invest after they've paid their living expenses.I was smart --- I took the advice I gave my readers. I worked hard, saved my money, invested wisely and insured myself well. If I hadn't, I would be in terrifying shape: 70 years old and in huge financial trouble. But still, like most of you, my net worth took a hit in 2008.And, long before 2008, I took some personal hits.Flash back to 1998, soon after I published my book. I sold my business, but I continued to work as a financial advisor --- just at a more human pace. I felt peaceful. Secure. Confident about the future.Then 9/11 happened. Because the World Trade Center was home to many financial services businesses, even those of us who worked in California knew people who died that day. I had a special reaction --- in 1978, my mother and my sister were killed in a plane crash near San Diego. Looking at planes hitting the towers, I relived my family's tragedy. I couldn't function --- I had a hard time with depression and anxiety.An empathic client suggested that I take some time off and see a shrink. I went into therapy, started taking anti-depressants. It took me four years to feel like myself again. Luckily, I had disability insurance that supported me the entire time I was unable to work.My younger daughter --- married, with three school-aged children --- has long had a debilitating, incapacitating disease. One night, while she was in the hospital, her husband walked out the door and into another woman's apartment. What he left behind, in addition to his family: a car that was ready to be repossessed and a house on which he owed three months rent. Unsurprisingly, he lost his job and hasn't worked again.What would you do? Exactly: I helped my daughter find great doctors and moved her and her brood --- the kids, the dogs and the cat --- in with me. Just to make it a real zoo, I added some chickens. I am the financial rock that holds these lives together.Because I don't want to burn through savings and my retirement fund, I work. It's good for my head. It's better for the cash flow. But what if I didn't have savings? What if I didn't have a way to earn a living? If I hadn't been insured properly, what would have happened?My daughter's experience has seared me --- and changed me. In the '90s, I focused on helping women, but I was happy to invest for men as well. That's still true, but now I'm obsessed with helping women in transition.""Women in transition"" means women who are undergoing a major life change. Widowhood. Divorce. Unemployment. A career reassessment. Anything that says: ""From now on, you must live differently. Now you must rely on yourself.""Some of these women are rich --- but I assure you, they don't feel it. Suddenly they're only half as rich as they used to be. Or they're sitting on a fixed amount of money. They do the math --- or I do it for them --- and see that their old way of life is unsustainable.But rich or less than rich, the law of economics is the same: We all have to learn to live within our means. And we have to take responsibility for our own financial security.This means that if you're married, you must educate yourself financially, even if your partner is making money for both of you. If you're living with someone, you must do the same. And if you're earning your own money, you still have to educate yourself, because your paycheck only supports you today --- it's what you save and invest that supports you tomorrow. Ignoring the issues doesn't work, not if you want to end up self-sufficient and secure; not if you want to avoid pushing a shopping cart down the block.In these pages, in addition to financial advice, I share my story: how my father spoiled me, how I married a jerk, divorced him, was left with two kids and no clue what to do for a career, how I was stunned when my father died and we learned the real state of his finances, and then how I found a job as a broker and worked like crazy to make up for two lost decades.I am living proof that life on your own can be hard, but that it can be very satisfying to confront your challenges and forge new successes. Yes, it's painful when reality forces you to be constantly realistic. And managing my own expectations is hard sometimes --- I didn't expect to be raising kids at this age, nor did I dream I'd be working this hard. But watching the kids flourish in their new life is a satisfaction without price.I want every woman to have what I do --- pride and purpose. And, though it doesn't sound as important as pride and purpose, a budget and self-discipline. Hard to achieve? Not once you have someone cheering you on. Not once you understand a handful of basic principles.You don't have to become my client to master the principles that will help you get more control of your money and your life. Just keep reading....","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7M6AJ2G5F87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1479739499#wasThisHelpful","R3A7M6AJ2G5F87","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year, when I began to rave about a film called 'Troubled Water,' a friend said he wasn't likely to watch it.""You have a greater capacity for sadness than I do,"" he told me.Later, I thought: not just a greater capacity, a greater appetite.And I decided: In 2013, less sadness. Starting with fewer pieces about gloom-drenched books and movies.""The Rules of Inheritance"" is a memoir about a bummer. Two bummers, really. When Claire Bidwell Smith, an only child, was 14, both of her parents were diagnosed with cancer. When she was 18, her mother died. When she was 25, her father died.Why, you may wonder, am I writing about this book?Initially, my reason was personal.When my wife was 11, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. When she was 13, her mother died. When she was 17, her father died.Claire Bidwell Smith is now a grief counselor and hospice worker --- she's not only come to terms with her losses, she's learned how to use them to help others. My wife has taken paths to healing that do not include the writing of a memoir. And in this, my third marriage, I am not so stupid that I believe asking my wife direct questions about the biggest tragedies in her life is endearing or useful. But here was a book. And I thought... okay, just this once....""The Rules of Inheritance"" is sensationally good, and if you have lost someone you love or are in the process of losing someone, I'd put this book on top of the pile.But that's not the reason I want to write about it. As I was reading Smith's memoir, I happened upon a blog by Dani Shapiro, author of Devotion. She writes:""Lately, I've been reading a lot of books that play it safe. Conventional narratives, characters whose edges are smoothed out to a palatable degree. Can I just say it? These books bore me. I'm bored. It's like eating muesli when I want a charred, juicy steak. I want to read about messiness. I don't need the pieces to fit together in fiction -- I mean, when do the pieces ever fit together in life? I want to encounter characters who feel, who do the unexpected. Who think human thoughts -- no matter how dark and flawed and uncomfortable. I want to be reminded of my own inner landscape, my own complex humanity.""I also seem to be getting a lot of those books. Description? For pages. Plots? So exquisitely graphed that they're airless. And long? My pet peeve. So very, very long.For these ""term-paper"" writers --- because they write as if a kindly teacher is going to give them an ""A"" and send a nice note home --- and their suicidal publishers, it might as well be 1910. Did the Internet happen? Did reading habits and attention spans change? ""Yes, of course."" And the implications of that? ""We'll adjust our marketing.""The most important question --- might readers be more inclined to read shorter, more crisply edited books? --- goes unanswered, largely because it seems not to be asked. And that is one of the reasons I have such high hopes for the novel I'm writing. ""The Great Gatsby"" is a thin book: 47,094 words. Mine won't top 47,000. And it's written in the style I've developed in 15 years of writing on the Internet: short sentences, short paragraphs, more dialogue than description. ""Prose like a windowpane,"" Orwell said. Well, I'm trying.And so is Claire Bidwell Smith. Her book is a chronicle of a decade-long nervous breakdown. In her case, that means a doomed relationship with an obsessive lover, aimless travel, a joke of an assistant's job for the West Coast editor of a magazine that sounds suspiciously like Vanity Fair and a bout of nursing her father. And it means the thoughts she has along the way.""Champagne for my sham friends, real pain for my real friends,"" Noel Coward said. Smith writes for herself --- she hardly dares to imagine that she has friends --- in an effort to become a friend to herself. So her thoughts are brutal.Claire, your mother is dying. Nothing. I feel nothing.My mother is dead. She has been dead for three days. My mother has been dead for three days. I say it out loud over and over...My mother is gone. My father is 78 years old. This is it. I am on my own.I would do anything to have my mother back.Like that, for 260 pages. A collection of anecdotes, with glimmers of possibility along the way. And a final chapter that is everything you hope it will be --- for her, for you, for us all.Could Smith have filled 400 pages? Why not? All the others do. But Smith matched method to story. She gave us a book that's reads right for right now. And sounds as if it will be true forever.A sample. She's 18. It's her last night in Spain. She meets a boy, a smart, sweet boy. And goes home with him:Moments can be so simple sometimes. In this one I realize that I have convinced myself that nothing could ever hurt as much as my mother's death but in fact, the opposite is true.Everything hurts.Tears well up in my eyes. It occurs to me that I have been pretending, that I thought I deserved this. For the first time, I feel the knife slide in just a little.I turn my head to one side to hide my tears and I feel Alvaro's heavy silence.I've never done this, he whispers.I turn back to him, searching his face.A few days ago his girlfriend of two years - his first love - left him. His voice is a whisper as he tells me this. She already has a new boyfriend.I knew, Alvaro says, the moment my fingers closed around your camera, that I would sleep with you.My mother is dead, I say in response. She died a couple of months ago.I knew I would sleep with you too, I say.We spend the rest of the night talking, face to face, our legs crossed Indian-style on the bed, and then perched on stools at the kitchen counter drinking cold juice, and later back in his car, the stars are high and clear above us.It doesn't occur to me until later how much this night is like the one I spent with Michel, but when it does, I will again marvel at the power people have to unlock each other.I call that an ""A."" And perhaps this note to the author will suffice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZ3EY2R5M3UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452298873#wasThisHelpful","RFZ3EY2R5M3UZ","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been called ""one of the best albums never heard outside San Francisco.""I'd bet my hands that the only readers who know about this CD are 1) senior citizens who were fanatic rock fans in the `60s or 2) fans of the singer's later CDs who have been directed to it or 3) acolytes of Duane Allman.Don't feel bad if you're not in one of those cults. The record company hasn't even created an MP3 version of this record --- and it was recorded in 1969.Classic? Would I be playing it right now if it weren't?The Boz Scaggs story in a paragraph: At a private school in Dallas, 12-year-old William Royce Scaggs met 12-year-old Steve Miller. They both played guitar, both loved the blues. A band followed, then college, travel, solo efforts. They hooked up again in San Francisco for the first incarnation of the Steve Miller Band.Steve Miller? Him you know. He was the ""Gangster of Love."" He recorded ""Fly Like An Eagle,"" ""Rock'n Me,"" ""Take the Money and Run,"" ""Jet Airliner"" and ""The Joker."" But before he had hit after hit, he was a pure San Franciscan, playing psychedelic rock. With a difference from many others: the Steve Miller Band played in tune.Boz Scaggs played with Miller for his first two, beautiful-then, beautiful-now albums. Then he headed off on his own. ""Boz Scaggs"" was his first solo CD. It's like nothing else he recorded, and if you know his hits --- ""What Can I Say,"" ""Lido Shuffle;"" ""It's Over"" and ""Lowdown"" -- please imagine they were made by a different, smoother, pop singer.But if you're the curious sort or have an appreciation for the rare, it's ""Boz Scaggs"" you want. The record was co-produced by Jann Wenner, founder of Rolling Stone magazine. Scaggs was backed by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, the legendary all-white group that supported Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett along with such palefaces as the Rolling Stones and Elton John. And on one 12-minute song, the guitarist is Duane Allman.Ever bought a CD for one song? Do it again. The song here is ""Somebody Loan Me a Dime,"" and it is pure sadness. A mournful organ. A piano run. Funeral drums. And then Boz, on his knees: ""Somebody loan me a dime/ I need to call my old time used to be.... Somebody loan me a dime/ You know I need a helpin' hand.""At 4:28 comes a scream. It's Duane Allman's guitar. He returns at 7:45 for a solo. It lasts more than four minutes. Along the way, the piano joins him, the organ swirls, horns play tight little flares and the drummer kicks harder --- the band struts in a thrilling mix of Southern blues and rock and roll.There are guitar aficionados who say that Allman ranks just a bit above Clapton in the pantheon --- well, here's one justification for that heretical view. Prepare to get excited:Nothing compares to that. But the rest of the CD is challenging and original. It's blues and country and even a big of old-time yodeling. I can understand why poor sales were not the only reason Scaggs reinvented himself as a pop crooner --- with this CD, he nailed every genre he cared out. Time to move on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JY9ABYVU6T6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002I9D#wasThisHelpful","R25JY9ABYVU6T6","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 200 words, complete this thought: ""If Martin Luther King Jr. came back to life and saw the United States today, he'd .....""My response would be along these lines: ""... be assassinated within a year.""But we have a black President! Yes, we do. We also have a gun lobby determined to make gun manufacturers richer than Goldman bankers. (Last time the killer used a 30.06 Remington Gamemaster that delivered 2,370 pounds of force on impact, more than enough to kill a rhino. Today, we'd call that a toy.) And we have a self-appointed militia of nutbags who actually believe we're on the verge of a race war and are determined to be on the winning side. King could travel in the Popemobile and it wouldn't matter --- there is no limit to the kind of hate that's been ginned up in this country.But, you may say, King's philosophy lives on.

We have politicians who see it as a badge of honor to amp up their language --- they grin as they talk about pushing our economy over a cliff. TV pundits? Don't start.And then there's Taylor Branch. In 1988, he published ""Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63."" I sat down one weekend and didn't get up until I'd read all 900 pages.Branch went on to complete a trilogy about King. When he was done, the project had taken 24 years and he'd written 2,306 pages.I revere King and I stopped after the first volume.Now? Nobody's going to read 2,306 pages about King. Even if you believe, as Branch does, that ""King's life is the best and most important metaphor for American history in the watershed postwar years,"" you're not about to read 2,306 pages about him.So Branch has smartly produced a new book. Just 190 pages. In essence, it's the Greatest Hits of his trilogy --- he took 18 of the pivotal events in King's years as a civil rights leader and cut-and-pasted a few pages from his previous writing on each. And so you'd have context, he provides short prefaces.He's gone further. This semester, Branch is teaching an honors seminar on the history of the civil rights movement at the University of Baltimore. A limited number of online auditors can join it --- free. The topics: personal stories of characters, from sharecroppers to presidents, who built historical landmarks such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Sit-ins, Mississippi Freedom Summer, the Voting Rights Act, Black Power, Vietnam Protest, contrasting forms of leadership for social and political change, basic issues of race, governmental capacity and violent vs. nonviolent methods.Branch does not write straight history. He's telling an epic story, and he goes high in his language. Here's the conclusion of the assassination chapter:King walked ahead of [Reverend Billy] Kyles to look over the handrail outside, down on a bustling scene in the parking lot [of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee]. Police undercover agent Marrell McCullough (a mole in the entourage) parked almost directly below, returning with SCLC staff members James Orange and James Bevel from a shopping trip to buy overalls. Orange unfolded his massive frame from McCullough's little blue Volkswagen, tussling with Bevel, and Andrew Young stepped up to rescue Bevel by shadow-boxing at a distance. King called down benignly from the floor above for Orange to be careful with preachers half his size.McCullough and Orange walked back to talk with two female college students who pulled in just behind them. Jesse Jackson emerged from the rehearsal room, which reminded King to extend his rapprochement.""Jesse, I want you to come to dinner with me,"" he said. Kyles, overhearing on his way down the balcony stairs, told King not to worry because Jackson already had secured his own invitation.Abernathy shouted from Room 306 for King to make sure Jackson did not try to bring his whole Breadbasket band, while Chauncey Eskridge was telling Jackson he should upgrade from turtleneck to necktie for dinner.Jackson called up to King: ""Doc, you remember Ben Branch?"" He said Breadbasket's lead saxophonist and song leader was a native of Memphis.""Oh, yes, he's my man,"" said King. ""How are you, Ben?""Branch waved. King recalled his signature number from Chicago. ""Ben, make sure you play Precious Lord, Take My Hand in the meeting tonight,"" he called down. ""Play it real pretty.""""O.K., Doc, I will.""Solomon Jones, the volunteer chauffeur, called up to bring coats for a chilly night.There was no reply. Time on the balcony had turned lethal, which left hanging the last words fixed on a gospel song of refuge. King stood still for once, and his sojourn on earth went blank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P5OZK267TBFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451678975#wasThisHelpful","R3P5OZK267TBFG","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A recent film, ""A Late Quartet,"" is about a chamber music group forced to confront the cellist's illness. The movie is a kind of classical music soap opera, and there's a subplot I could have done without, but most of the writing is crisp and the acting is sensational. I was especially taken by a scene in which Philip Seymour Hoffman apologizes to his wife, Catherine Keener, for a stupid night of infidelity.Hoffman: I love you more than anything in the world. I made a stupid mistake.Keener's response is inconclusive.Hoffman: Do you really love me? Or I am just...  convenient?Keener: What do you want?  What is it you want me to tell you?That exchange broke me because the language and the emotion merged --- in that desperate moment, you don't have Shakespearean eloquence, just raw hurt.Those emotions are written in blood in the 49 poems in ""Stag's Leap,"" the new book by Sharon Olds. If you've read her, you know that politics and poetics are not her topic. She is. And this time, she has an epic event to write about.When she was 55 and had been married for 32 years, her husband announced that he had fallen in love with another woman and was leaving her. That was devastating for Olds --- she had often written about her marriage, and for those who read her poems as a diary, it was passionate and profound. Now, reflexively, she began to write again. She made one promise, and it was to her two adult children: I won't publish anything for a decade.Fifteen years later, she published ""Stag's Leap. "" The reference is to her husband's favorite wine. Equally, that stag jumping off a cliff was a metaphor for her husband's exit: ""When anyone escapes, my heart/ leaps up. Even when it's I who am escaped from/ I am half on the side of the leaver.""Those lines set a tone. She's not sticking pins in her husband's back and muttering voodoo - she is coming to terms, she is working to see how they have both gone wrong, how she has been a partner in this. Even in ""The Last Hour,"" when you expect self-control to be lost:Suddenly, the last hourbefore he took me to the airport, he stood up,bumping the table, and took a steptoward me, and like a figure in an earlyscience fiction movie he leanedforward and down, and opened an arm,knocking my breast, and he tried to take somehold of me, I stood and we stumbled,and then we stood, around our core, hishoarse cry of awe, at the center, at the end, of our life.Sharon Olds won the 2012 T.S. Eliot prize for these poems. The vote was unanimous. As Britain's Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, chair of the judging panel, said: ""This was the book of her career. There is a grace and chivalry in her grief that marks her out as being a world-class poet. I always say that poetry is the music of being human, and in this book she is really singing. Her journey from grief to healing is so beautifully executed."" [To buy the paperback of ""Stag's Leap"" from Amazon, click here. For the Kindle edition, click here.]Olds is eloquent about what she learned in the writing of these poems: ""We'd had a lot of good years; then our lives slowly changed, our characters changed, and we were not so well suited to each other anymore. He just realized it long before me. As I began to be able to see some of what happened (not all) from his point of view ---- his wish to be with someone more like himself, someone not a writer ---- then I didn't feel like a victim but more like an equal.""As one of the poems in ""Stag's Leap"" says: ""50/50 we made the marriage/ 50/50 its demise.""Or, as she writes in the final lines of the last poem: ""I did not leave him, he did not leave me, I freed him, he freed me.""Long ago, Sharon Olds said, ""I want a poem to be useful."" For anyone in a failing or failed relationship, these poems are nothing less than a lifesaver, a revelation, a cleanser --- a short cut to a clearer future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSXHR55OM2C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375712259#wasThisHelpful","R1WSXHR55OM2C1","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first night she sang at Harlem's Apollo Theater, she was Willie Mae Thornton, and she was the opening act. The following night, as ""Big Mama"" Thornton, she was the headliner.That overnight success came in 1952, when Willie Mae was 26. By then, she had moved far beyond the gospel songs she learned in the churches of Montgomery, Alabama, where her father was a minister and her mother sang in the choir. Now she was living in Houston, performing in clubs, learning to play drums and harmonica, drinking gin and milk, and being open about her sexuality decades before it was cool to be a lesbian.""My singing comes from my experience...my own experience,"" she said. ""I never had no one teach me nothin'. I never went to school for music or nothin'. I taught myself to sing and to blow harmonica and even to play drums by watchin' other people! I can't read music, but I know what I'm singing! I don't sing like nobody but myself.""Of the 16 songs on the ""Ball & Chain"" CD, recorded when she was in her early 40s, two were huge hits --- for others. One was ""Hound Dog,"" which she first recorded three years before Elvis got to it.And then there is ""Ball N' Chain,"" which Big Mama wrote and owned until Janis Joplin started using it as her show-stopper.But the amazing thing about this CD is that these two classics are matched by almost every other song on it. In part, that's because the musicians playing with her are world-class. On the first few songs, her band features Buddy Guy (guitar), Walter Horton (harmonica) and the great Fred Below (drums). On two cuts, her only accompaniment is Fred McDowell's slide guitar. And for six glorious songs, she's backed by a band that includes Muddy Waters (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica) and the incomparable Otis Spann (piano).Mostly, though, what transports you is Big Mama. Her range astonishes. One moment, she's a crude shouter, loud enough to hush belligerent drunks; the next moment, she's the repository of all the heartache in the world. You'll listen carefully to ""Sweet Little Angel"" because no one's done it better. And you'll want to get up and dance to ""Wade in the Water,"" because she's singing flat-out gospel against a pounding tambourine and a scorching guitar.But on the twentieth hearing, or thereabouts, you will listen to Otis Spann's hushed piano against her forlorn voice in ""Life Goes On"" and feel something like awe.Big Mama never knew real success. She got royalties of $500 for ""Hound Dog,"" her first and only commercial hit. She lived hard. She drank more than was good for her. She died in l984, aged 62, in a Los Angeles rooming house.Naturally, she's much more popular now than she was when she was alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UD6GYKD3ICVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000001FF#wasThisHelpful","R1UD6GYKD3ICVD","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost exactly a year ago --- in the first HeadButler.com edition of 2012 --- I wrote about Blake Mills, a California musician you never heard of. But you would, I said, because ""without any hype, with no great charisma, without even much in the way of stage presence, he is the immediate future of intelligent music.""Some of my readers trusted me and spent an enjoyable year getting to know him and, admit it, feeling superior to the Kool Kids. Some responded to later prods. For most, though, Blake Mills is still as remote as Bashar al-Assad.On Sundays, on the odd chance of reading a glorious obituary, it is my early morning habit to dart the London newspapers. Then I glance at the culture pages, but not with the Anglophilia that afflicted me when I was an English major in college. I'm just... checking.On one of those culture pages, I spotted something interesting, A band called Haim had just been anointed the BBC's ""Sound of 2013"" --- in American sports, this would be the equivalent of being named Rookie of the Year.What was so interesting?The band was three American sisters from California.And they were named Haim.Like Danielle Haim, known to me as girlfriend and drummer of Blake Mills?Had to be. Blake Mills would not have a twit for a collaborator. She would have to be spectacularly talented. No doubt her sisters would be as well.Indeed they are.The band is sometimes described as a latter-day Fleetwood Mac, but Este, Alana and Danielle Haim are so much more than that. For one thing, they're blessedly less self-involved. In fact, they're unscrubbed at every level. They perform in what might be called daywear. Their makeup, if they wear any, is subliminal. They couldn't be more relaxed --- except in their music, which is crisp and inventive. Their voices mesh. Their lyrics bite. Their guitars sting and chime, as needed. Think of them as the children of Fleetwood Mac and Joni Mitchell.They're opening for Mumford & Sons now. Soon they'll be headliners. Then they'll be huge.How did they get so good? When they were pre-schoolers, their father woke from a nap with a vision: a family band. Guitars were acquired. Soon the parent-daughter band had mastered ""Mustang Sally.""The all-kid version was born in 2007, when the youngest daughter was on the verge of graduating high school with no plan to go to college. Lyrics materialized. Recording began. ""For each of the last four years, we made an EP, which we hated,"" they say. ""There are many Haim records that will never be released.""In what they've let out, there's joyous variety. If there's a through line, it's sophisticated rhythms and solo voices that can come from any of the trio. They have a male drummer. To his credit, he can keep up.Their full-length CD will be released later this year. Nice that you can get in on the ground floor now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23670AF5BGMCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GQ26QA#wasThisHelpful","R23670AF5BGMCF","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to see the Rolling Stones --- and they're 70-ish now, so this really could be the last time --- prepare to break the bank.To sit behind the stage at the Brooklyn arena, you'll pay $300. Back of the arena? $650. And if you want to sit right up front, you'll spend $3,500 to $5,000 --- that's for one ticket.Who will pay those prices? Boomers. And, specifically, hedge-fund sharpies, top-tier bond traders and their clients. As Mick Jagger told the crowd at one of those million-dollar gigs the Stones play for corporations that create profits but not jobs, ""Hope you're enjoying this --- because this is your bonuses.""If you love the Rolling Stones and want something new in your collection or if, at this late date, you're curious to know what these guys are really like, I have a cheaper suggestion. It's an enhanced e-book, ""Mick and Keith: Never Stop: My Conversations with the Rolling Stones,"" and it's the handiwork of Rona Elliot.At the dawn of rock, Elliot was an LA kid, ""driving to concerts in my Dad's 1960 Plymouth."" A few years later, she was covering rock music for the ""Today"" Show. She was in the mud at Woodstock, backstage at the Fillmore. She interviewed everyone who mattered.In 1970, she convinced Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to answer a gazillion questions. She met Jagger in New York, at the Waldorf. Three months later, on Antigua, she had her conversation with Keith. They were both relaxed, thoughtful, amused. And more: revealing.What comes across most dramatically in these conversations is that Jagger and Richards share few opinions.Are the Stones a family? No agreement.Were they hurt when they were called ""ugly"" and ""rude?"" Ditto.Did they know ""Satisfaction"" would be a monster hit? Keith (who wrote the killer riff): ""We needed an extra track. I thought it was filler."" Mick: ""Oh yeah. I knew.""Innocence on the road? ""The road is terribly innocent,"" Mick says. ""The girls have such high-pitched voices I'm surprised they let them out without their mothers."" Keith: ""If you're a musician on the road, you don't keep your innocence for more than a few weeks.""Fun. And giggles. But what I really valued is how much seriousness is required to create a Stones show. Keith talks about ""dedication"" and why he isn't quite the goofball he may seem to be: ""The stage is my space, the one place I can get some peace."" And a much larger point: What happens between the band and the audience ""makes you aware of how much people can do when they put their minds to it.""Fifty years on, the Rolling Stones still put their minds to it. (Well, you say, they have many incentives, and their payday is surely not the least.) So does Rona Elliot, who has done more than recycle old interviews; she's compiled rare photos, ticket stubs and personal memorabilia in the service of a smart, joyous celebration of a group that calls itself ""the world's greatest rock band."" They may not be that now, but this e-book makes you want to agree.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRR6GP70ZV6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L40WLS#wasThisHelpful","R2YRR6GP70ZV6Q","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was high on New Orleans when I finished Debra Shriver's book, so I logged on to JetBlue and checked the fare from New York to New Orleans.Would you believe it is as low as $197, one way, tax included?Boy, I wish I did not know that.If you lay your hands on a copy of ""In the Spirit of New Orleans,"" I hope you live far from an airport that has cheap flights to that city, for Debra Shriver's book is so full of positivity they ought to build a shrine to her on Bourbon Street.Part of the attraction of this book and this city is that, as a writer says in these pages, ""This is possibly the least American town in the country."" I know we live in the greatest nation on God's green earth, but have you looked out the window lately? Most of America is a giant strip mall. Not a bit of eye candy as far as the eye can see.New Orleans, in contrast, gives you a glorious past. Okay, somewhat sanitized. Just as New York is an urban theme park, New Orleans gives you Dixieland strut and swagger without the brutality and racism. Its people are stunningly resilient --- there are 300 new restaurants since Katrina. Across race and class, they seem to realize that they are all in show business, and they play their parts admirably. As does Debra Shriver.Ms. Shriver works at the Hearst Tower in New York. (Disclosure: I occasionally write for Hearst.) But she and her husband have restored a house in New Orleans; she has recorded that story in her beguiling first book, ""Stealing Magnolias: Tales from a New Orleans Courtyard."" If I had to lay down money, I'd say that she would much prefer to vote there. A twelth-generation Southerner, she writes with the verve of a native. And the imagination: You'll find a recipe for a wicked seafood gumbo here --- and also one for the city's official cocktail, the Sazerac (bitters, rye whiskey, absinthe, sugar cube --- yikes!).A word on the photography: This photo editor will work again, ditto the designer. Here's a two-page spread of a beautiful restored red-and-white paddle-wheeler. A few pages later, a spread of a giant oak tree, festooned with Spanish Moss. An old black-and-white cityscape has been drenched in red. There's a picture of the domed vault at St. Patrick's Catholic Church that makes you want to rush there and lay on your back. And a close-up of Fats Domino's right hand, the pinky sporting a ring with a rhinestone-encrusted piano. And more. Much more.Debra Shriver's New Orleans is a dreamscape, heaven with a back beat. She doesn't ignore Katrina, but she takes it as much as metaphor as reality. Avoiding a tour of the Lower Ninth Ward --- still largely abandoned, with only a quarter of its pre-Katrina population --- turns out to be good sense. A tourist bus that included that blighted zone on its tour of New Orleans was recently fined $150. Who knew that ""disaster voyeurism"" is a crime?If you've got friend or family with a trip ahead, this is the ideal gift book. But don't, for heaven's sakes, crack it open if travel is not in your immediate future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYSRKW6FRS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1614280592#wasThisHelpful","R3MYSRKW6FRS1","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Mary Alsop (1918-2004) was a society beauty who morphed into a great saloniste and hostess, but the best reason I found to read this 193-page biography is that it chronicles a low-battery marriage, a torrid romance with a married womanizer and, after the deaths of her husband and lover, a second marriage to a gay man she never slept with.In short, ""American Lady: The Life of Susan Mary Alsop"" is a tale of life in the Upper Class before women threw off the shackles.She knew everyone. She had tea with Edith Wharton. Her frequent dinner partner was Winston Churchill (""He has decided I am . . . French . . . and nothing will deter him from speaking French to me.""). The gratin of Paris, Noel Coward, the Duke of Windsor. In Washington, John Kennedy came to her house after the Inaugural parties for a midnight bowl of turtle soup. Lyndon Johnson ""pinched her behind and exclaimed, `Why does such a thin girl wear a garter belt?'""She was, in a word, the best --- and last --- of her breed. And she knew it. ""All these stories will be in the history books,"" she wrote, ""but it does send a chill down one's spine to hear them told by the actors in the drama.""So come for a peek behind the curtain of International Society. But stay for the sex. And then the cost of sex in Susan Mary's world: no shame, but great secrecy. And hypocrisy. And the kind of deprivation caused by the absence of flesh on flash. And, finally, the reckoning.This is surely not the book that Caroline de Margerie, a family friend, believes she has written. As she tells it, this is the story of a prominent young woman --- a descendant of founding father John Jay --- who was born in a time of low vocational and high social expectations for upper crust women. Susan Mary married Bill Patten at 20. He had severe asthma, which limited his activity, but he was gentle and kind - he would be ""a dear and tender friend.""When she was 18, her mother offered her either a debutante ball or a trip abroad. She chose the trip. And did it again in her marriage --- in 1945, she helped her husband get a government job in Paris, and there her life really began.The jolt came from her affair with British diplomat and writer Duff Cooper. He was married to Lady Diana Manners, a high-spirited beauty who knew exactly the kind of man her husband was: a compulsive womanizer. This was not, for her, a problem. ""She asked only to be kept informed.""Susan Mary's husband had no such tolerance, so he was never informed. Or maybe he knew but pretended not to --- in those days, many couples had secret, separate lives. And women like Susan Mary were, in their way, great actresses. ""She walked into adultery as tremulously as a governess into her first job; yet she turned out to be a natural, maneuvering like a seasoned courtesan.""Very seasoned. When she learned she was pregnant, Duff Cooper could not have been less interested. The boy was named William Samuel Patten, Jr. He looked a lot like Duff. Bill never knew. Or pretended not to.Patten died. His close friend Joe Alsop came courting. The world didn't know he was gay --- he was an important Washington journalist, and the revelation would have ended his career --- but he didn't lie to Susan Mary. Why marry him? She needed a father for her children. And she and Joe would make a great team.The Alsops took Washington by storm. Just one problem: In private, Joe could be a total jerk to his wife. And was. Often. This time she didn't take a lover. She just endured. Wrote. Entertained. And found comfort in alcohol.The last years of any life can be problematic. Susan Mary was too well-bred to surrender to bitterness --- in company, she never dropped her game face. But in a stint in a rehab center, at a family meeting, she drops a bomb that shocked me. And will make you rethink much of what you've read.""American Lady: The Life of Susan Mary Alsop"" is a cautionary tale.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173XSA577WIWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025747#wasThisHelpful","R173XSA577WIWL","A1725KPO7A5ULX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1725KPO7A5ULX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These fishnet thigh highs are very nice. The netting is a little bit different than normal fishnets, which are usually made from more of a cotton fiber. This has more stretch to it, almost like the netting is woven from elastic thread. It also has a more delicate netting size that gives a diamond appearance rather than little squares.The top cuff is a pretty lace flourish, about three inches in width. It's a delicate, yet functional touch that adds even more to a simple fishnet. The lace cuff is comfortable on the thigh.There's a seam on the back of the leg that also gives these a retro feeling while still looking modern. You could even wear hosiery underneath these to change the look further.These are a good value and well-made.

"I love this headband but only after I made a small alteration to it. This headband is a nice width but comes with a cincher band that pulls it in to a turban-like configuration. I cut it off because I prefer a smooth band that covers my ears completely. The little cincher prevented full ear coverage and made the band look less elegant than it really is.This is made from a microfiber/jersey that is super soft and extremely stretchy. It clings to the head where you place it without it shifting around or feeling tight.I have the black version, which, turns out, is a true black, not that weird dyed brown/black that passes for black today (cheapens the look).This can be used for a variety of things - outdoor sports like running in the colder weather, as an ear cover in the wind (I'm using it for indoor cold right now) and even for pulling the hair away from the face for a facial or mask.Minus the cincher, this is pretty great.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

I don't think that's supposed to happen.That said, the parts that fit around the foot feel so good that I'm going to give these to my friend who wears a size 6 and get another pair for me these once I figure out what the correct size is.The quality of these socks is high. The fabric/weave is solid with a nice thickness. They're not too thick for a shoe but a slightly larger size would also allow me to wear a thin sock underneath.Overall, an excellent product that is just a bit iffy on the sizes.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"I dont have rosacea but I have dry sections of my skin that wind and cold weather are unkind to. My skin gets red and chapped during the colder months to the point where parts of it hurt badly. I was out in the wind a few days ago and noticed the redness that evening and the next day. I used this product for a few days after and it definitely calmed the redness on my skin. It didnt work overnight but took a few applications to see a difference. Once my skin gets that winter chapped redness, I find it hard to control. Everything hurts on it soap, toner, moisturizer, makeup  exacerbating the redness and it becomes an entire season of irritation and bumps.In the short time Ive been using this, I can feel the difference and Im not dreading the winter as I usually do where my skin is concerned.Its a little expensive at $40 but I can see this one tube lasting the season so that seems pretty reasonable.

"This is a very unusual and original iphone 6 plus case. I have design 16 with a little three-dimensional kitty on the back.

I tried to take some photos in different light to try to capture the effect but I was unsuccessful.The cut outs and openings for the phone buttons are very precise and fit well without obstructing anything.

"Travis Mills, for all intents and purposes, was a normal, American boy, not unlike many of his generation. He excelled in sports, had many friends and a loving family. He also loved his country and joined the U.S. Army where he was a member of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division deployed to the Middle East.During his third deployment, an IED planted by Taliban soldiers injured him so severely, it resulted in a quadruple amputation. His road to recovery is both fascinating and awe-inspiring. I mean, trying to conceive life without arms and legs (even one) is almost impossible to imagine.But true to his determination and will to overcome the challenges facing him, Mills has surmounted obstacles only the strongest among us could even envision (I'm not one of them).While still in the midst of recovery and physical rehabilitation, Mills' genuine personality is clear despite the pain and suffering and struggles he has endured since his injuries in April of 2012. In the three plus years since his injuries occurred, he has taken his life back to the fullest extent  driving, running, cycling and assisting other wounded veterans with rehabilitation through his foundation, The Travis Mills Foundation. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.It may also shock you to learn he harbors no animosity for ""the enemy,"" while providing straightforward descriptions about how things really are for our soldiers who are in the field under such harsh conditions. He also describes the deep commitment and loyalty he and the other troops share with each other.To say he is an inspiration would almost be insulting as it could never capture adequately the sheer force of his will and determination to live and to succeed. He does all of this with great compassion, humor and an undying love of country.Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332B9N8LD3UUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110190478X#wasThisHelpful","R332B9N8LD3UUM","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the bamboo version of a set of EMAX brushes I tried recently but it has a slightly different configuration of brush styles. This set comes with 12 brushes, a teardrop-shaped makeup sponge and a carry bag. The big difference with this set is that it contains Kabuki brushes for mineral powder, eyebrow and eyelash brushes and a flat (liquid) foundation brush, which I love, and really miss in the other sets of EMAX brushes I have tried. The pointy side of the teardrop sponge is also nice for liquid foundation because it gets into all the nooks around the eyes and nose that fingers can't get, though I still prefer the flat foundation brush for liquid makeup because it gives a really nice finish to the face.Like the other EMAX brush sets, these have a strong glue smell when you take them out of the bag and plastic that washes out with a little bit of gentle shampoo and an air dry. The smell completely disappears when washed. These brush heads are very soft for synthetic bristles with no strays popping out (I don't like stray bristles on my brushes!).This set includes a foundation brush, a big eye shadow brush, highlight brush, smudge brush, concealer brush, eyebrow brush, eyelash brush, small eye shadow brush, blusher brush, multifunction foundation brush, multifunction blush brush, Kabuki brush and a teardrop-shaped makeup sponge in pink (latex free and non-allergenic).I really like the bamboo handles on these brushes and the overall quality is nice for the price. At $15, this is a good value and makes a nice gift for a teenager as a first set or simply for people who just want a nice, inexpensive full set of brushes.These brushes are appropriate for use with liquids, powders and creams. They are handmade and are not supposed to shed for the lifetime of the brush. Time will show us whether or not this is true.Overall a very nice set of brushes that have a luxury feel to them, even more than some of the brushes I've received with some high-end prestige cosmetics.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"The backdrop for this novel is the U.S. Army's experimental nuclear power reactor (the SL-1 Nuclear Reactor in the high desert of Idaho), which had some type of steam explosion in January 1961 and killed three of its operators. I believe this is the only nuclear event in U.S. history that produced fatalities.Two years before this nuclear event, in 1959, Nat and her husband, Paul (a U.S. Army Specialist) move to Idaho Falls as Paul's assignment is to oversee the reactor's facilitation about 50 miles away from their home in Idaho Falls. With them are their two young daughters. Though Idaho Falls is a military town, it is still a remote and lonely place and Nat finds herself struggling with isolation and loneliness while Paul is working. Things were not 100% with them before the move and this has only exacerbated their problems.In the meantime, Paul has learned about a major safety issue that could potentially cause a lot of harm that his chain of command wants to cover up, not correct. He makes the decision to not tell Nat of the problems he is having at work and her restlessness grows. Paul is deployed for six weeks as a result of the conflict he is having with his boss over the state of the reactor and when Nat finds herself in need of help, a friendship blooms with a local man who is a help and a comfort to her during this time of isolation. This friendship is kept from Paul and the inventory of secrets they keep from each other continues to grow. Things go on like this for a while and rumors about Nat and her ""friend"" begin to make their way around.When the accident comes to fruition, Nat and Paul are forced to deal with breakdown of marriage head on.In The Longest Night, the author did an amazing job of re-creating the late 1950s/early 1960s in so thorough a way, I almost felt I was there. The story is told from varying perspectives that include Nat, Paul and Jeannie (the wife of Paul's superior officer). Each one of them, bring their own skewed perception of events to the table, provide food for thought and make sense, individually. As a whole, they couldn't be more different.This is a rather fascinating look behind the scenes of a rather big, but hidden away, event in U.S. history. You'll want to do a little research as you read this.Recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BU5ACH27CXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997743#wasThisHelpful","R38BU5ACH27CXE","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read much of Mary Gaitskill's work, including Veronica, I understand her to be extremely skilled at getting us invested in characters that are most definitely off the beaten path or even outright  unlikable in some situations. This is the story of a young Dominican girl named Velveteen Vargas, age 11, who is sent from her home in Brooklyn to upstate New York as part of the Fresh Air Fund program to send inner city kids to places that could potentially help them deal with the difficulties in their lives. Velveteen is sent to the home of Ginger and Paul, who, despite their own issues, want to make a difference in Velveteen's life. They are basically doing a dry run of what it might be like to adopt an older child and having Velveteen with them for a couple of weeks might shine some light on how this idea could play out.The differences in life in the city versus life in the country are significant, as you would imagine. Aside from an abusive home life, Velveteen must contend with an equally awful school environment. Her father is the absentee sort and her mother's constant working yields little in terms of money or luxury.Ginger is a recovering alcoholic and Paul is an academic. Paul is worried about Ginger's growing attachment to Velveteen. Silvia Vargas, Velveteen's mother is jealous of the relationship her daughter is forming with this new ""family."" Despite her harsh treatment of Velveteen, she does appear to love her daughter in her own flawed and frightened way.Add to this mix of people a horse named Fiery Girl, as damaged and fragile and untamable as her human counterpart, Velveteen, who has a natural way with her that does much to change Velveteen's future outlook despite the never-ending boulders that seem to line the road before her at every turn. This book really makes the case for how loving animals changes us and how the gifts they give us in return are numerous.With her usual expertise, Mary Gaitskill gets inside of the characters to present their innermost feelings from their most personal moments in life, rife with anger, sadness, despair and joy.Easy relationships are not always the most rewarding. Sometimes the difficult relationships are the ones that transform us for the long haul, despite our intentions at the outset.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TYG2QHES6ACB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307379744#wasThisHelpful","R3TYG2QHES6ACB","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure what the demand is for webcams these days considering that most laptops have their own webcams built in and smartphones are all set up for this already. I'm also not sure how big the audience is for webcam cameras but I guess there are still a small group of people without laptops or smartphones who could use this for chatting with their people in other places.The camera itself has a nice build quality to it. It comes packaged simply (which I like) and comes with a mini cd of drivers and what not, though you don't really need it since it's a plug and play type of camera.I tried this camera on two different laptops and I had some issues with it on both but no deal breakers. The main issue is a slight delay on both video and audio (worse on audio) so it's like when the voices don't sync to the video on a TV show. It's just a matter of a second or two so I can live with it if it's just being used on video calls.The quality of the video isn't bad, it's pretty good, in fact, although my iphone is somewhat better. The only sort of smallish issue is having to manually focus the camera before use so that you aren't blurry to whomever you might be chatting with via web services. Which is fine, if you're staying in one place or recording video for something without a lot of range of movement around the room while having a discussion. It's lightweight and sits atop the screen with a good amount of stability so it won't fall off if you tap the screen or move the laptop.Overall, it's a decent camera for video calls, though I wouldn't use it for other things like making youtube videos or other types of video projects.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"I really wanted to like these but there were a number of things that I found very unappetizing about them. First, they're an unattractive brown color in the dried form, which made them visually unappealing. Next, there were some stem bits on some of the berries that bothered me and the flavor is very unberry-like. It had more of a hardened raisin or slightly fig-like taste that I didn't expect or particularly like. I think I expected something more fruity in the flavor department, especially from a berry (like more of a freeze dried or dehydrated, crispier berry). The consistency was a little bit chewier than I thought they would be so the whole experience was not for me  visual, textural and flavorwise.I thought it was just me so I had several people try them but no one else really found them appealing, either.I guess these are just not to my taste.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"This is my first mud wrap experience. I'm trying to work on my upper arms, in particular, so that I have really good ones next summer during the sleeveless season (I have a lot of work to do so I'm starting early!).Since I'm coming from a place of not knowing what to expect or having nothing to compare this with, I will give you my impressions from a place of newness.So you first have to heat up the wrap in boiling water (15 minutes but I was afraid it would be too hot, so I did it for 10). Then you will need to mix the mud clay with water so that it's at a good consistency for spreading on the area you want to use it on (upper arms for me). Once the wrap is as hot as you want it, squeeze it out and wrap the area. It felt really good on with the warmth and when I removed the first application of it after about 75 mins (you're really supposed to keep it on for an hour but I got stuck on a phone call I couldn't end so I had an extra 15 mins), my skin felt really good. After that, I just kept in on for 75 mins at a time. Honestly, my arm appearance hasn't really changed with the three applications I've used but my skin feels really great and there is absolutely no dryness or need for extra lotion afterward. However, I do have a little bit of eczema that seems visibly calmer and a lot less scaly after using this product. So that's something.I guess these need to be used consistently and over time to see really visible results. Even so, I still like the process, which is very relaxing and refreshing. The mud (clay) pulls toxins from the skin and excess fluid, which I think will help with appearance over time. The clay is organic volcanic clay made with herbal extracts.One last observation I want to share. I thought this had a nice, mild and pleasant fragrance to it. Not overwhelming but enough to enhance to spa feel to the treatment.After a few applications, I will continue to use these and track my progress. If I eventually get the desired result that's image-worthy, I'll post pics as I have already taken a ""before"" photo. But even if I just come away with improvement to my skin afflicted with eczema, it would be worth it.This set comes with eight packets of volcanic clay and two reusable wraps.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"Given all the one-star reviews here, I can only imagine that some third-party vendors might be selling bootleg Belkin cables, which I'm somewhat surprised about. I'm pretty sure the 10-foot Belkin cable I received through Amazon Vine is the real thing. The cable is made with a heavy duty super thick vinyl or plastic housing. It works without a hitch and doesn't twist or tangle. I purposely didn't review it right away because I wanted to make sure it lasted a few weeks after reading the other reviews. I have other Belkin lightening cables, some for a few years, and they all still work flawlessly. This 10-foot model is perfect for when you need a longer length of cable, like when there's no outlet near your desk or table. Or even in a hotel room when you really have limited outlet real estate.\My advice to any potential buyer is to make sure your vendor is actually Amazon and not a third party vendor.

"This is marketed toward making nut milks (it comes with a recipe for almond milk). But, this is also great for making yogurt cheese or for preparing other cheeses for thickening (removing the whey). I love nut milks but I have heard about some of the things that go into them that I don't really like. Unfortunately, nut milk is the only beverage that transforms the taste of protein powder from completely non-palatable to kind of delicious. For whatever reason, almond milk tempers any bitterness from even the high-quality protein powders.The recipe that comes with this bag is just okay. It calls for the almonds to be soaked for six hours or more. In reality, the almonds should be soaked for two days, at least, in order to get the creaminess you want from them. Also, the almonds should be raw and the recipe doesn't state that. You can google better recipes. But this is a good bag for the straining portion and works really well. The mesh is a fine quality but easy enough to extract the liquid from the pulp. If you save the almond pulp, you can use it in cereal like oatmeal or dry it out in a low oven (around 200 degrees) until it's dry (almond meal). So there isn't any waste and raw almonds are extremely healthy for you.Easy to clean with dishwashing soap and hot water. Air dries quickly.

"This review is for the ThermoPro TP10 Digital Probe Oven Roasting Thermometer, which can be used as a meat thermometer as well as an oven temperature thermometer. It is programmed to measure the temperature for nine different meats and fish (ground beef, ground poultry, beef [steaks/roasts], veal, chicken, pork, poultry [other than chicken], lamb and fish). For each different meat setting, the LCD screen will provide colored light indications of when the meat is done (blue to start, green for almost done, red for fully cooked and ready to eat). This allows you to also select the desired ""taste"" outcome of the meat from rare all the way up to well done (five settings altogether). The light indicators adjust to the settings.The meat probe (thermometer) is made of food grade stainless steel with an angled tip. The length is about four inches so you can get it into the meat far enough to really get an accurate read. It can be used in temperatures up to 716 degrees but that's not anything I'd be dealing with. The screen is easy to read (outdoors too) and seems accurate as I tried it against another meat thermometer I know to be extremely accurate and both produced the identical temperature reading.This thermometer comes equipped with a built-in timer and AAA batteries (two) are provided in the package. This is also pretty easy to care for and clean by washing the probe in hot soapy water and wiping the unit with a damp cloth.This is a sturdy, efficient meat thermometer, which is appropriate for both indoor and outdoor cooking situations.I can recommend this without hesitation.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"I have this car charger in white and it rivals any of the shiny white car chargers you'd buy at the Apple store. Except for one thing, I like this one even better than the expensive charger I originally purchased at the Apple store. This one is a fraction of the cost, with two USB ports (the Apple charger I spent $30 on a few years back only has one).The two ports are 1 Amp and 2.4 Amps for charging quickly, depending on the device you're charging. This is a smart charger so it will adjust Amperage to the device, depending upon what the specific device can handle. You won't have to worry about damaging a device if the Amperage is too high. Pretty great.Like other car chargers, there is an indicator light (blue) when the charger is plugged into the car's outlet. The USB ports on the unit are labeled so that you know how the Amps are divvied up. So it gives you everything you need to efficiently charge two devices on the go, without worry.Excellent charger.

"Wow! What an amazing facial steamer. I used it several times before reviewing it to see how it worked on my skin over a couple of weeks so I could review it more effectively. Now I can really see and feel a difference in my skin, which feels deeply cleaned with a silky texture.It works just like a professional steamer in a salon that opens the pores and clears debris and preps the skin for blackhead removal. I don't have a lot of blackhead activity as a middle aged person but I do have exfoliation issues that constantly need to be addressed.  Dry, unexfoliated skin clogs pores and creates eruptions over time (at least with my skin) so it's nice to have this at home to clear up some of the deeper areas that are missed by simple exfoliation scrubs.The steamer itself is lovely. Nicely designed and pretty. It kind of looks like a pretty, pink-detailed water pitcher. Also, it's lightweight and very easy to use. You must use filtered water or distilled water in this to prevent operational issues that come from using unfiltered water over time (calcium buildup). You have to fill the tank as indicated so that a good pure steam is produced from the vaporizer. While the instructions say that you could potentially use this once per day for up to 10 minutes, that's not really a good idea. Two to three times per week should be adequate for most people (I'm doing two). Each full tank of water is good for about 10 minutes of steady steam. It takes less than a minute to heat up and release steam and will shut off automatically when the tank has been depleted of water.This is an ionic steamer that through the Positive Thermal Coefficient (PTC) ceramic heating element, it adds an additional element of clean water vaporization. This steamer has a UV lamp that sterilizes the vapor before it arrives on the skin so you're only getting good, clean steam going into your pores. There's an internal fan that that directs the steam and gives it the power to penetrate the skin through layers, which is supposed to help with natural collagen production. The steam is also supposed to help with dark spots over time but that remains to be seen. It definitely helps to reduce potential breakouts.I'm very happy with this steamer and hope to be using it for years.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"This is a surprisingly small AV to HDMI converter. I don't know why I thought it would be big. I used it to hook up somewhat older camera to my LG TV and viewing was amazing. You can change the resolution output by pressing the button to adjust to 720p or 1080p output. This is a very simple device to operate  plug and play.The unit comes with a mini USB cable and USB power adaptor. The small size of this makes it very easy to use it in different rooms or to carry with you should you need it elsewhere.This build quality of this converter is stellar. For its small size, it's well-made and configured for easy use. Not that you really need the instructions because this sets up and operates intuitively, but they are included with the cables and the unit.This is a fine little converter that will get a lot of use in my house.Very nice.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"This is a very well-made selfie stick. Its strong (even when extended to the full length of almost three feet) and looks expensive (but its not). When collapsed, its but a mere fraction of its fully extended size (about eight inches) and fits easily into a pocket or purse.Big plus is the detachable remote so that you dont have to fiddle with positioning your hand in any weird way to both hold the stick in position and press the button. The clamp adjusts to work with phones that have their cases on them. It uses a coin battery and pairs easily to other devices (in seconds) by pressing the remote and holding it for three seconds. I'm undecided about whether I like selfie sticks that are rechargeable more than the ones that have batteries since, in either case, if you lose power, you still have the option to use the phone on timer mode and have time to extend and position the photo content. So either way, its kind of the same thing.There is a good amount of swivel to adjust the shot and its easy to manipulate.This is a good stick, portable and durable.Love it.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"I contend with dead spots in my apartment that drive me crazy. Since I recently updated some of my equipment, I couldn't figure out the source of the problem and needed some help. I set this up in my kitchen, which is one room away from the main router. Honestly, I wasnt expecting a lot from this but it actually helped once I got it up and running.This is fairly simple to set up. Plug it in and follow the step-by-step instructions to connect it with your current wi fi configuration. You'll need to create a password for security purposes so that you arent supplying free wifi to the neighbors. This worked especially well with my cellular in the dead zones of my apartment. I even had wifi outside of my apartment as I was walking out of the building, which really surprised me. I noticed that my streaming is so much better now too. Im doing the happy dance.This is a simple solution for extending wifi in various situations, whether thats due to large square footage, too many devices or in my case, mystery dead spots. Its simple to use, quick to set up and solved a big problem for me.Reasonably priced and a good value.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"This is a very nice, small, lightweight air pump.

"This little speaker is a perfect speaker for kids. Its small and lightweight, has a cute little handle, is brightly colored, has a nice solid plastic housing and is very portable. Its good for little hands or can be clipped to their backpacks or belt loop (comes with a carabiner clip). I also say its good for kids because the sound quality is just adequate and more seasoned adults might find some fault in it that kids would likely not.Another thing is that it speaks to the user in Chinese and I dont think there is a way to change it. Thats probably something that needs to change for each language this product is getting marketed to. Im sure the U.S. is not the only country this will get distributed to. Instructions are in Chinese but fortunately there are only four buttons and we all (I hope) know how to pair devices. This one took a few tries to pair because it wasnt recognizing my phone.

"I needed a little help with the electrical installation so I had a friend help install it. It was pretty easy in the end for someone who knew what they were doing. This is being used to turn lights on and off but this can be used for a variety of timing situations. It can accommodate up to 18 but Im using it for two (two sets of lights) and so far so good. Im thinking that adding the a/c to it next summer might be a good idea to prevent walking into a boiling house.That said, the instructions were a bit convoluted, for lack of a better word. We figured it out but for someone who maybe is a little less tech savvy, this might be a bit complicated if following the instruction manual alone. I received an updated set of instructions by email that were slightly better than what arrived in the package.The other thing that is a bit frustrating is the limited time you have to make adjustments to the programming because if you hesitate for even a moment or try to look at the instructions, it reverts and you have to begin again. Once its programmed, its fine. But the road to fine is rocky at best.At the end of the day, it does the job it proclaims it will.

"As eye masks go, this is a good one. The main thing I like about it is having eye cavities that allow for blinkage. And by blinkage, I mean enough eyelash-clearing space so that you can blink without your lashes touching any part of the mask. Full blinking clearance. Thats pretty great.Also, the strap is very secure with an adjustable Velcro closure that stays put while you sleep. It will adjust to a variety of head sizes.One minor issue is light leakage when you sleep on your side as the mask no longer makes full contact with the face when one side of your head is against the pillow. But its not a huge deal, especially at night. However, people who need to use a mask to block out daylight may take issue with this so I mention it for that reason.The material that this is made of is soft and smooth, almost like the material that the newer types of padded bras are made of.The fact that this is machine washable is an added bonus although I prefer to hand wash with a gentle soap.

"This silicone wristwatch/pedometer is similar to other pedometers except that you dont clip it to your belt or pocket. Its a wristwatch with a cool slap band that adjusts to wrist size from child size to grown man size and everything in between. I do a lot of walking in New York City and like to get my 10,000 steps in each day. This is a nice way to keep track of those counts. It works like a pedometer in that you measure your stride and set the settings and time, etc. This charges via mini USB (cable included).I compared my clip on pedometer to this one and there was a slight difference in steps (about 50 less than the clip on). I might have to jigger with my stride setting to see if I can get this closer to my very accurate clip on pedometer. The numbers are close enough that I think I can fix this through adjustments in order to calibrate the two.This watch is perfect for the person who may not have a smart phone or a person who may not like using apps to count steps. Or who may want just the basics. You just slap it on and go, count your steps and be done with it.

"This is not something I need every day. I need this for road trips and long drives to distant shores. That's a bit dramatic but this really is a great device for when you have a few things that need charging on a long road trip (phone, GPS, ipod, etc). Having it all in one place is helpful. This has a nice long cord so I can place it anywhere I need it on the dash area so that I can reach it (they include a 3M adhesive but I like to keep it loose so I can move it around as needed).The big thing I like about this charger, aside from converting one outlet into three, the outlets are individual and you can power on one at a time or all three at once. They each have their own power button. I also think it's fairly well-made, though it will be time that will provide the evidence of this.So now here's the other thing. The display is a little bit lacking in readability and usefulness. First, in daylight, forget trying to read the display. Just plug in and forget about it. Second, this charger displays the interior car temperature (Yay!) but it's only in Celsius (Boo!). If you plan to market this in the U.S., at least make sure it displays in Fahrenheit. Just an observation. If there is a way to switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit, I can't figure it out. And you can't switch the display language from Chinese to English (as far as I can tell). So there's that, too.Anyway, the main functionality is excellent as chargers go.

"Solar-powered lights solve the age-old dilemma of lighting up the trees and bushes in the yard when there are no outlets with which to plug your lights in. Not a fan of extension cords out in the elements, either. Luckily, solar power saves the day. This is a strand of 100 LED lights that can easily be hung or strung over a wreath or a bush. These are dainty lights, aptly named ""fairy lights,"" which can be used year round as these are not specific to the winter holidays. They have a couple of different modes to select from  ""long bright"" and ""single flash.""  They have a day to night sensor so that they charge all day (8  10 hours) and run for 6  8 hours in the dark. The solar battery will continue to charge even if you have the light switch in the off position.While these are water resistant, it's not a good idea for these to get saturated. The instructions state that these will work normally in the rain but I guess maybe not so well in a torrential downpour. Maybe these are best utilized for a wreath on a door that has some protection provided to it. You can definitely use LED lights on a wreath since they don't get too hot like the standard lights. Nothing will be bursting into flames, in other words.The set includes the lights with solar panel, a ground spike for positioning the solar panel and the user manual.These are very nice lights appropriate for a variety of uses on a year-round basis.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"This is a great little camera set up. It works on Wi-Fi and a phone app. Through the app, I can scan a room with a swipe of my finger on the screen, change the settings, hear audio and speak back and the list goes on. It even records audio. If you're at work and someone at home needs you, like an elderly person or the babysitter, they can communicate. The camera is very good and the video is pretty clear for a ""cam"" of sorts.This is also cutely designed, lightweight and minimalist in design, which I like, because it blends into the surroundings. It's like a baby robot. You can place this on a shelf or mount it to the wall in a corner of the room or even on the ceiling (if you had an outlet on the higher end of the wall because the cord is only a little more than three feet) with the included mounting hardware.The camera is adjustable to night vision with its infrared lights positioned around the lens. You can change the mode to night from the app, which has a nice, easy-to-use interface (from your phone). There is an indicator light when the device is powered on and this can be used with an Ethernet cable if you don't have Wi-Fi for some reason. There is also a micro SD card slot on the back of the device too. You will need the SD card for taking instant snapshots or to record video since there is no internal memory in the actual camera. I think you can go up to 32 GBs. And you do get a one-year subscription to Amazon's cloud.This camera will work with iphone and android phones because they have the app capability that other phones don't have. You can otherwise set up a desktop version (Desktop PC Client) if you still have a flip phone (do they still make those?).Set up was fairly easy after a rather lengthy boot up (a couple of minutes at least). I used Wi-Fi by pairing via the WPS button on my router. When you download the app, you scan the QR code on the device and that's how the app recognizes your camera. Very easy setup.That's the good news. The bad news is the app is a little bit buggy (I had to remove a star for this), especially when trying to schedule recordings. But you can record continuously as well, 24 hours a day (audio and video) and you can adjust the quality of the video, too, from the app. The video resolution is pretty good quality and the audio is decent, not great, because it picks up background noise but you still get a coherent, understandable audio track. I am confident the app will improve with updates.This is a nice little security camera useful for so many things.Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

Over time, David's behavior changed. Infidelity, bouts of mania and depression, and generally, erratic, volatile behavior became a regular occurrence. David tried prescription drugs but these, ultimately did more damage and he hit a low, having to be hospitalized. He was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, spent a couple of months in the hospital and then ended his life. In the wake of this, he left behind a legacy of grief and lots of messes to clean up, including a large amount of debt.Sheila's quest for answers led to her writing this book. The emotional toll of loving a person whose behavior is frightening and dangerous is incredibly sad and confusing. She also highlights all of the inconsistencies in the healthcare system that cause so many mentally ill patients to fall through the cracks. It's an extremely overwhelming and frustrating topic. I felt profound sadness, not just in Sheila's personal story but for those people who fall through the cracks and end up with dire consequences, not just for themselves but for others.This is a compelling book, which also provides a lot of factual information and data about mental illness that will sadden and surprise you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWN3YS8LYCLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580055842#wasThisHelpful","R2MWN3YS8LYCLI","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Told from the point of view of ""Music,"" The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto opens up at the funeral of Frankie, a musical genius and superstar. ""Music,"" the narrator and giver of musical talent, has gifted Frankie with exceptional musical talent. Frankie was born during the Spanish Civil War and orphaned. His life is almost pre-destined to become a superstar. On the road to superstardom, Frankie crosses paths with many other superstars, whose names come from the top tiers of the entertainment industry.What struck me are the similarities to fame today  or at least the quest for it  and the journey from unknown to megastar. ""Music"" has this sort of emotionless manner in that he is only narrating, rather than judging Frankie's management and use of his gifts. Frankie's quest for fame is almost like a drug, partly composed of the life-changing impact his music has had on others and the life-altering tolls it has taken on him. It has given so much to him, yet it has stolen things from him, too. The pleasures/burdens of superstardom permeate every fiber of his being.I felt like I was reading the biography of a real person backed by a musical soundtrack. Upon his death, we are left with questions. What mysteries are behind Frankie's talent and what influenced Frankie's drive? And, is there a bigger message in the story of Frankie's life? I don't know.  It's not as clear as some of Albom's other books. For me, viewing Frankie's life from the rather unemotional perspective of ""Music"" provided some food for thought. We may think we know or speculate upon what motivates a public figure, but we really know nothing of the person underneath the outer shell of fame.Interesting, well-written and thought-provoking.Recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18B8YTRLK8I15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294415#wasThisHelpful","R18B8YTRLK8I15","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I judged this book by its cover and it paid off, big time. It's about 50-something John Nichols, who comes to the table with A LOT of baggage.  That baggage includes adultery, divorce and lots of ""ex"" careers amongst other things. He also has a teen-aged developmentally challenged son (Ethan) he has the main responsibility for and two grown daughters (Karen and Mindy).There's a lot of stuff going on. A LOT.Even with all of his ""issues"" (for lack of a better word), John is a caring sort and keeps trying. His daughter, Karen, is getting married and John decides to take Ethan on a road trip to the wedding in Charleston, SC, to avoid unpleasantness on an airplane (Ethan has airplane history John wants to avoid). But things still come up en route on the road trip that are stressful and challenging. And this is all before John proceeds to make an announcement to the family that is somewhat shocking. Karen has some sharing to do as well. And John's ex-wife, Mary, will also be in attendance, which is another problem, as John still has a thing for her.The lion's share of the book deals with the unfolding of John's earlier pronouncement, of which you will need to read the book to learn the subject of. Some of this story was difficult to read without getting emotional but much of it is also humorous and told with a certain kind of honesty that highlights the best in a group of flawed, fumbling people. This group of people add new insights into dysfunction in families.But I have to stop and say something about how well-written this book was and what a pleasure it was to read, despite some of the unpleasant moments (meaning difficult emotionally).At the end of the day, there is a lot of love on the pages of this book, despite life's challenges presented therein and it's definitely worth the time it took it took to read (I had to put it down every once in a while to reflect).Definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V61C0M3AEG6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250036054#wasThisHelpful","R3V61C0M3AEG6Z","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We can all practice a little bit of forgiveness, especially when doing so will relieve pain (your own). This is something that is common to everyone, religious or not, though this book is religious in nature and uses Joseph's story to present lessons on forgiveness. Joseph had lots to forgive others for (he was sold into slavery by his brothers, for one thing).Forgiveness is a lot bigger than you might think it is. While we can learn to forgive others, it's often harder to forgive yourself. The study is divided into lessons that are helpful for unearthing the hidden anger and pain we carry around. There are six weeks of lessons that cover acknowledging pain, waiting to be remembered, your dreams, the roller coaster of emotions, setting boundaries and moving forward in life.At the end of the six weeks of lessons, the author provides a reading list of books that focus on the forgiveness process. Even without the religious ramifications of this book, there's value in taking steps to forgive people, not for their sake but for yours.Recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSUJFGZIDZRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426789106#wasThisHelpful","R1XSUJFGZIDZRH","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is yet another version of the Common English Bible (CEB). I have just reviewed the YA version of the CEB Bible, which I thought was a nice translation that made Bible facts and stories more readable and identifiable to the YA demographic. This CEB Bible is the Deep Blue Kids Bible and features a ""soft"" hardcover with a beautiful teal sea of fish swimming across the cover. Since this book is for the younger set (maybe about 7  11 years), it features kid-friendly illustrations, cartoon people, Nat Geo maps and lots of nice color.The actual text is more of a storytelling type of translation with a child-appropriate introduction and facts set apart from the text in the form of notes that are useful in explaining important bits and pieces of the text in language that a child could better comprehend. I especially like the introductions to the people we will get to know in each book. As with the YA edition, there are some very nice maps included in this that put a face on the geography and logistics of the time.This is a lovely little Bible, though for the younger age range of kids you might select this for, you may have to read it with them since the print is small and there's a lot of it.Recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAOA9OAJU5SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261917#wasThisHelpful","RHAOA9OAJU5SF","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Bible is a ""Common English Bible,"" which presents the old testament as well as the new testament in language that is more understandable and relatable. I believe this particular translation is a YA level translation. But I found that what I read of it is also appropriate for adults. I wish I had had one of these when I was going through catholic school. It would have made it way more understandable, in general.This CEB edition also features a lot of extras like historical introductions that precede each book so that you can have some context in your head before diving in. There are also opinions and writings from biblical scholars that present additional food for thought as well as some philosophical type questions to ponder. The inclusion of maps is a nice touch. I found the maps helpful for understanding the geographical logistics found across the pages of the Bible.Even for people who are not religious, this is an interesting version to read as a piece of historical material. My feeling is that hardcore Christians and maybe some Jewish scholars could find fault in some of the more modern translations and storytelling. But I found it tells the stories in a more straightforward manner. And if it gets a person to read this just once in their lifetime, it's worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4R80HR3343X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261798#wasThisHelpful","R2C4R80HR3343X","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You could say this is a book about three men. Or you could say this is about four men. Free Men by Katy Simpson Smith deals with the various levels of disenfranchisement of three men: an American Indian (Istillicha), a white man (Cat) and a black man (Bob). On their heels is the fourth man  LeClerc  tracking them. These four men are connected because of circumstances that have put them together, all of them symbolic of something other than what they are. Together they are the physical (American Indian wildness), the mental (white man's intellect) and the emotional (black man's heart of darkness) components of man, for good or bad, with the upper class (LeClerc) condescending to understand the elements beneath him (um, and he's French) before he must kill them.The year is 1788 and the story takes place over 14 days in March. Bob is a slave on the run from a life he has tried to accept but has come to understand as a life of slow death with no hope. Cat is a hopeless, lonely mute who has only known abuse and death. Like Bob, his life has been a prison. Istillicha is a member of the Creek tribe who has been overlooked by his people and betrayed by a woman he loved who has robbed him, not only of his silver but of the trust he once had in his heart. Defiant and angry, he leaves the tribe to seek retribution with the intention of someday returning and taking what he believes is his rightful place among the tribe.As these three men find themselves thrown together, a fateful decision is made to act upon an opportunity that has presented itself, ultimately resulting in tragedy and finding themselves in the position of being hunted.As the story progresses, we learn more about each man and what came before their fateful union. We also learn a lot about LeClerc and his intentions for the men. I will stop there without spoiling this masterpiece.I haven't read anything since The Heart is a Lonely Hunter that has so affected and moved me. Though this time period and Southern location are so far out of my personal existence, there is something in each of these men that corresponds to some of the deepest places in the human soul.Reading this will make you question your own life and intentions in ways that will challenge what you one thought you believed about yourself.Recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34J8SSTPSUHPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062407597#wasThisHelpful","R34J8SSTPSUHPO","A2FNA5903D9E6Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNA5903D9E6Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second of two phone mounts by Comsun that I have had the opportunity to try out. Unlike the first one I reviewed, this one is more suited to phones with a smaller case as I don't think the bulkier defender cases would work in this holder. In a way, this holder is like a little seat you mount to your bike handle and the phone sits in it with the help of a spring-action clamp that grabs the phone on the sides as well elastic banding that goes over the phone. The main problem is not having a defender-type case on the phone during certain biking conditions could be disastrous to the phone. The bands that are used to help secure the phone work well now but the material looks like it could deteriorate with use. I would feel safer with silicone bands but that's just me.It's a nicely manufactured phone holder and it's also very handsome (as bike phone mounts go) but there are few things that need to be addressed. First, if you have the type of bike that has a straight handlebar, the side-to-side rotation (via the ball rotating mechanism) becomes obstructed because it can only turn just so much to the right or left thanks to the bar. I'm not sure what the fix is other than to extend it up a bit from the bar so that range of motion is freer. No problem adjusting up or down, though.The spring-action clamp that holds the phone doesn't seem to make contact with my phone solidly. This problem stems from the clamps being semi-circular with cut outs on the sides so your phone only makes contact with a portion of a semi-circle (see the images in the product description). The simple solution to this is to make the clamps rectangular in shape and without cut outs. Problem solved.To me this is a good, solid bike mount for smaller phones, which don't require as much adjustment as a bigger phone (like the 6 or 6 plus) would need. I don't think the iphone 6 plus would even fit in this. I tried a 6 and a 5 with minimal cases. The phone stays in the clamp until you unlock it by pushing a safety button. The 6 was a tight fit. The 5 was much better and in fact, a very good fit for this (but not with a big case). Moving on, there are absolutely no issues securing this to the handlebar. It screws on and stays put very well. This was one area that felt very stable.At the end of the day, this is a nice bike phone mount for smaller phones, with enough protection for leisure bikers. I would say that for people in a more hardcore biking environment, this isn't going to be the best choice. However, Comsun has another bike mount that is really excellent and would work with a wider range of phones. Do a quick search.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"First, this case is sleek and very good looking. The feel of it in my hand is like silk but not slippery. This means less opportunity to have it slip out of your hand. However, if you do happen to drop your phone, this is not a very protective case. If you drop your phone and hit the corner, which seems to be ground zero for screen cracks, your phone will take the hit but not in a good way. This is what accounts for the one-star deduction on this review. But this is not specific to this case. A corner drop on most iphones will be detrimental on any case without extra corner protection, which this does not have.That aside, for people who don't like big bulky cases and tend not to use a case at all, this could work. It adds no bulk, looks elegant and minimal and protects the phone from scratches and other body issues. And a big one  it won't get in the way of charging ports on charging docks.The cut outs are perfect, very precise.  This looks like an expensive, high-end phone case but at $9.99. A steal.I like this case a lot. It's very well-made with a lot of attention to detail in the manufacturing process.If you like a minimalist look and need a case for scratch protection, this is a very good choice.

"I have tried a few types of this spray. When I received the first sample, I was convinced it was a goof. Spoiler alert  this is not a goof. It's really interesting and kind of ingenious, in fact.The concept is simple. You spray the water in the toilet before, you know, and it creates a top layer (invisible) that traps any unpleasantness below the surface of the water. It really works. I am amazed.The one I received is ""Santorini Breeze,"" which kind of smells like the boardwalk of a beach more than the breeze. It's a pleasant, not overwhelming scent.This is a small, 2-ounce bottle but it's good for 200 uses and that's certainly a good deal. This is made from natural ingredients that won't send more toxins into the environment. You can also carry this in a purse or suitcase and it will not leak thanks to the leak proof gasket technology in the cap.Perfect for a stocking stuffer goof. Or not.

"Okay, up front I have to say I love this little gadget. I've been thinking of upgrading my car stereo (it's not the most up to date, let's just say) because I wanted Bluetooth compatibility and to be able to play the content from my iphone. Now I can. And I am very happy by how this device works.It's really the simplest thing as all you need to do is pair the transmitter via Bluetooth to your phone and then set your transmitter to an FM station that corresponds to the number on your car stereo  it worked on a number of different frequencies in my car. Like magic, what's on your phone comes out of your car stereo. In stereo.I made a few test phone calls and that worked really well  no hissing noises or interference. And the transmitter automatically switches to phone mode so you don't have to compete with the caller and your stereo blaring in the background.This is also very pretty. I have the rose-colored transmitter. It fits right into the power outlet in the car and then you can rotate the face of it to whatever position you need the transmitter to be in to operate. On the stem of this is a USB port so that you can also charge your phone while using the transmitter. Charging was equivalent to any other standard car charger so I didn't notice anything strange unusual there.  It also supports use of a TF card but I've never used TF cards so I cannot speak to that functionality, specifically.There is a microphone on the face of the device as well as a knob for adjusting the frequency and volume buttons. The lights are a pretty blue that match the blue lights in my car at night. But the lights are high contrast and very visible even in sunlight. That is fantastic.Overall, this is an excellent transmitter that worked with my iphone with little to no effort. I'm very, very happy with this. Excellent price, too ($19.99 at the time of this review).Recommend.I received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

"Anyone who rides a bike has a big old protective case on their phone. That's a given. If you're going to use your phone or phone GPS while riding, it's best to have a bike mount that can accommodate a phone with a big protective case on it. This one is really interesting because it's small but it has a rubber frame around it that stretches out to fit the frame of the phone and whatever case you have on the phone. It really accommodates all sizes of phone cases.The handlebar mount has rotating ball on the underside of the mount and can be adjusted to fit different bike bar sizes. So if you have more than one type of bike, you can easily switch this from one to the other. The rotation is nice and smooth and doesn't move once you rotate the phone to where you want it.In addition to the rubber frame, there is a spring-loaded clip (like the kind you would use on a dashboard) that adjusts to fit the width of the phone while the rubber holds it in place on the corners.

"I love these pruning shears. The really big deal is having handles that are comfortable AND small enough for my hands.

You can tell that these are well-made and aligned properly just by looking at them straight from the packaging.

"WOW!  This is simply a stunning film (not sure if this comes in an English version, but my copy was in French with English subtitles)!  Powerful and nuanced, with great acting and story line.  I won't go into details like so many have before here, but suffice it to say that it is a story about how 2 completely different people randomly meet in a quiet French town, and feed off each other's differences with a curiosity and fascination.

A 'must see'!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TUP6KM9XMEL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JG9ZWY#wasThisHelpful","R2TUP6KM9XMEL2","A7EJERNB7IK3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EJERNB7IK3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is truly one of the best films of recent times.  I won't convey the story line (it's been written many times already here), but it is a hardscrabble journey where love ultimately wins out over gold.  The acting is excellent and believable, and the the many scenes of hardship, poverty, and crime provide a proper canvas for this tale.  There is a lot of empathy felt the 2 main protagonists here.  Ultimately, true love reigns supreme, which also makes it a 'feel good' movie.  The clever interspersed cutting between Jamal's appearance on the popular game show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' (Indian version), and the unfolding of his story which supports the successive answers he gets all correct is pure cinematic genius.  Do not miss this film!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0F6A70UU1H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P9KR8U#wasThisHelpful","R1E0F6A70UU1H6","A7EJERNB7IK3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EJERNB7IK3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of hard rock/metal's signature moments in time!  With the great Don Dokken and George Lynch 'firing on all cylinders', they crafted some killer, melodic tunes here, that stand the test of time.  As a Dokken fan, I equally love 'Tooth And Nail', 'Under Lock And Key', and 'Back For The Attack'.  All 3 are top notch albums within the genre, and George Lynch plays perfect metal guitar to boot.  His ungodly great riffs, lead, and biting tone are the stuff of legend!

Just as a goof, I placed one inside my car (after sundown), parked towards the end of my driveway (i'm on a dark street), and sat down while passersby gawked at, and made comments about 'that colorful glow' emanating from my vehicle!

"I'll get right to the point.  America doesn't hold a candle to Europe when it comes to fine, creamy, superior tasting chocolates!  While the idea for a bacon and chips milk chocolate bar is great (i've tasted others too), Hammond's milk chocolate is just plain mediocre at best, and can't compare to the likes of Perugina or Lacta (both European).  Even Cadbury blows it away.  So any attempt at making this specialty chocolate bar taste great is negated by the uninspiring and forgettable taste of this milk chocolate.

"The 'Hefty' brand touch-lid, 13.3 gallon trash cans (the come in different colors; mine is black) are FANTASTIC, well thought out, well-made products!  Throughout the years, i've had way more expensive, foot-operated stainless steel trash bins, and many malfunctioned or stopped working completely within a short period of time.  Not so with these Hefty cans.  I've always had the best luck with these inexpensive, no-nonsense touch-lid cans, and they are the best at containing smells too.  Kitchen size, 13 gallon trash bags fit perfectly around the lip of the can as well (unlike some other cans).  We had our last Hefty touch-lid for at least 5 years, until I ran over the lid by mistake (left the can and lid on the driveway to wash/hose it down, which I do twice a year)!  I know it's kind of strange reviewing a kitchen trash bin, BUT I considered that I use this product several time a day.

"I am really getting tired of having to spend my precious time online, giving negative reviews for once decent products that have been cheapened and 'cost cut'!  This is becoming epidemic in these United States, and the consumer needs to wake up and demand better quality from these ripoff companies!  Just a few years ago, companies like Hanes or Fruit Of The Loom used quality materials and manufacturing to build skivvies that actually FIT well, provided support for the 'family jewels', and did not sag or rip.  Not anymore!  The quality has plummeted noticeably, and I cannot seem to find underwear that fits and supports well!  Even the cheap elastic waist bands lost their elasticity and strength within 2 to 3 wears! These companies should be ashamed of themselves!

"I *finally* found a healthy, proper multivatamin (with Omega 3's) for my 9 year old daughter!  I had been using 'Nature Made' gummies, which is OK, but this excellent multivitamin is a cut above.  I've read online reviews and spoken to health and nutrition experts, and many had mentioned the 'Smarty Pants' brand as being the safest and best made vitamin.  My wife had also received samples from this company in her 'Birchbox' or 'Conscious Box' (I don't recall which one), and we liked what we read on the ingredients list.  And my child LOVES the taste!  My only gripe would be that the container states that the dosage is 4 per day.  I give her 3 a day, which will make the product last longer, and in my opinion, still gives her a good dose of vitamins and Omega 3.  In the past, i've had 2 doctors that told me that you don't need multivitamins every day, and to just take them every other day.  So I figure 3 instead of 4 is OK.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVG72IZQO1PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QQ9LVS#wasThisHelpful","RGVG72IZQO1PZ","A7EJERNB7IK3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EJERNB7IK3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I needed a decent pair of reading glasses ('cheaters'), and my wife picked me up this pair from 'OfficeMax'.  I am very dissapointed.  I've had many pairs of reading glasses over the years, and this pair is not 'optically correct', as the product tag states.  Looking through these glasses, images don't seem natural, and I get a slight headache from doing so.  The frame was also slightly bent when I got these, and I must have spent about 15 minutes trying to bend them back to a comfortable, correct shape.  In addition, the lenses do not clean as easily as other glasses I have, and smudges seem hard to get rid of at times.  I must therefore conclude that these are lower quality 'cheaters', and not worth the hassle and dissapointment.

"We (wife and I) have all The Connells' stuff on CD.  This debut release sounds a bit different than the rest, but is excellent and honest, nonetheless.  The songs are very well written, with some excellent R.E.M. or The Church-like jingly-jangly guitar driven melodies, and the whole thing has a very British aura and feel to it.  Whether he knew it or not, their vocalist often sounds a bit like Morrissey and The Smiths, as someone else had mentioned here in a previous Amazon review.  This is not a bad thing, since anything by The Smiths is fantastic, IMHO.

My dear, beautiful dad passed away recently, and left me a lot of music in the form of LP's.

Detection and elimination rates are very high, and in some cases, perfect!  I have also read that this cloud-based Panda product outperforms many commercial antivirus software suites that one has to pay for!  In my specific case, I was getting sick and tired of paying a rapacious yearly renewal fee for my Norton360 antivirus (about 90 dollars!), when it was available online for much less!  One would thank that Symantec would charge a steady, loyal customer less for their product, not more.  So I removed (cancelled) Norton360 from 3 of my PC's, and installed Panda Free Antivirus 2015 on them.  I also continue to use Malwarebytes (a free anti-malware, anti-spyware software) as a second line of defense (I do periodic scans), and I have had no issues or infections.

"I am in love with my hair!!!! So I was offered this purple rain semi permanent hair color for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I was also got 2 other colors and decided to use this purple rain and the blue I got. I went to my normal hair stylist and she was up for the challenge. I put my before picture in as well as a few after pictures. So she didn't color my entire head but instead went in where she's been doing my highlights and did mostly purple rain and threw in a few of the blue. The first thing she noticed as a salon owner, was the vibrant color these had just on the application. Then, we both noticed the smell. It smells like fruit!! We think the purple is grape. Just amazing!! So we let it sit for about a half hour and rinsed out with cold water as directed. She saw it on the towel so told me not to sleep on white sheets, lol. Before it was dried, she kept saying how vibrant and bright this color is compared to any other colors and brands she's tried in all her years of styling hair. She dried my hair and we both stared at amazement. I am literally in love with my hair and she is going to start using this brand for colors. My hair smelled of grapes until my first wash a few days later and has been running in the shower each time I've washed it, which is expected since its a semi permanent color. The color has faded some but is still just as fabulous as it was almost 3 weeks ago. I definitely recommend this purple rain semi permanent grape scented hair color for anyone who wants an amazing hair color!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWQV552YQIUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147R9UIY#wasThisHelpful","R1YWQV552YQIUA","A1NHCOCKU6SFG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NHCOCKU6SFG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: I've continued to test the accuracy of this scale against the EatSmart and just now found a good 15.0 pound reference weight that I could easily put on the platforms. So, which scale is more accurate? The answer is neither, not really. The Smart Weight reads 14.8 pounds, while the EatSmart reads 15.2. Plus/minus 1 percent is still excellent, but if you're using the Smart Weight, adjust your weight up by 1 percent to get your true weight.ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you want to add a touch of dazzling elegance to your bathroom, this scale is a real tour de force. The manufacturer was kind enough to provide me with a silver unit for review, and it makes my treasured EatSmart scale look clunky in comparison. The pictures of the Smart Weigh scale simply don't do it justice. It has a very slim profile and sits significantly lower than the EatSmart. The platform is also somewhat larger than the EatSmart, by about 0.75 inches per side. This doesn't sound like much, but the difference actually makes the Smart Weigh scale much easier to stand on to get a stable reading.Operating the scale is simple. Put in the batteries, zero it out by tapping on the scale, and then stand on it long enough for the scale to take a reading. The first time you do this, your weight is stored in memory and used for future comparisons. Future readings flash in green if your weight goes down and red if it goes up. Getting a good benchmark reading (e.g., first thing in the morning) is pretty important, since that's what your weight is judged against. I had no trouble making this system work.Add a second or third person, and the scale figures it out, up to eight people. My companion tested it along with me, and the scale correctly tagged her weight. But she wasn't happy with the red light.Prefer metric over English? A push button on the underside of the scale lets you change. It appears to adjust the memory reading accordingly. It also will weigh you in stones, if need be.The weight readings are very stable from one reading to the next. The weighing mechanism doesn't introduce random fluctuations. My own weight readings were consistently 1.2 pounds less (-0.6%) of my EatSmart readings. If I can get a good reference weigh, I will report further on  which of the two is most accurate. Since the readings over time are consistent, however, this is an excellent scale for tracking weight gain and loss.When I agreed to review this scale, I didn't really think I needed anything other than the EatSmart. The Smart Weigh persuaded me otherwise. It's easy to use and beautiful to look at.UPDATE (3/31): I've found that it's relatively easy to set up one's self as a second user profile by accident. This can lead to confusing displays, so don't throw away the instructions. They're needed to delete one or all profiles. I deleted everything. This corrected the display. I also found that the difference between this scale and my EatSmart dropped to 0.6 pounds. More updates on accuracy and consistency later.NOTE: if you buy this scale, make sure you receive the cover to the battery compartment. Mine came without one, causing some difficulty in day to day operation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2404OSL7Q5L3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1U42YO#wasThisHelpful","R2404OSL7Q5L3U","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lynnette asked me to review her book, and I accepted. I also explained that I'm not a good reviewer for this kind of book. I flew around the world for decades on business. People like me think we know everything, and often we do. But the stories we would tell would scare the bejesus out of a first-time traveler. Not a good idea.And to be sure, the book has some unexpected nuggets of wisdom, like the need to wear compression socks to avoid vascular problems on long flights. This surprised me, since I've never known anyone to suffer such problems, but the CDC does in fact have a substantial write-up on this. Herein lies the main value of the book: conveying tidbits of valuable information that may be just what you need to avoid flying disasters. These tidbits will be different for everyone. Just one may save you a THOUSAND times the cost of this book.The book is sensibly organized into the following sections:Buying the Ticket11 Things To Know About FlyingSeveral Weeks BeforeThe Week BeforeThe Day BeforeParkingThe AirportTSABoardingFlyingLost Bags and Item TheftPacking ListThe treatment is generally light-hearted and humorous. However, the book is meant to convey information, and information tends to be dry and generic. I think Lynette might, in a second edition, do a bit more to characterize the information with personal anecdotes from her own experience. We remember facts better when they come in the form of stories, and stories help to maintain a humorous tone.Although the book is intended as a reference, it has one flaw in this respect: there are few links to further information. Many people will want to drill down to more details on specific problems, so links and footnoting help in any reference guide.While the book is directed at first-time flyers, I'm not sure how many such people are still out there, at least of the people who would be buying this book. However, there are many of us who may be experienced traveling by ourselves but who find that we must escort others who are inexperienced, or where the situations simply go outside our experience.I would include in this group adults traveling with children and adults escorting senior citizens (who may be attuned more to the 1970's than the 2010's). Addressing the needs of such travelers in specific sections of the book would improve its value. There's plenty of room in this book for expansion.It is also true that air travel is increasingly used by people who have special considerations and need special treatment. To name a few: parents with autistic children, vets experiencing serious PTSD symptoms, seniors with dementia, people who have mobility problems requiring the use of wheelchairs or prosthetics, etc. Perhaps such special needs populations can be covered in later editions. We owe it to everyone to make travel as accessible as possible.One value of a first edition can be that it opens a conversation between Lynnette and her audience on both special considerations as well as tips she might not have thought of. A blog, for instance, would be a good way to do this (and it works much better than Amazon reviews in this respect). I've already conveyed some things privately. They're the sorts of things that would make many people blush, but they involve the real concerns of real people. When Lynn addresses in greater detail the things we are too scared to ask about, then we will have a winner.My rating is four stars at this moment because I can see a multitude of ways to improve what is a fine beginning. It's a beginning, though. If this beginning initiates an open process that extends and refines the material, and makes it more personalized and accessible, then that fifth star will be added.By the way, I now loathe air travel and have avoided it for the last 12 years. Planes have become uncomfortable cattlecars, and the TSA has conspired to make the experience at the terminal about as miserable as possible. If you want to enjoy traveling, take the train. It's more fun. If you just can't avoid flying, buy this book. $2.99 is cheap if it reduces the misery of air travel even a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q85UBLSK8AHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J17SF8M#wasThisHelpful","R3Q85UBLSK8AHM","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is a nootropic, that is, it helps with cognitive and memory functions. Each capsule contains 300 mg of alpha-GPC and 100 mg of phosphatidylserine (PS). The manufacturer recommends two capsules a day before 4 p.m.; that's pretty standard for all alpha-GPC products, and over the last four years I've tried most of the major ones. The manufacturer also says you might be able to go up to six capsules a day; that's on the high side although I've seen (and tried) recommendations to use four per day for the first month.I started buying this formulation from Amazon on a subscription basis because that's the most economical way for me to get alpha-GPC, which is pretty generic. Does this particular formulation work? To cut to the chase, yes. Explaining how it works and what more you might do requires much more explanation, though.Alpha-GPC is the real thing in that it definitely boosts those parts of the brain involving memory and cognition although you are most likely to notice the effects during activities like mindfulness meditation or intense focus on work tasks. On the bottle, Doctor's Best also claims that their product may help with stress and facilitate ""growth factor action""; these are dubious claims that unnecessarily gild the lily (and also ignore that fact that too much alpha-GPC may make stress worse).I tend to classify my experience in the following way when it comes to nootropics:1. Acetylcholine (ACh) enhancers. Doctor's Best Natural Brain Enhancers, and Alpha-GPC in general, falls into this class of nootropics. ACh is a key neurotransmitter that can facilitate both memory and cognition. Alpha-GPC gives a sharp boost to ACh, much more than something like choline bitarate. Much of the research into palliatives for dementia and Alzheimer's focus on this line of inquiry. I settled long ago on a strategy that uses anti-cholinesterase agents to maintain ACh levels combined with choline-related supplements to also boost those levels. Combining Huperzine-A and alpha-GPC (or Doctor's Best) is one example of such a combination. Donepezil is an effective substitute for Huperzine but available only by prescription.2. Hippocampal supplements. Magnesium l-threonate may (according to research) help significantly with the long-term memory functions of the hippocampus. I've used it but find it still pretty pricey. Zinc might also help here but can rapidly cause cramping if you aren't careful.3.  Vasodillators. Some vasodillators that act on the brain are showing a lot of promise as well with memory and cognition, and they have the virtue of complementing rather than conflicting with the ACh enhancers. A good example of a vasodillator is vinpocetane although use early in the day may cause nausea. Ginkgo biloba is purportedly helpful in this respect, but the research evidence is mixed.Amazon carries products in all of these classes, and if you're serious about cognitive and memory enhancement, you might find it worthwhile to try products in each class (many of which are available by subscription).As an aside to my above points, I should explain that I don't really care about the PS in the Doctor's Best formulation and doubt that it has much value (for me, anyway). The FDA has reviewed the available research and concluded that there is no scientific basis to believe that PS helps with cognition and memory for the general population (although it may have more specialized uses in sports nutrition and with ADHD). I agree with the FDA.Both memory and cognition benefit the most from these supplements when we're taking steps to exercise both. The brain is similar to a muscle in that respect. You wouldn't expect to become a great runner watching daytime TV. And your cognitive and memory functions aren't going to benefit much from that either.Which brain exercises work the best is very individual. For my part, I complement my use of nootropics with meditative exercises based loosely on Buddhist practices. I also use psychoacoustic soundtracks in the gamma and theta ranges. More recently I've begun experimenting with the MindPlace Procyon mind machine.One warning with nootropics, at least those involving ACh: they can lead to agitation, irritability, and insomnia if you overuse them or take them late in the day. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) will counteract this up to a point, since it has anti-cholinergic properties. Ultimately, though, you may just have to wait it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4LFZVAVGTC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00309ZDHS#wasThisHelpful","RL4LFZVAVGTC2","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea if this eyepiece would work out on my D7000, but it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. By now, I've used it for about 2,000 shots and am presently inclined to go back to the standard Nikon eyepiece. While there are other similar eyepieces on the market, I suspect that they have the same design problems as this one, plus they cost more.This eyepiece does in fact provide nice coverage around the eye that can help to reduce extraneous light. The rubber portion pivots fairly easily around a plastic bracket so that you can adjust the eyepiece for either the left or right eye.However, the bracket is not very secure. I've had it fall off at odd moments, causing me to retrace my steps to find it. My use of a wrist strap probably makes this problem worse for me than it might be some some people.The biggest problem for serious shooters, however, is that this eyepiece, and probably all others like it, have a tendency to obscure part of the frame. I like to know exactly what is in my frame, and I like to know it fast. This eyepiece slows me down. I can work my eye around to doublecheck the framing, but this is slow and imprecise.So there are trade offs with this accessory. They might be worth accepting to some people, but anyone committed to careful framing will find this deal worth foregoing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9OY4MSEZXZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MLAT78#wasThisHelpful","R1O9OY4MSEZXZM","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this costing me under $4, I was sure this was going to be a waste of time and money. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is genuinely a bargain, fairly well made and a lot more handy than the standard neck strap. I put it on a Nikon D7000 and liked it so much that I bought a second one for a D200.The strap screws to the tripod mount on the bottom of the camera. The connection at this end is very secure. It is necessary to unscrew the strap to get access to the battery, but this operation is much less laborious than I expected. The top part of the strap passes through the eyelet on the side of the camera. I thought it might have a tendency to come loose or part company entirely with the eyelet, but after 2,000 shots and no problems, I have a lot more confidence in the strap.In point of fact, this strap makes it much easier to move around in framing shots, since I can easily hold the camera securely with one hand. No more chest banging from trying to use a neck strap.Construction is fairly sound. I had expected the stitching to be coming loose by now, but it hasn't. It also takes up minimal space. I can still get the D7000 into a Case Logic holster without difficulty. And of course, the strap has a certain cool factor, since people even more amateur than me look at the strap and conclude that I must know what I'm doing. All this, and for less than $4.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Y5OLOGCPXU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069R7FFQ#wasThisHelpful","R36Y5OLOGCPXU9","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many other bargain hunters, my immediate response to the D7100's release was to buy a deeply discounted D7000. Then I searched for something to complement the user's manual. Based on the many glowing reviews, I thought that this was the ideal complement. I was wrong.This book's strength is in the professional advice it provides on menu setup and use of the camera controls. That goes beyond Nikon's user manual and is welcome. However, the advice often drifts into chattiness that becomes overly familiar and distracting. The author also attempts what become inane excursions into the deep Nikon past with references to what ""your grandpa"" might or might not have thought The only point seems to be to display the author's long experience with Nikon.The book is also strong in its discussion of the various menu options, but in fact the book does little more in this area than Nikon's user manual, and I can download the Nikon manual into iBooks for $0.Where this book is very weak is in its organization and prioritization of topics. Fully the first 60 percent of the book is on the camera's menuing system. Rather than highlighting those areas likely to be important to a shooter, and leaving the less important topics for later discussion, the author just marches relentlessly through each menu option in sequence, one right after the other, whether or not the menu option has any importance to the majority of shooters.This approach creates anomalies that were frustrating to me in my efforts to take the camera out and start shooting. For instance, there is no section early on that discusses what the various control dials, knobs, and buttons do. The author does eventually have a chapter on the exposure mode dial, but this is in the second half of the book and after an exhaustive discussion of the retouching menu. Since when did post-production come before shooting?There are other examples of such anomalies. For instance, if I want to learn the proper use of the bracketing button, I have to delve deeply into that part of the book that discusses bracketing menu options. The book basically tends to subordinate a discussion of camera controls, and actual shooting operations, to its preoccupation with menus. It has the look of a hurried rehash of the user manual to get something out on the street for enthusiastic users.  It is not a book you will want to live with for very long, though.If you are willing to be patient and search throughout the book for the information you need, then you will eventually find it in this volume. On the Kindle version at least, the table of contents and index won't be as helpful as you might think, so you may have to spend some time searching. If you want something that places an emphasis on getting you out there and shooting, then you are better off looking elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNGLQI1UA1JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EI86JU#wasThisHelpful","R2VNGLQI1UA1JQ","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not exactly a Sinatra wannabe. That would be my father. Still. I really liked Sinatra and remember his movies and music with great fondness. I recently started buying hats suitable for dressier occasions. My Stacy Adams homburg is a little too dressy, however, so I began looking at trilbys.If you don't already know, trilbys are sort of crushable fedoras but with a lower crown and a narrower brim snapped down in the front but up in the back. They became popular for the wealthier crowd at British race tracks (and possibly the seedier crowd at American ones). Their popularity peaked around 1960 and has declined since. I think hats are coming back into style. We'll see.I'm generally pleased with this trilby and would rate it at 4.5 stars for quality, five for value. The Sinatra brand has turned out to be better than I expected with respect to materials, design, and construction. I rated my homburg at only four stars.Here are some more detailed notes:1. Value. I paid about $55 with shipping. That's a bargain for a well-made, lined fedora-type hat.2. Material. My homburg is made of hard wool felt that has a somewhat rough texture. This hat is made of soft wool felt with a finer feel to it. While rabbit hair felt is the traditional material for a trilby, I have hats of this material and would be hard pressed to pick that as any better than this. I can't really tell the difference.3. Lining and finishing. The lining is very nicely done and has a luxuriant look. The band appears to be grosgrain. The sweatband is ample and very supple leather.4. Construction. The stitching and boxing of the hat are very sound. I can find nothing to fault.5. Sizing. I wear a medium. The sizing was exact.6. Style. The styling is correct for a trilby. Although gray would certainly be very stylish, I chose black. The orange trim referred to in the description is on the inside lining. FYI, brown trilbys were the tradition for the British crowd. Because of the narrow brim, the hat appears smaller than I had expected and it will take some adjusting to get the clothing combinations right.7. NOTE ON THE BRIM: a trilby must be worn with the brim snapped down in front. For shipping, this hat arrived with the front brim up. Snap it down to get the proper look.I bought this through Headchange on Amazon Marketplace. This company deserves a special note of appreciation. They changed an order slightly to meet my specifications, got the hat to me ahead of the delivery window, gave me a promo code for future purchases, and packed the hat more securely than others I received. These people are serious about doing business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUW8GMRK00OI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045QD6B0#wasThisHelpful","RUW8GMRK00OI8","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this partly because my pink Himalayan sea salt, while fine for cooking, has a tendency to coat my fingers when I pinch it to spread on food. Salt flakes sounded like a better idea.I was right. These salt flakes are more coarse, perhaps a bit larger than sesame seeds but certainly not on the level of corn flakes. They taste fine, have a very nice texture while pinching, and give a delightful crunch when chewed. It's tough to argue with all this.The container has a certain dclass air about it and would be right at home in a French bistro, so you might not feel a need to get a salt box. One would be advisable anyway, just in case, since box can't easily be used as a dispenser once it starts to empty out significantly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Y0YAQXVXWMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00017028M#wasThisHelpful","R12Y0YAQXVXWMH","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this on a whim as table salt for the odd occasion. The label on the jar advises that this product is good for sushi, fish, grilled chicken, and steak. The salt itself is very tasty, a bit less sharp than my pink Himalayan sea salt. I think the black lava helps to moderate the flavor. It may also scare the bejesus out of the kids but impress guests with your gourmet sensibilities.In general you should consider getting a salt box, but that isn't necessary in this case. The small plastic jar is very presentable and nicely placed on all but the fanciest tables. And unless everyone at the table knows exactly what it what, the label will help to identify this is salt. Your guests will probably appreciate the coaching.The grind, by the way, is neither fine nor very fine. It is somewhat coarser but much less so than rock salt. Black sesame seeds would be of comparable size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEP74BYZIB7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K6X8KI#wasThisHelpful","R1OEP74BYZIB7N","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've found yourself looking at homburgs, then you may fancy yourself to be Al Pacino in The Godfather. I may be the exception to this rule. I needed a formal hat to wear to Mass with a black suit and a black overcoat. Homburgs were once very popular for this type of purpose, at least until the 1960's. Churchill used to wear one. So did Eisenhower at his 1952 inauguration.I'm generally pleased with this homburg and would rate it at about four stars for quality, five for value. Stacy Adams is a good general brand, but I own other hats of greater quality with respect to materials, design, and construction. Here are some more detailed notes:1. Value. I've seen this hat listed at $120 and sold on the Internet for $96. $50-60 is more typical. I paid $36 with shipping. That's a bargain.2. Material. A homburg, like the bowler, is traditionally made of hard felt. This model is indeed of hard wool felt. The texture is a bit on the rough side, as anyone who has handled fur felt would realize if they picked up this hat.3. Lining and finishing. The lining is decent enough but nothing luxurious. The band is indeed grosgrain. The sweatband is thin leather.4. Construction. The stitching and boxing of the hat are sound although I think the lining on the brims could have been more finely stitched.5. Sizing. I wear a medium. The sizing was exact.6. Style. The styling is correct for a homburg. Although black has tended to be the favorite color since 1960, I chose gray with a black band as the more stylish choice.This hat is more than you need for a costume party and pretty good for most occasions. Only very discerning onlookers will be able to tell that it was inexpensive. For Mass, weddings, and the like, it is very workable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUK4MDAF2A8LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKB7J1C#wasThisHelpful","RUK4MDAF2A8LU","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been wavering between giving these four or five stars. In the end, anything less than five would be plain unfair. These are well-engineered and constructed tuning mechanisms that were easy to install on my Takemine acoustic electric. The operation is smooth and precise but takes some practice.Some further details may be helpful to anyone seriously interested in using these:1. Installation. You will need a 1/2 inch head on a socket wrench and a small Philips screwdriver. I thought I was going to be using a micro driver, but the amount of torque required made something bigger a necessity. Replacing the existing Takemine mechanisms didn't take more than 15 minutes. The Planet Waves ones simply slid into the existing holes. Even the screw holes lined up.2. Stringing. These mechanisms are designed with a screw clamp for the strings. Line the marking on each peg to face the bridge, nest the string with some degree of slack (for winding), tighten the thumbscrew, and tune. The mechanism snips off the excess string within half a turn of the peg.3. Operation. The 18:1 gearing makes the tuning very smooth, precise and stable. It really puts the standard Takemine pegs to shame (at least on the less expensive lines).4. Build quality. Very high. These are very solidly built pegs with a brilliant chrome finish.Would I buy these again? Absolutely. Do they improve the tuning? Yes! Would I put them on other types of guitars? Well, I'm considering retrofitting a Stratocaster with PW's 6 in line model. Amazon has these at a fairly economical price for this kind of quality, and I had every reason to think these mechanisms will outlive the guitar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI37JLRFWT6S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E2NBI#wasThisHelpful","RI37JLRFWT6S1","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty good supplement for facilitating long-term memory, but it is by no means a silver billet. As with others here, I've been interested in l-threonate because of the studies showing promise in the use of this supplement to improve memory, which it does by crossing the blood-brain barrier and boosting levels of magnesium in the hippocampus. Other forms of magnesium can't do this.I've used so-called nootropics for the past three years to enhance memory and cognition. The effects are real and can sometimes be profound.  My efforts have  involved a lot of experimentation that eventually led me to use a strategy comprising a number of elements:1. Hippocampal supplements. Both zinc and magnesium l-threonate can help significantly with the long-term memory functions of the hippocampus. I take both. The latter is still pretty pricey, as those buying the Jarrow formulation clearly know. You'll probably find the effects of these supplements to be fairly subtle. Memory, in particular, benefits from being used. You may get the best results if you also use standard memory exercises. Pills don't do everything all by themselves.2.  Acetylcholine enhancers. ACh is a key neurotransmitter that can facilitate both memory and cognition. Much of the research into palliatives for dementia and Alzheimer's focus on this line of inquiry. I settled long ago on a strategy that uses anti-cholinesterase agents to maintain ACh levels combined with choline-related supplements to also boost those levels. Combining Huperzine-A and alpha-GPC is one example of such a combination. Donepezil is an effective substitute for Huperzine but available only by prescription. And now it's clear to me that DMAE is an effective substitute for alpha-GPC. Its effects are a bit more mild, though, which is just as well--alpha-GPC can spike ACh levels and cause anxiety and insomnia.3.  Vasodillators. Some vasodillators that act on the brain are showing a lot of promise as well with memory and cognition, and they have the virtue of complementing rather than conflicting with the ACh enhancers. Two good examples are ginkgo biloba and vinpocetane. I've had very good results with both. The ginkgo biloba works better earlier in the day, since the vinpocetane can sometimes lead to nausea.There are other things you can do as well. At the very least, though, DMAE would be a modest and economical beginning. Since Amazon also offers Source Naturals Huperzine-A at a reasonable price, you might consider that as a second and complementary supplement. L-threonate would not be my primary approach but I find it useful as a way to support the other things.Source Naturals also produces this supplement as Magtein. In the past, Amazon has been pretty aggressive in its pricing of SN products. For this reason, I am monitoring the SN Magtein offering in hopes of finding a better deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JU92AJGW73V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007LEO4Y6#wasThisHelpful","R37JU92AJGW73V","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After months of diligently crushing peppercorns with my mortar and pestle, it dawned on me that there might be alternatives. No, I don't mean the chrome-plated froo-froo inner party grinders we once dreamed of. I meant a real production grinder, but preferably hand-powered. I'm not planning on feeding the Armed Forces.This is a step in that direction. For the price, it's a terrific addition to my kitchen. And the elongated handle with a solid grip makes it a much more efficient way to grind pepper than the more typical twist grinders.This grinder is not an absolutely great grinder for a couple of reasons. The peppercorn tray, for instance, cannot be removed and filled as a bin. This means that filling the grinder can be a bit awkward. I usually spill a number of peppercorns. The plastic part holding the peppercorns in can in fact be removed, but not as a container, just for cleaning.In addition, the fine/coarse grind selector, while helpful, is not engineered up to Oxo's usual standards. I find it a bit loose and inaccurate so far as getting the grind right.Last, the grinder has a snap-on plastic bottom cap to keep the ground pepper fragments in. I'm not sure I see a good way around this design, but it still feels less elegant than Oxo's usual fare.But none of this really detracts in the end from the fact that this is a very nice utensil. I would definitely make this purchase again.

"It's fun to be a food snob. It's even more fun to be a cheap food snob and to amaze your friends and family with your apparent gourmet sensibilities while spending next to nothing. Salt is tailor made for this role.As anyone who has read Mark Kurlansky's history of salt knows, salt is all over the place. You don't actually have to rely on sending your neighbor to the salt mines, either, although that is certainly a time-honored tradition. The price of salt is largely a function of transportation, packaging, and how much either merchants or the government can get away with through taxes or marketing.This is pretty good salt. I'm not giving it the highest rating because the salt is too finely ground to be as convenient as I would like. Spooning it out for cooking is ok, but pinching it for a dish means coating my fingers with salt. And you have to use a salt box. A shaker, which is decidedly gauche anyway, will just drizzle this salt out no end. As is typical with sea salt, a little goes a lot further than typical table salt, which is more granular but not as sharp in taste.Since the salt is pink, it has impurities. Sorry. They're harmless. People lusted after white salt for millennia to avoid this, and now we pay extra. Go figure. I plan on buying black Hawaiian salt next. The confusion at the dinner table will be priceless. Also, I'm pretty sure this salt isn't iodized. If you aren't taking a multivitamin, you might reconsider. I hear gout isn't fun.I originally bought a one pound pack of this, figuring I was a single person and how fast could it go? That was a mistake. It was smaller and goes faster than I thought.

"This case has honestly worked out better for my HTC One V phone than I really expected. I started looking at it originally because the JKase cases everyone seemed to be buying were a combination of overpriced and out of stock. So I got this instead.I had three major objectives in buying this case: spend as little as possible, be unobtrusive, and protect the phone. This case accomplishes those objectives. It is an entirely dull piece of molded gel that has holes in the right places. It feels nice, with a pleasant nonslip grip. I haven't trying testing it by dropping the phone, but the skin is thick enough to protect the phone from waist high drops. Shipping is fast. It must be working well in general because I don't notice it.Would I buy this again? Yes. Is it a style statement? I hope not. Are there better forms of protection?

"I've tried just about everything to compensate for the fact that I lost a small part of my left index fingertip 40 years ago. It makes pressing down on top of a guitar string more difficult. Cutting tips off dishwashing gloves hasn't worked. The rubber tips for sewing or sorting paper don't work. These are the closest I've been able to come to a really good solution.These tips are thicker at the ends and thinner on the sides. This gives them a surprisingly good feel. They are pretty snug, so there's no slipping. I have a much better feel for the strings through the rubber than I had expected. They basically make it a lot easier to play the guitar and open up things like fretboard fingering that I had avoided previously.I am a guy who usually wears large gloves. This particular size worked just right for me, but I urge you to check the sizing chart on the Gorilla Tips web site. That way you can make sure.In the old days,  would have given these five stars.

"I bought this hat six years ago. It wasn't from Amazon but another company whose name rhymes with bats in the belfry. That would be neither here nor there, but you can save a little money, about 20 percent, if you go to this other vendor (I just checked).Anyway, I wore this hat for 3-4 years, then stopped, then started wearing it again. Just today, as a matter of fact. First thing I walk out the apartment door and Rose spots the hat and tells me how wonderful it is and how much better it looks than all my other hats. Rose is 93. She used to be a professional ballroom dancer and probably dated the real Indiana Jones. And she's a lot sharper than people I know half her age.Rose is from an era and the era has spoken. This hat is definitely one to get if you want a classy fedora. Beng able to showboat like Indy also helps, but remember that Harrison Ford exercised a lot of style sense when he got the original from a London hatter 30 years ago. The hat is great regardless of the movie.If you're an astute shopper, you probably realize that there are much cheaper Indy-style hats that can be purchased.Why not? There aren't overwhelmingly strong reasons to spend the additional money on this hat, but I can tell you why it costs more.First, the name Indiana Jones has been licensed, which gives you a little more assurance that the hat is modeled exactly on the movie.Also, the hat is made of fur pelt. This is nowhere near as pricey as beaver pelt (and honestly, you should leave the beavers alone), but it is definitely more expensive than wool-based felt or canvas safari hats. The fur in my opinion looks good and wears very well, but I would be hard pressed to justify the additional cost over good wool.Last, the hat is lined. This really does make a difference in how the hat feels to me, since it seems a bit cooler with less heat build-up. It also makes a big difference in how the hat looks although only the hat check girl will know that you really are a gentleman and not a bum.If you are into fine hats, then this really is one worth having.

"There's just no way I'm going to give five stars to a piece of rubber. That's what this is. It doesn't even look quite as good as the picture, largely because the guitar picks laying on the top help a lot to dress it up. Without those picks, it's just black molded flab.The damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful. I bought this on a whim and cringed when I opened up the box. But for the last two weeks, it's been propping my Takemine up against a coffee table. The rubber is thick enough and non-skid enough that it keeps the guitar in place. Effortlessly. It may not be much to look at, but it works really well.The top portion that rests on a table surface is about 1/4 inch think. There's a nub in the front hat pushes up against the corner of he surface and fixes the rest in place. That's about 5/8 inch thick. The cost of materials is probably not more than 50 cents, but it's the design that sells this thing.If you can find this for less at a local shop, go for it.  I paid Amazon $6.

"Having written more than my share of five-star reviews, I think I should explain up front why you should take five-star reviews with a grain of salt, but why I'm giving these strings five stars anyway.Amazon reviewers typically fall into three classes, the wildly enthusiastic, the downright nasty, and the largely indifferent souls who wrote a review only because Amazon sent so many nagging emails about writing reviews. I've been guilty of all three things. If you read my previous reviews, please keep that in mind.You should also realize that many of the people who get the cute little badges about being top reviewers have often (but not always) stacked the deck by shamelessly going after votes (the techniques for this are endless). Some also write reviews so incessantly for products no one really cares about that Amazon bumps them up in the ratings. It's pretty tawdry, especially considering that no one I know even cares.You should buy these strings because of the G string. That's the third string up, including when you're doing open-G tuning, which is what you should be using if you're playing blues. The reason this G string is better, not worse, is because it's NOT wound. Other reviewers have complained that this makes it a bit harder to keep in tune. Pfftt! If you play blues, then you need to buy a fretboard map and learn fingering notes and scales. A lot of guitarists stop with chords. That's a big mistake. Fingering and scales are what give us riffs, and a wound G string (no lewd jokes here!) doesn't work as well for the sliding and fingering involved.Anyway, an unwound G string is standard rock style. This is just how the program goes.These strings are bronze, sort of. The wound strings are wound in bronze. The unwound strings are steel, so basically the bottom three strings on this set are shiny silver steel. There really isn't much point to wondering whether you might get a better tone from phosphor bronze, zinc bronze (which is what these are), or rock-style nickel wound. Except for bass and rhythm, you're not supposed to be playing those wound strings that much anyway.So...these really are great strings. This is all I'm buying now for my Takemine acoustic electric. They play well, feel good, and sound fine. They are, as the description says, ideal for rock and blues style playing. And Ernie Ball makes good stuff. If it makes a difference, Ernie Ball is what Keith Richards uses. And if you want to play like Keith, lose your 6th string (the one on the top) and tune to open-G. The gauge on these strings is even close to what Richards uses, but he does use nickel wound. He's an electric guy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19RR9M0UNIIW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002DV6TO#wasThisHelpful","R19RR9M0UNIIW0","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love these cards. I wait for people to return them to Amazon, and then I scoop them up cheap through the Amazon Warehouse. They're a great bargain.But after some 400 reviews, you probably figured you didn't need to read another one. And if I really wanted to get your attention, I would give this one star, and a lot of people would read the review figuring that I'm either pretty honest or just very nasty.This product is genuinely excellent. If you know what you're buying, then you can't go wrong. But there's the rub. DO you know what you're buying? I thought I did when I started buying these things. I found out that I didn't, so I'm writing this review not to tell you how great this product is but to help you understand what the hell all the letters and numbers mean.First off, SD cards come in different sizes. A regular size SD card works in cameras and Blu-ray players, some of which require these cards to operate BD-Live. There's another size called micro. Micro SD cards work in cell phones. This is a micro size card. Some of the micro cards come with adapters, in which case you can probably use them in cameras and Blu-Ray players as well. But it's best to get the right size, something I forgot when I bought this particular card. It was for a Blu-Ray player, but I ended up sticking it in a cell phone (it did have an adapter, but I tend to avoid adapter, since they seem like a kludge).Also, these cards come in SDHC and SDXC. The HD means high capacity, 8-32 GB. The XC means extended capacity, more than 32 GB. That's all. That X won't get you fancier performance.Card classes are a whole nother world. Chips perform at different speeds. Class 4 is 4 MB/sec, good for full-motion video. Class 6 is 6 MB/sec, HD video. Class 10 specs should now be obvious. The price differences have become minimal, so if you have a newer device you should probably get Class 10. I would consider 6 if the price is low enough. But usually it isn't worth it.These days, buying an 8 GB chip is just a way of announcing you're cheap. They really don't store that much by today's standards. I buy minimum 16 GB chips, which seem practically free compared to 6 years ago. 32GB is good if you're storing a lot of files on your phone.

"Usually I will only review items I bought on Amazon. This hat I bought five years ago before Amazon carried the product line. I have a couple of reasons for introducing this now.But first, women love this hat! Forget about what I might think personally. Women come up to me in places like supermarkets and compliment the hat, just out of the blue. No one ever compliments my other hats like this, not even my much more expensive Indiana Jones hat. But they love his hat. Unfortunately, the interest seems to stop there, and they don't ask me out.The hat itself has stood up pretty well to five years of use, so for the price it's a good deal. It's not a highly finished hat and doesn't have either a liner or chinstrap, but both would be obtrusive.My first specific reason for writing has to do with deals. A well-known company whose name rhymes with bats in the belfry is putting these hats on clearance at half what you might see on Amazon. Check these things out, you might get a real bargain.Second, you will probably find after a couple of years that the crown of the hat is crumpling and the hat looked pretty, well, squashed. This happened to mine. I used spray starch on the inside, a hair dryer to heat up the leather on both sides, and crumpled newspaper to stuff into the hat to help it keep its shape. Then I waited a day. The hat regained its shape. A wipe down with leather conditioner completed the process.By the way, if you're tempted to spend more to get one of these hats with crocodile or kangaroo leather, don't bother. The regular leather is just as good. Save your money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FA35OZPFU8TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PTJPVU#wasThisHelpful","R3FA35OZPFU8TI","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this as a quick and inexpensive way to cook up stir fry. The skillet cost me $15 through the Amazon Warehouse, so it seemed like Lodge and Amazon were practically begging me to buy it.The skillet works extremely well for its intended purpose. It does take a little getting used to, though, in that washing it with detergent would take off the preseasoning. I'm not overly concerned about this--reseasoning a skillet requires no more than a coating of Crisco in an oven at 350 for an hour. But I don't want to be doing it overly much. In the end, I've found that scrubbing out the pan with plain hot water and a synthetic pad or brush will do the trick.Did I mention that this skillet is HEAVY? I'm 190 and in relatively good shape, and the skillet can still be a bear to handle. Using two hands (there's a handle on both ends) is safest. Try one hand only if you're trying to show off. The elderly or less strong will have difficulty with this pan. My girlfriend, a 55 yo RN, can't handle it.But if you don't mind the heft and have the storage space, it's a great pan to have around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQPEPLUA2YGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006JSUB#wasThisHelpful","RQQPEPLUA2YGX","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this in December for about $90. A friend got it on an Amazon lightning sale for $70. Radio Shack has knocked it down to $50 at points. This is a very good choice if you want an entry-level smartphone with a decent set of features and mostly acceptable performance. If you have more money to spend, in the $100-200 range, you might check out the HTC Evo instead (right now Virgin has it for $150). Above that, try looking at the Samsung Galaxy SII (which I've seen for as little as $225 on Boost). These pricier phones will give you better performance and bigger screens with HD resolution.But if you're dipping your toe in the smartphone water, this is a fine choice. Some additional observations:1. This comes with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. The current version is 4.1/4.2 Jelly Bean, but HTC will probably not upgrade the OS on this phone due to RAM restrictions. And 5.0 Key Lime Pie will be out in the spring. These new systems are not absolute musts, but I do clearly prefer JB on my Nexus 7.2. This phone has a smaller 3.7-3.8 inch screen. I prefer that and have tablets if I really need a big screen experience. You might not like this, though.3. The phone does not support NFC, so you can't use your e-wallet. It's still a bit early to worry about this, but NFC will probably catch on by next summer. So you need to think through just how carefully you want to prepare now. CVS is already installing the equipment to accept e-wallet payments from phones with this capability. But don't worry. Debit cards won't be obsolete for a little while.4. The phone does not support mobile hotspot operation, which is nice if you are carrying tablets.5. The screen is OK for video although I really think you should consider a bigger phone or a tablet if this is a priority. Angry Birds looks fine on it, though. YouTube works pretty well off a wifi connection but stutters on a 3G link.6. Network performance for Virgin on this phone has been adequate for me but nothing special. I can make calls, read email, get CVS and UPS text alerts, and check the news and weather. That's been fine for now. But the 3G networking is clearly not up to zipping along. If you're in a locale with a lot of public wifi hotspots (e.g., Long Island), you might be able to hop from one to the other. In less metropolitan locales, keep your fingers crossed.7. If you get this phone, invest a little time and money and energy using Google Play to download widgets and active screensavers. Use these to customize your screens to suit yourself. Unlike iOS (which I also use), Android 4+ offers customization opportunities that Apple can't match. In skilled hands, this phone has the potential to make your iPhone friends envious. By the way, while there are ways to purchase through the Amazon Android store on this phone, I've found that it isn't worth the bother. I don't really save anything, and going through the Amazon market makes transferability between my Android devices more problematic.I intend to keep this phone for a year. When the fall 2013 sales heat up, I will replace it with something covering the deficits I mentioned above.PS: If you get this phone, you're also going to need a micro SDHC memory chip. I recommend at least 16 GB. 32 Gb is also OK, and you can always swap it to another phone later. Make sure you get a MICRO chip. Otherwise it won't fit. And get a Class 10 chip, not Class 4 or 6. The performance is better and the additional cost is mnimal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUDNN4UZY1RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087T1S6G#wasThisHelpful","R3OUDNN4UZY1RO","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for $10, which was practically a giveaway. It's still at a very good price and deserves five stars for that.The convenience of the pitcher is also indisputable. It's very easy to fill from a tap (preferably to the side of the filter), and the pitcher holders almost enough for one person for one day. However, the size isn't quite as optimum as I would like, and for more than one person it is probably inadequate. Four stars.Filtering is OK. I can taste some difference in the water, but it's not enough to make me jump and shout. Offhand, it's just enough to get me to buy some more filters to try them out for another year. Be forewarned that initial use of a filter will leave black specks in your water. Uou need to take care to flush the filters first.Overall, this is a buy that I like but don't treasure.

"These bowls deserve five stars for their quality. They are highly functional and practically n destructible. My spaghetti used to slide off my dinner plates. With these bowls I have eliminated the problem.These are not the best value in Corelle pasta bowls, however. I spent $26 to buy four of these. Recently I discovered that Amazon is selling a set of four of these bowls PLUS a two quart big bowl for $20. That's a much better deal.If you're a value shopper, you should check out this alternative.

"After having a number of Pyle-Pro cable-related items fall apart after very light use,  started buying Monoprice. I was paying a bit more and expecting a lot more.

The quality, design, construction of the Monoprice connectors are really much better than you're going to find on cabling in a similar price range. They hold up to more use. The set screws don't fall out nexpected lay.For home studio use and practice jamming, these are a good choice.

"I bought this popcorn as a cheap and convenient treat but did not expect the quality to be as high as premium popcorn. And perhaps it isn't, but I can't tell. I know that it pops efficiently with very few orphans, and the popped kernels are full, fresh, and fluffy. It amounts to a cheap thrill.Bulk popcorn would be cheaper per batch but require the use (and cleaning) of equipment. I got tired of this. As a single person, it's easier for me to just throw a bag into the microwave and nuke it. It takes 2 minutes in an 1100 watt oven.

"At less than $8 this was a very good purchase for a single person who doesn't require a great deal of toilet paper. On price alone, I would give this five stars.The quality is not as good as I recall for Cottenelle, though. In spite of the ultra part of the label, this toilet paper still has the somewhat rougher feel of a budget brand. This corresponds to the reviews I've seen on those sites that devote themselves to such things. In general, Quilted Northern Ultra ranks the highest. Cottenelle Ultra comes out somewhat slightly above average, a B+ grade more than an A grade. I would give this toilet paper no more than 3 1/2 stars for quality.If overall cost is your priority, this is a wise purchase. If quality is your priority and you don't mind 48 rolls at a time, buy Quilted Northern Ultra from Amazon.

"I started wearing reading glasses in November after cataract surgery. I originally bought an inexpensive pair from CVS for $10. It didn't take more than a month for me to realize that I had better start buying more pairs. If I didn't sit on them and break them, hen I was going to mislay them. This happened numerous times each day.I bought these as a backup to give me the additional pairs I needed. As a backup, they serve well enough, and the pricing is very good. I would give them five stars just for the pricing.For comfort and quality, however, they do not compare well to the somewhat more expensive CVS pair. The frame is less comfortable and considerably less well constructed. The focus is OK but not superior. This is to be expected of something costing around $3 per pair.In the end, I have my backup and am satisfied in that respect but will be buying further pairs through my local drugstores. The cost is greater, but not enough so to offset the advantages of trying on and assessing firsthand the quality of something I expect to be wearing quite a bit during the day.

"I've stopped writing reviews for Amazon. After reading some of the other reviewer comments, I decided to make an exception. To be up front, this is not the absolute best hummus that I've tried. That would be what I used to eat when I lived in Cairo, and my own homemade hummus is pretty decent as well. Straight out of the can, this is a fairly good hummus. If you use if as a base and mix in a little imagination, then you should be able to get hummus that can match just about anything else around.This also happens to be a terrific deal at its current pricing of just under $16 for 12 cans. Don't believe me? Check out the pricey supermarket hummus in the teeny plastic containers in the deli section. Right now, this specific offering is a better deal than Amazon's own subscription offering of the same brand of hummus, and the 15 ounce cans are for me a bit more convenient than the 30 ounce cans of the subscription offering.Unaltered, this hummus is a bit more thick and pasty than it should be for an ideal dip. It's also a bit on the bland side. Being bland makes it great as a base, since this opens up the possibilities for some doctoring and personal variations. It also makes it a bit safer for the American palate, since hummus can be an acquired taste and many people who are new to hummus may not want too much in the way of surprises.Anyway, I've found that, while I can eat this straight out of the can, I prefer mixing in some more lemon juice, a bit of water, and tahina. In my opinion, that has to be done to make this a good dish. I also mix in sea salt, crushed peppercorns, and sometimes either chili powder or Louisiana hot sauce. Garlic powder is also a fair addition. In fact, if you like to play around in the kitchen, then I would suggest experimenting to your heart's content. I'm obviously not a hummus purist, if there is such a thing. Hummus is an occasion to celebrate new ideas, whatever we figure we can get away with. To serve with a bit of flair, drizzle a high quality olive oil on the top of the dip and sprinkle black sesame seeds as a garnish.By the way, one reviewer said this product was too lemony. It's really not, and adding more lemon juice helps this to reach the right consistency.Many people would say that the best way to serve this is with pita bread (""esh baladi,"" or people's bread). That IS the traditional way to eat it, but we don't really need to follow tradition that much (as long as you don't spread it on Twinkies). Since I can get Panera day-old baguettes for next to nothing, I just slice these up into chips that can be dipped. There's no need to get too picky about something that is close to street food in the Middle East. If it tastes good, it's appropriate.In the end, with a bit of playing and the proper ingredients, you should be able to make this hummus into your own special dip. Your friends will envy you, and you will have saved a bundle.I don't know how long Amazon is going to keep the pricing at this level. Right now, they're pushing hard to establish their market for Middle Eastern dishes. You might want to lay in a good supply before the inevitable price hike. And in the meantime, enjoy a bit of the Middle East. Boy does this make me wish I could go back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25O6XA49AA3FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P0N328#wasThisHelpful","R25O6XA49AA3FS","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've worked extensively with choline-based cognition enhancers for the past three years. This includes various forms of alpha-GPC as well as time-release formulations of choline bitartrate. I also have considerable experience with formulations which have a similar objective, including things like piracetam as well as cholinesterase inhibitors like Huperzine-A and donepezil. Last, I have a lot of experience in supplementing these with nootropics like vinpocetane, which acts as a vasodillator to improve blood flow to the brain, also improving memory.To recap briefly, choline-based supplements can augment the brain's supply of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical to cognitive and memory functions. They can be used in tandem with cholinesterase inhibitors, which slow the degradation of ACh and keep the overall levels in the brain somewhat higher. Things like piracetam and vinpocetane are not directly related to ACh but can work in tandem with choline-related supplements to further enhance the effects.Inositol is not related to any of this but has benefits of its own, notably as a mild anti-depressant. For that matter, choline is useful in clearing the liver and resolving fatty liver disease, something helpful for recovering alcoholics and those who've simply binged too much. The two together are usually recommended as well as a supplement for anyone on a strict vegetarian diet, since such diets are likely to be lacking in choline and inositol.My slight downgrade in the rating reflects my assessment of this supplement as a cognition enhancer. For general dietary purposes, and especially for recovering alcoholics, it is fine. Taken strictly as a cognition enhancer, though, the following observations may be significant:1. The best combination of choline-related supplements for cognition enhancement is alpha-GPC and Huperzine-A (donepezil is better, but that's by prescription).2. The best single choline supplement is probably alpha-GPC, followed closely by Huperzine-A. Alpha-GPC is much more bio available than other forms of choline. This isn't a myth dreamed up by industry.3. The most effective formulations of choline bitartrate are the time-release formulations such as that from Solaray.4. The least effective formulation of choline bitartrate I have tried, for cognition enhancement, is this one from Source Natural. I'm surprised to be saying this since Source Natural turns out very high quality products, but the results are what they are.As I tried to note above, this is still a very good general dietary supplement, but if your objective is cognition enhancement, there are better alternatives. Unfortunately, those alternatives cost more.By the way, the tablets are in fact bigger than average, as some reviewers have complained. At least they're not as bad as K-Con potassium tablets, which are really huge, but some people will still find them uncomfortable to swallow. I suggest mixing them in with applesauce or yogurt. This will help a lot.I hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBAY5C6GCYBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I4C4OS#wasThisHelpful","R1KBAY5C6GCYBM","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In general, Del Monte canned fruits are of excellent quality deserving of a five-star rating. These peaches are no exception...except for what seem to be persistent problems in Amazon's handling of Del Monte products.I use subscription purchases to get Del Monte peaches and mandarin oranges from Amazon. Of the last four shipments I have received in the last two months, three have been very unhygienic. The cans were dusty and scraped, and they looked like they had been rolling loose on a warehouse floor and then gathered up and repackaged. Cans in one shipment were severely dented almost to the point of rupturing.It's not clear where in the supply chain this problem is occurring. It may be in an Amazon warehouse. Or Del Monte may be selling seconds to Amazon. Either way, the product being delivered to the customer is something I would not choose myself from a supermarket shelf.I've advised Amazon customer service of this problem. You should do the same if this problem occurs. And I will update this review if the problem is resolved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HU44KMIMA4I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045G8KJ8#wasThisHelpful","R3HU44KMIMA4I2","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is very good tahina deserving of a five-star rating. I bought it as an experiment to make sure that I could still prepare proper hummus myself. I had grown very tired of the commercial brands sold in the US, which are geared towards an American palate and are on the bland side for me (I lived in the Middle East for 15 years). Because the unit price of the Al Wadi brand is so much less, however, I expect to be buying that in the future.This tahina is good for up to two quarts of hummus or baba ganoug, depending on your recipe and tastes. It seems to settle, so you may need to stir it before usng to get the proper consistency. You can also mix it with pekmez for a dip, or you can fake this with grape jam (which is cheaper). Baba ganoug is the same thing as hummus but using eggplant instead of garbanzos. You can also use fava beans.Please keep in mind that this is people's food, not haute cuisine. It doesn't have to be served on a silver platter with pita bread (which is ""esh baladi"" or people's bread). I'm cheap. My apartment building distributes free day-old Panera bread, so I slice up baguettes and use that instead to dip into the hummus.And the proper Arabic is ""tahina"", not ""tahini"" (at least in the Egyptian, Najd, and Hijaz dialects). If you say ""tahini"" in Cairo, people will stare at you strangely and tag you as a tourist. Don't get tagged as a tourist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY47FY1PFCSBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R6BJ62#wasThisHelpful","RY47FY1PFCSBU","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not going to bother repeating all the accolades already bestowed on this little gem. They're true. I use ths for hummus and vinaigrettes. It's not absolutely necessary, but it IS a timesaver and labor-saver for a 64 yo cooking for 1-2 people.Instead, I'm going to tell you how to buy this cheaply. Click the link to ""Used"" items. Look for Amazon Warehouse and anything labelled as used but in good or better condition. This invariably means that someone returned it to Amazon and that the packaging is damaged to a greater or lesser degree. The product itself is new. I bought one this way for $33.

"Currently, I can buy a 6-ounce can of jumbo pitted olives at Food Lion for $2.49. These are a bit more expensive per ounce, even on a subscription basis. However, I've weighed a number of factors and just now ordered a second lot of these ahead of schedule. Aside from price, here are the things I considered:1. These are at least as good as any other black olives I have tried.2. The sizing is much more convenient. Using an entire 6-ounce can at once is often not very convenient. Suppose I just need smaller amounts for stir fry or salads? In the end, using one of these cans serves my purposes better and is more economical than the bigger store-bought cans.3. While I can certainly chop whole olives myself, this product saves me the trouble. And there IS a certain elegance to having neatly sliced olives, especially when presentation makes a difference.4. I'm pretty lazy, and it's hot outside.

"I purchased this a year ago and have used it off and on since then. With its red color and Coke logo, it has an undeniable charm that is hard to resist. It's performance, however, is marginal, and I do not regard it as an especially good value. I finally gave it to my son, who I thought might have better uses for it.My offhand observations include the following:1. This unit will keep drinks cool. It is not an effective way to cool drinks off and will do so only very, very slowly.2. The cooler is best used as a mobile unit in cars or trucks. It has a 12-volt connector for this purpose. It also has a built-in carrying grip on the top that is very handy.3. It might also be used in bedrooms or dorm rooms where access to a refrigerator is limited, but it's lack of any real cooling ability will be frustrating in these situations.4. The door latch is poorly designed. I had to slam the door repeatedly to get it to shut properly.5.

"Peanut butter gourmets who enthuse over esoteric brands won't like me for saying this, but Skippy usually bests everything else in taste tests, and Peter Pan often ties Skippy. Don't believe me? Check out the published reviews of tests with 12 year olds, a key consumer population. The Cooking Light website also has some good reviews.I picked this up because it was less expensive than Skippy's alternative. In a straight-up comparison with Skippy's super chunk, I can't taste any significant difference except for the honey-roasted flavor. And that flavor really makes this offering a winner. It is not cloyingly sweet but just flavorful enough to make eating this peanut butter a real treat just by itself.And I do exactly that, especially during my mid-afternoon hypoglycemic periods. This peanut butter will serve well anyone with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes who hits a low-sugar rough patch.Each jar has 13 servings, and each serving has 190 calories, most of which are from fat. This is enough to chase many into the arms of reduced-fat alternatives. OK. Just remember that this fat is mostly monounsaturated and possibly good for you. Removing such oils may undermine the nutritional value.Don't believe me? Again, check the web. I switched away from reduced-fat peanut butter when I realized that it was more politically correct than nutritionally correct. Anyway, I love this stuff, and so long as I eat moderate amounts, there should be no problem. But it's still tempting to get a spoon and eat a whole jar in front of the TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNSRK5HV6N12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002O12YHA#wasThisHelpful","R1HNSRK5HV6N12","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If spreading this solution on and wiping it off could magically remove all the wax, then I would give it five stars. But that is not the case. This solution can be effective, but only if you're willing to spend time and effort in using it. A LOT of effort.I got one unit of this for two small bathrooms and a smallish kitchen. In retrospect, that should have been enough if I had used it with care. I didn't. I poured half into a mop bucket and tried to treat relatively large areas with a sponge mop. While this removed some wax, it still left me with blotchy and soiled floors.So I backed up and used the rest more cautiously in the following manner:1. I put up to one cup of this product in a pitcher with water in 1:2 and 1:3 solutions.2. I then spot-treated up to 10 square feet of linoleum tiles at a time by pouring small amounts of the solution where I needed it.3. I got down on my hands and knees and scrubbed with a very hefty Oxo cleaning brush.4. I scrubbed until I got lots of suds, and then I scrubbed even more. The suds made more of a difference than the strength of the solution.5. I used a scrap hand towel to wipe off and rinse each small section, and then I moved to the next section. I used plenty of water.6. Once things dried, I checked for shiny spots indicating wax, or for really soiled areas, and I repeated the above for up to five times.This approach is effective. A power scrubber would also be effective, but I didn't have one.Aside from wax, this product also does pretty well in cleaning baseboards and dirt on kitchen walls. It takes off scuff marks. It removes general soiling. But this all comes at the cost of considerable time and effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5J8GFNRNVHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BYE9LG#wasThisHelpful","R1X5J8GFNRNVHG","AOINAOO0NQRGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOINAOO0NQRGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty, typically well made Lenox porcelain ornament. It does not look as delicate as in the photo, though, perhaps because it is so large (4 1/2"" from top to bottom and about 3 3/4"" between the widest sides. It is not white, it is ecru (which I like) and while the gold pattern and red jewels are very noticeable, the green blends in with the center decoration. I didn't mind that, but if someone is looking for a Christmas ornament with a lot of red and green on it, this wouldn't be it.  (It also doesn't have the year on it, if that matters to you. I actually prefer it without that, so this new style worked for me.)The ""arms"" of the snowflake are wider and heavier-looking in person than the way the photo shows them, which makes sense for porcelain, but might be disappointing if you expect it to be very delicate. I like the lattice-y ness of it.  This is a large and unique-looking ornament. It would go well on a tree with many,many different ornament styles or, alternatively, an all porcelain or all snowflake-type tree. I have mostly glass balls and things that look a lot a like, so I'm planning to hang this as a household decoration for Christmas. .I may also get one for Chinese friends who celebrate Christmas as, to me, as with the red and gold box it makes a nice gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZFGOJZFKDTC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNJSJI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZFGOJZFKDTC0","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was hoping the landscape view stand would work (as it hasn't with every other case I've ordered except one that was plaid and so ugly I couldn't bear to use it, practical though it was).  Unfortunately, the landscape view doesn't support the Fire well enough with this case either. Other than that, it's lightweight as promised and, personally, I like the bright pink color.

"Such nice warmth when you're cold.This Serta electric mattress pad arrived on my second day with the flu. I had moved to the couch, with a blanket, but was having chills. So ""electric warmth"" sounded so good. I didn't have the energy to read a lot of the booklet, just took a look and plugged it in, using it almost as a heating pad to see if it would take the chill off.The control was so easy to use--you just choose the level of heat that you want, from 1 to 10. The timer is similarly configured--it shows the length of time (in hours or half an hour) that you want it to be on. Even with a slight fever, it was extremely easy to figure out. I kept it low for about a half hour--it was nice and warm, took the chill off--and my blanket-and-couch set up started to feel so much better.The following day I put it over the mattress as it's supposed to be and it fit without no problem as I do not have any thick topper with foam. I don't sleep with it on, but I love being able to warm the sheets before getting into bed. It feels amazing actually--so cozy.  I love the timer and even dual controls if you and a spouse/significant other have different preferences for warmth (as so often is the case).

"My picky cat loves Friskie's Temptations, so I was curious if she would like these or not.The package rattling made her think it was Temptations at first but when she got a whiff of the smell she got even more eager to try them. I put down two of each kind to see if she had a preference, but she just ate from left to right and finished everything. If I was guessing, I think she liked the crunchy ones (Chicken and Turkey) better and generally preferred the chicken over the salmon.  But she ate everything.She's a small cat--runt of the litter--so I did consult the chart that Irresistibles puts on the Product page to see how many pieces a day she should be having (about 14 a day = 10% of her calories in treats).There's real meat in these and no artificial flavors. I liked having the Variety Pack which had four flavors --: White Meat Chicken (soft), Salmon (soft), White Meat Chicken & Turkey (crunchy) and Salmon & Ocean Whitefish (crunchy).  At first I thought the two salmon were identical, but you can see the crunchy one mixed with whitefish. As I say, I think she preferred that and the crunchy chicken and turkey over the soft ones, but she did it them all, and very quickly.They do use BHA as a preservative and titanium dioxide for the color, but thatdidn't really bother me. Not crazy about Red 40 or Yellow 6 (is it really necessary? I think pet owners could accept grey-colored treats if they knew they were better for the cats. They also use corn gluten meal, which doesn't bother me, but might be avoided by others, so FYI.  Overall, I thought they were a success although all natural Temptations may still have the edge most of the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20MWKT15N80VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0114CE4MM#wasThisHelpful","R20MWKT15N80VW","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a lot to like about this, starting with the fact I always prefer to use glass for hot drinks for health reasons--not having the bad chemicals leeching from heated paper cups. And the flavor is much better than in paper or in stainless steel (ceramic's not good for you either) . At home I have glass mugs, but getting a drink outside you usually have do without it. This solves that problem really well.  It's also always nice to bring your own container to coffee shops so that I know I'm not adding to more trash problem. It's sad to see how much trash one coffee shop creates in a single day.Anyway, I like the glass (borosilicate) container and it handles heat very well, as promised. I poured boiling water in, steeped my tea and carried it immediately. The foam sleeve around it was not cool to the touch--it was warm actually--but very comfortable. (Actually, it was a cold day and the container--which has a slight ""give"" nicely warmed my hands. A bonus.) . It comes in a variety of colors but I really liked this plum shade--not boring like black and not loud like green or orange. The foam sleeve also covers the bottom of the mug to help prevent slipping. It has a convenient handle on top, like a thermos. The foam sleeve provides a comfortable grip and helps with heat retention, but it is not a thermos. The drink stays hot-to-warm for the time it would normally take to drink it slowly. It's not something you would travel far with and expect to keep hot for an hour or more.The cap screws off and on easily, but you have to be careful to line it up correctly or there might be some leaking, as with any thermos. The cap is made of BPA/BPS-free polypropylene (PP#5) with no phthalates, PVC, or polycarbonates.  It is designed to minimize spillage--so its  concave all around, and the opening that you sip through is recessed and flows a small amount at a time. This was the only thing I wasn't that crazy about. It makes sense design-wise, is even a good idea (and makes it difficult to burn yourself by drinking something hot too fast), but its a little more difficult/slow to drink from this than other thermos-type containers.You can wash the sleeve and glass together and it is all dishwasher safe, but not for use in a microwave..","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11W7DROAABAEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161KQ4PM#wasThisHelpful","R11W7DROAABAEM","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I thought it might be too large..or too small...or look tacky with the snowman, but I really like it. It is heavier than I expected and that, plus the beautiful finish, gives it a very 'quality"" feel. The snowman is cute, head about the size of a tangerine and the candy dish is the perfect size to me--small enough to keep filled easily (people who said a bag of MnMs mean the large bag--that's just about right), but not taking up too much space on the table--really the perfect size, about 6"" across.

"Heads up for anyone who doesn't sight read the bass clef well.This  ""piano solo"" sheet music is all written for double bass clef. No treble clef at all!  It is a low song--I didn't realize it played the melody in the octave below middle ""C"".  I thought it sounded fine transcribing to start on the ""B"" below middle C, but apparently the actual sheet music  starts (as written in the bass clef) goes down as low as D sharp...  So, even if you wanted to accompany yourself (and I just wanted the melody line), you're looking at two bass clefs and no treble clef at all.Speaking for myself, if you're not that good at sight-reading, it is very difficult to play two bass clefs.

"I normally prefer dark chocolate, but I was very happy to get this Nestls Cailler L'Ecorce in milk chocolate instead. I know they also make dark chocolate bars (a couple of kinds) but, good as European chocolate is, the dark chocolate from Europe--usually with at least 80% cocoa--is just too bitter for me.I did ""ding"" them one star for making it seem like this is a small swiss company that makes the chocolate at home (from milk from grass-fed, grazing cows, not factory farming) and they roast the hazelnuts themselves as well. That may all be true (except the ""home"" part; Cailler has been around since 1819), but it's part of Nestls.  Not exactly like mom and pop making chocolate from their  farm which is the impression the literature gave me.Anyway, the chocolate tastes good, there are lots of finely chopped hazelnuts in it and each bite has some hazelnut texture and taste. It's not super creamy as a result, and milder in terms of sweetness.Because it's milk chocolate, with the sweetness, crunch and smoothness, Even though the bar is very thin, about 1/2-1/3 the thickness of a typical Nestls or Cadbury bar in the market.

"A well-done adaptation, directed by Joseph Sternberg on a low budget.  Peter Lorre is a fine actor--as is Edward Arnold--but is a bit miscast as Roskolnikov. This is a crime story that about so much more than murder.My one objection is to the Product Description. ""A Great Masterpiece becomes an even greater movie!"" Really, who writes and approves copy like that? Dostoyevsky's novel IS a masterpiece and one of the best things about this movie is that it will get more people to read the book. But it is an insult to a competent movie to pretend that it in anyway achieves equivalence--much less superiority--with such a deep, complex and beautifully written book--something that is -truly- a masterpiece..

"I know there are so many benefits of fish oil but it is difficult to get them through diet alone. When I've tried Omega 3 supplements in the past, there was an unpleasant after-taste, even if mild.  These fish oil gel caps have a lemon coating so if you have any burping or aftertaste (I couldn't detect any) it will not be fishy. These have the usual benefits of Omega 3 for heart and circulatory health, as well as improving immunities. Zenwise claims they also ""boost energy and regulate mood""--which would be another great benefit although I haven't noticed it yet (still early)They have 2400mg of Omega 3 fatty acids which boosts heart health, plus 880mg of EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid, an anti-inflammatory) and 600mg of DHA which is good for the brain, heart and eyesI like that the capsules are made in the U.S. and are FDA regulated. What I like even more is that they are cruelty free and sustainable.They are also gluten free and avoid many ingredients that cause allergies--there's no wheat, egg, milk, peanut or soyThere's even a  ""no questions asked"" money back guarantee.

"I've bought a lot of Anne Klein watches because they are well designed, versatile and have that extra removable link in the bracelet that really helps if your wrist is small. This has a larger face than other AK watches I've had--about as large as a 50 cent piece.It's a pretty watch, and I liked it more than I expected, because the crystals aren't trying to seem like diamonds. The crystals around the outside are under the glass, add a subtle textured sparkle--nice, not too much. The mother of pearl finish on the face of the watch gives it a bit more ecru color than bright white--which I like and think looks classier than white would have.It is easy to read (no numbers on the dial, but lines that are clear, like a little sunburst.The watch keeps time well, as expected, and even has a second hand which many watches don't have anymore. The bracelet part is just a typical shiny gold colored (not matte) band.  I was looking forward to the two bracelets but didn't find them particularly worthwhile to use. They hang loosely (annoying for me), are oval and don't really add anything to the watch or work well on their own, at least not  on my wrist. I thought the watch looked a lot better without them.So, in my opinion, the price really would just be for the watch alone wihich makes it a little  more expensive ($25 or so) than my usual AK watches that don't come with bracelets.. Is it still worth it? I think so. But I've noticed since it arrived that Amazon frequently discounts the price to between $110 to $135. If it were me, I'd  wait till it dropped a bit before buying.

"This is the first product I've tried from Prepworks by Progressive and I'm a fan!  I have had opened bags of brown sugar wind up hard and unusable more times than I care to remember. This product is such a clever solution for that. It's a good shape, clear to see what's in it if you forget, and a convenient size--can store 2 lbs of sugar with no problem and some room to spare. There is a silicon strip around the inside rim of the lid for a tight seal and, on top of that, the front latch snaps easily and securely into place. But the creative part that is so innovative is the terra cotta disc that comes wrapped separately. There is a whole sheet of colorful product labeling that comes with it but none of it has any instructions! Instead it says, ""look under the lid"". Well, my lid didn't come with any instructions so I don't know why they couldn't write the simple directions on that big colorful product sheet.Anyway, the direction is this: unpack the terra cotta disc, cover it in water (it will hiss as it absorbs the moisture) and after 10 minutes or so, take it out and snap it into the space in the lid. It goes in very easily, but tightly, and doesn't fall out. They say it's also fine to put the terra cotta disc directly into the sugar and leave it there, but I prefer it inside the lid where it provides some moisture. The sugar really does stay loose and fresh.

"I'm a big fan of Turbo Tax. I used to pay way too much to have my (fairly simple) taxes professionally prepared because I had no confidence in my ability to do them.  Turbo Tax is truly ""user friendly"". The way it leads you through every category in such a clear, easy-to-read-and-follow way is fantastic. It really does eliminate all lthe stress (until that ""pay up"" part) and has also made me understand the process--and the information I need to save throughout the year.  It has been helpful in every way.However, what motivated me to write a review was that this year I made a mistake. Someone in the household bought Turbo Tax on disc before April 15, but then we asked for an extension. When it came time to file in the fall, the only thing left at Amazon was the PC download. I ordered it, not realizing that there was already TurboTax  software on my computer. $100 is a lot of money to throw away, so I called Amazon almost immediately.  They sent me the confirmation email and told me TurboTax has a guaranteed refund (I think within 30 days of purchase).I wasn't optimistic, but I emailed the information (took under 2 minutes to do it) and--to my surprise--in a few weeks, there was the refund check! No muss, no fuss. That is so impressive. And...really appreciated.  What a great business model. So I wanted to post here and say that they really do stand behind that offer if for some reason you're dissatisfied with the program (yes, you do need to uninstall it first, of course).  It's great software, though, but nice to know if you make a mistake as I did, you're not out the money.

"Mine were shipped and arrived without the crumbs that others complained of. They are nice round raspberry-colored balls, about the size of a cheetohs puff, bigger than popcorn and dense inside, not hollow.They are very crunchy--which I liked. I also liked the flavor a lot--it is a little sweet, and a bit tart (possibly a little too tart for many young children who would otherwise enjoy the crunchy snack). You taste the Fuji apple more than the raspberry. (Apples are the first ingredient, then raspberries then pectin and juice concentrate--nothing else.

"I liked using this program. As a photographer, I like to use photo editors for more than fixing the photo problemscropping, sharpening, adjusting hue, etc. If you primarily want to adjust your photosfixing them as photos including adding some color enhancements--there are several other very good, much less expensive programs like Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop Elements that do that.This is a pretty expensive program and I wouldnt get it unless I felt it did something that I couldnt do less expensively elsewhere (or couldnt do at all elsewhere) or unless it made something much easier to do than a less expensive program did.Painter 2016 doesnt make thing easierthe interface isnt horrible and the tutorials are goodbut it is not all that intuitive and takes a little patience. (I also found some of the Youtube videos helpful). If youve used Photoshop, etc. youll see a lot of the same concepts herethe layout of the workspace, the toolbox, palettes, brushes. You can use layers and adding one is just as easy as clicking New layer.What I like is taking a photo and using it to make something that is less like a photo and more like a painting (obviously those who start from scratch can use the tools to create a drawing or painting from scratch. The dpi is good.) The cloning tool and tracing features are very useful. It will do underpainting for you automatically. You can choose the texture of your paper and between all the things youd expecta watercolor effect, pastel effect, charcoal, etc. Choosing the right brush is a big thing in Painter, but it isn't that hard to get used to.  In addition to the texture of your paper, you can control the brightness of it and  adjust the texture to customize it for your own needs. It was good for landscapes,  okay for portraits. There are some special effects filters, wood cut, kaleidoscope, glass distortion, and so onnot useful for me, but someone may like it.If you want to make art, particularly from a photo, this is a good program for it. I found the graphic capabilities able to add the kind of artistic details that made the end product look more like something that had started out as a painting done from scratch rather than a digitally enhanced photo. If you understand what that means and want to do it with your photos (and have the time to do it--it's not like applying a filter, it's like actually making a work of art), you would probably enjoy this very much.

"In the old days, it would have been laughable to think that you needed an entire book to use a telephone. But, times change, and today what we call a ""phone"" is really a hand-held computer that can make calls. The little computer we rely on and carry everywhere is a highly sophisticated and incredibly versatile tool. Books like ""Android Phones for Dummies"" remind you just how complicated and versatile a tool a ""smartphone"" is--and how few of us really bother to learn all the incredibly useful things that it can do for us.This is another well designed, well written ""Dummies"" book (really for smart people because despite the easy writing style and occasional bits of humor that mark this series, there is an awful lot to know and it takes patience to read through the directions and try them out). This book starts with the basics--making it a good book for anyone getting a smartphone (Android one) for the first time.But the best use is for someone who's had the phone for a while, does some of the basics already, but wants to know what all it can do--and how to quickly do it.  There's the phone basics, of course, voice mail, texting, etc., plus using maps, taking photos/videos, playing music, using a variety of apps.  Part IV then gets into customizing, working with apps, various other navigation and utilization instructions where you're doing things, not hard really, but thing that most people probably just don't know about.It winds up with the section of tips: ""Ten Tips, Tricks and Shortcuts and ""Ten Things to Remember"".  (The first thing I read in this book was actually the last page of that section--and, though randomly selected, it was very useful--how to take a screenshot. Didn't know it before, do now, in just a paragraph.. The tips in these two sections alone would make the price of the book worthwhile).You can start at Chapter One for the concepts and set up and go forward to keep building on what you know. Or just jump around to the things you know you want to do and skip the rest. Either way, this book is well explained, well illustrated and a fount of information.

"This is a well made microphone, heavy, about 6"" long and very professional looking. (So professional that it looks a little funny using it to take smartphone videos, but... why not? Kind of ups the ""smartphone game"", at least that's what I was hoping.) The cable between the mic and the smartphone is about 6' long, about the right length as you might even want someone else to hold the microphone a ttime.Things I like? I really like the quality of the construction--as good as my $200 microphone. I also really like that it is an EXR mic--fits on my near-professional Panasonic digicam perfectly (although it cautions that it is ""only for mobile devices"". I've never seen a mobile device that allowed for an EXR cable, but they must be out there). In addition, the EXR has an adapter for the built in mic jack in smartphones and tablets--easy to put on, fits perfectly and is obviously the.way most people will be using it.It comes with an attachment that you can use with a mic stand. It also comes with a small black vinyl carrying case--about 6"" long--fits the microphone but if you want your mic jack, you have to take it off before storing them together in it. It's compact and convenient.The mic jack is standard size-- 3.5 mm (1/8) jack, so it fits into pretty much all mobile devices. Mine had no problem fitting into a phone and two tablets, a laptop, etc. (Again, there is an important warning not to use it with a standard XLR cable--it is only for mobile devices so I'm not sure why it is made for an EXR cable to begin with.)The manufacturer claims that it has both omni and cardioid patterns--so it can be directional for a speaker or general noise recording for an entire room, for example. I was unable to accomplish this change no matter what I tried.  (The page of directions is only about the obvious things--connecting the audio jack adapter, nothing technical or to help with troubleshooting.)  The recessed switch was hard to reach and didn't seem to do anything, despite the claim that it switched between omni and cardioid settings and also raised or lower the gain. None of that worked, as far as I could see.When you use the mic jack you are often taking up the same jack that your headphones would have used--and I really really like that this has a split cable with its own jack that lets you plug your headphones in while using the microphone. That's a great feature.If only it worked well. :(  It did not work at all with my Android smartphone (BLU) but did work after I downloaded this app for the Kindle Fire. It definitely amplified the sound and improved vocal quality considerably. But the problem was that no matter what I did (and you can adjust it by sticking something into the Hi/Lo switch) the background sound was like you were at the ocean. Right at the shore a constant and loud ""Whoosh"".  If I find a solution, I'll reevaluate this and post what it is.

"It was great to use these in a lot of ways. They worked well with the computer wirelessly or with an audio jack. But, of course, the real test was how they would work with PS4.At first, it was hard to figure out how to get them to work wirelesly with the PS4. There were no instructions, but basically you put the USB wireless adapter in, push and hold the Power button on the side of the headphones,, Go to ""Settings"" and choose ""Output to headphones"". Sound from ""Metal Gear"" transferred to the headphones,  leaving the room silent (much appreciated by others in the household).  The game playing experience was greatly improved . The helicopter sounded like you were really there--completely different from playing through the tv. Music, sound effects, speech--everything immediately sounded different and so much better.  I asked my friendly neighborhood gamer to try it and his first response was ""It's amazing how much better this sounds!""The bass mode is not overpowering and added a nice depth of sound, especially compared with other headphones we've tried where the bass often overpowers you. I know someone else complained the fit was a little too small and might be good ""for kids"". That was not our experience.  I think kids--not too little--wouldn't have a problem, but for two different adults these were not at all small, even on the smallest adjustment. If anything, I could have made them a little smaller--if possible--but it wasn't a problem. They are adjustable so my feeling would be that they would fit the vast majority of people fine. We also found them very comfortable (and the blue light on either side looks very good).The only slight drawback was that, as others have noted, mine had a slight hum in the right ear in wireless mode--no problem at all if its not wireless--the buzz is noticeable when the game is silent, not when there is any noise. It didn't really bother me but, in fairness, I did drop off a star because -- not quite perfect. Otherwise, it was very much a ""5 star"" experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7BXPSV144XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016K12406#wasThisHelpful","R1C7BXPSV144XN","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a small Vornado that only works at close range. I like it for what it is, but a heater that is designed for an entire room is much more useful. Like the smaller one, you can choose between two heat settings or use the fan. I really -really- like that you can set a timer to turn off automatically, as it is also used by a relative who could easily forget that its on. Also, for that same reason, it is nice to have a remote control so heat can be controlled even if you're bedridden (permanently or just for a bout of flu). That probably seems a small thing, but I love the option of not getting up to turn something off, especially late at night. As ""heating requirements"" are different in my household--and central heating wastes so much heat and electricity for those who don't need it while they are sleeping--this individual room unit is really great here.  It is small, easy to move or store and provides a nice, even heat.  Again, given the variety of people using it, I appreciate that it will automatically turn off if someone knocks it over or something inadvertently blocks the vent and there's no risk of anyone burning himself from touching it, even the grill isn't metal .The Vornado is compact, safe and easy to use, not a fire hazard, works well to heat a room and is very convenient with its remote control and timer. I definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y7RHXJBZO45X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVF0HYA#wasThisHelpful","R2Y7RHXJBZO45X","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two months ago,I paid $50 for Corel After Shot 2 alone.  It's included free with PaintShop Pro X8 Ultimate, so, seriously, how can you go wrong with this program?  I had a little difficulty with installation but that was, I'm convinced, the fault of the laptop (Toshiba with Windows 10--not my favorite). The supplemental dvd (with After Shot 2 and Perfect Effects 9.5 on it installed right away. (Perfect Effects, by the way, gives you lots of customizable filters and a choice of presets. I haven't done much with Perfect Effects, but I mention it for someone starting out, it would be a real confidence-builder as you see how quickly and easily your photos can be improved.) . I had to try a couple of times with the main dvd  for PaintShop, but as I say--laptop problem as the third time everything installed just fine. I mention it in case you have the same experience--the discs are fine, don't give up.This is a great program for working with photographs (and, as I say, a really good value). It has all the usual things that others do--red eye correction, face-recognition, cropping, geo-tagging, etc. One difference is with RAW. I've been trying to use RAW more (actually RAW+JPEG) and really appreciate the ease of converting RAW photos here. No, it's not super fast, but like all Corel products I've used, it's user friendly and reliable. Plus, there are such benefits of keeping a RAW file while editing your photos that I'm a believer in any software that makes it easy to do. There is also batch processing, selection tools are better and everything works--not super fast, but faster.There is a lot to like about this software.  If you've used other photo editors, you'll feel comfortable with the layout and interface, even though ""layers"" are a little bit different, the concept is the same. (And if you haven't used Photoshop, being introduced to layers here will make you feel more up-to-speed if you ever take on Photoshop).I'm especially a fan of Corel since they still make it possible to buy this versatile photo editing software as a disc--I am really sad and sorry to see Adobe take Photoshop to a subscription.  Corel gives you the features you'll need at a fraction of the Photoshop price--similar to PS Elements, but with added features--and puts it all still within your control by disc (no internet connection if you don't want, ever) on your own computer. All in all, this is an affordable program with all the editing tools most photo enthusiasts will ever use or want--including the ability to easily convert and work with your RAW images, a  big advantage right there, imo, that Photoshop doesn't even have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMGAE30C3LB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60D8#wasThisHelpful","RIMGAE30C3LB5","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An epilator isn't ""pain free"" and this one was no exception. However, it is very helpful that you can use it in the shower--at the end, with some soap, its bearable, like a lot of bee stings with some redness that faded quickly.Apart from the pain (this isn't a razor), it charged fast and I like the color (the box, on the other hand, has kind of a weird vibe, but...who keeps the box?)  I didn't find the alternate head useful or the trimmer, which was too aggressive, but others may.  I like the grip--very comfortable and easy to hold onto in the shower.

"I am always happy when I can say my cat liked something. She isn't a big eater and doesn't need a weight loss food--I worry more that she's so finicky and doesn't eat enough--but she really seemed to be looking forward to this as soon as I opened the bag. I think it has a strong fishy aroma because she actually followed me to the kitchen as I brought in the bag and then, to my amazement, got up on her back legs to get closer as I opened it. She is -never- excited about food (only about Temptations cat treats). I poured the kibble onto the plate and she practically was running into the room with me. Unbelievable!Anyway, there must be something very enticing about this. She didn't finish every piece of food (very small pellet size) but she never does--and she did eat most of it, didn't just sniff and walk away (per usual). So that was actually very exciting--a food she's enthusiastic about.  (Her excitement wore off in a couple of days, but at least she'll still eat it with her usual, ""Is this the best you've got for me?"" attitude.)The price at $20 a bag is pretty expensive, although I think it could last a while--no way would she eat more than half a cup a day, about 160 calories--so if its at all affordable, who wouldn't want to give their cat a kibble where the #1 ingredient is ""Atlantic Pollock fresh caught from the Bering Sea""?  I aslo like that it is grain-free and gluten-free--no corn, wheat or soy (common allergens for cats)--and includes good, healthy fats like olive, canola and salmon oils.This is particularly designed for weight control (330 calories a cup), an issue that would have helped my two previous cats, but not the current one. At 12, she is just fussy and its more of an issue to get her to eat enough of anything--kibble or canned food--or to keep her interested in any food she seemed to have liked yesterday. So it's always a complete unknown how any food is going to work -- or how long she will like it.  I'm very impressed by this Solid Gold product because she's never acted like this before. I'll post more if the novelty wears off, but so far, except for the price, it seems like a very good choice with many benefits, including for an older cat like mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TJ7PTDOEQIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTKQG#wasThisHelpful","R1TJ7PTDOEQIU","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I initially received this through Amazon Vine, it is a product I look forward to buying more when it becomes available again . Recommended use is in spring, before the summer drought conditions come to the states where it is available for sale. But I got it in the middle of summer, in the middle of California's five year drought, so hardly ideal testing conditions.  (It is only available in states with these kinds of severe water problems: AZ, CA, CO, FL, KS, NM, NV, OR, TX, UTNevertheless, I tried it, liked it and feel that it worked. I applied most of the container to the front yard (a slight hill, so runoff can be a problem--the reason I chose that location). It was easy to shake the pellets across the lawn by holding a handful of them at a time. It says be careful of your eyes, but I had no issues. Scotts says these are safe for vegetables and animals so that was important, too.We are restricted to watering twice a week now and the grass was looking pretty bad. The soil is not a clay-type, but is hard and I liked the idea that this product was designed to force water deeper into the soil and at the same time reduce water needs by 2/3s.There is no real way to measure how much water one is saving because our use is already so restricted that many things are just dying. However, after three weeks--still no rain, no clouds--the front yard was looking greener, even I could say a bit more lush, than it had the previous month. Since nothing else had changed, water-wise, I do attribute the difference to Scotts--and under less than ideal conditions. We are expecting heavy rains this fall and spring, and I plan to use this next year before the start of summer as even El Nino isn't going to fix our drought for 2016 and I really do think this product helped considerably, as intended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWLQBAGWDZAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010872WBE#wasThisHelpful","RFWLQBAGWDZAD","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I asked someone if he liked it. He studied it critically for a moment. ""Is it real?"" then ""Was it expensive?"" I understood the questions came because this pretty necklace does look prettier and more expensive in person than in the picture. I was surprised how pretty it was, actually. It is quite delicate--not only the thin chain (which is a little hard to fasten with the small clasp--my only complaint)--but the pendant itself which I found much prettier, more delicate and more like fine jewelry in person. The gold plating to me looks like real gold jewelry and the topaz are pale sky blue, but not clear, just enough color and sparkle to go with an outfit in a tasteful way.

"I don't envy people who develop food for cats. They are such picky eaters! Even when they like something, they often don't like it for very long. That's how my cat is--picky, picky, picky!So it's always great to try new food in the hope--hope!--that this will be the magic one that she'll love and eat forever.  At first glance, the Nutro food looked promising. Unlike another reviewer, I thought it smelled perfectly fine (in all three flavors--turkey; chicken and tuna and salmon).  It's called ""sliced"" but is actually ""minced"" which I thought might make it even more appealing (it didn't). They are all in ""savory sauce"", but in all but the turkey, it didn't seem so much ""saucy"" as ""not dry"". The turkey actually had some broth, although of course you get more actual food the other way. (I say this as someone who is forced to buy the Fancy Feast Broths for my cat-- $1.79 each for a packet with a teaspoon of food and a lot of liquid. So these little 3 oz cans--about the size of the CANNED Fancy Feast--which my cat also won't eat--seemed like very good portions by comparison).I couldn't read the microscopic list of ingredients even with reading glasses, so I got help. For the turkey, in order, they are: turkey broth, turkey, turkey liver, pork broth, egg product, natural flavors, minerals (about 30), xanthan gum, and taurine. It uses NO grain. So...very good ingredients. They should let you see them.I liked that these flavors are especially made for cats who ""like chunks of meat in sauce"" and are designed ""with tender meaty pieces that are easy for cats to pick up with their tongues"".  Sounded perfect for my cat but...alas...she lapped up a little here and there (preferred the chicken & tuna, then the turkey and last the salmon), but most of it remained on the plate (luckily the crows love it).  I'm going to try again, leaving it for her overnight which may work better.Since cats are so individual in their tastes, and since--like other Nutro pet foods we've tried--is a very good product, I would recommend trying one of each flavor in the hope that at least one would ""be a hit"".  It could happen and I think it's worth the effort (and price).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FV7AMSPBEFE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEIQ0AU#wasThisHelpful","R2FV7AMSPBEFE4","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Things I liked a lot: the selections, including ""Sway"" which you don't find that often in these jazz play-alongs and which has a nice bossa nova beat. There's a mix of slow, medium and fast songs which is nice when you're learning or mixing practice level to skill level.Of course, the concept itself is great--four different lead sheets for each song--for B-flat, E-flat, C, and Bass clef instruments--to play along with the track on the CD.I also like the full CD arrangements with the melody track, very nice and it sounds good when you play along with it.  The Table of Contents is a little confusing at first. Basically there are two arrangements for each song--two tracks each. (1) Split Track/Melody -- Woodwind, brass, keyboard and mallet players can play along with this.  Bass players can play along by removing the bass track by turning the left channel off.  Keyboard and guitar players can perform with it by tuning the piano off with the right channel.(2) Full Stereo track -- this is a rhythm section for soloists or groups.What I didn't like:  (I think of myself as a ""high beginner"" so please take that into account for the following. It's possible that my skill level (or lack thereof) makes a difference here):I don't ""get"" the stereo track. To me, it sounds completely unrelated to the music.  Similarly, there's a section of every Split/Melody track that has rhythm only, no melody and it seems completely useless as accompaniment if you're trying to play along.  Possibly this is a fault of the CD player, although I also tried it on the computer which definitely had two channels. I wish they didn't put that part in the middle on the melody track.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YXIU0BFFX8A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423459105#wasThisHelpful","R2YXIU0BFFX8A5","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The current SAT will be administered until January 2016 and then will be replaced by this new one. It is completely redesigned, with big changes and a new stated philosophy. After taking one of the 8 practices in this book, if I were in high school, I would quickly take the current SAT and not wait for this new one. However, if that's not an option, I'd definitely get this book. This is very different from the old SAT test. The new one tries to eliminate any advantage from memorizing things in advance (like vocabulary) and aims at testing higher level thinking skills in all areas as much as possible. Practice with the format--lots of it--will help.This is the first new SAT design since 2005 and reflects a new philosophy at the College Board which designs it.  Students are no longer asked vocabulary words in isolation but in the context of 400-750 word reading passages. (This is not as easy as one might think. For example, in one of the Kaplan practice passages, the word ""casual"" was used in a sentence to describe the ""observer"" and you were given four choices for its meaning in that story--""careless, occasional, comfortable, or relaxed"" . I chose ""careless""--secondary meaning of it--and still disagree with their ""correct"" choice. However, they made a case for it, and I understood better how to decide between two possibilities in the future. These practices really do help you quickly narrow it down to the two best choices and eliminate one. (The correct answer, by the way, was ""occasional"").The Old SAT had: 3 Critical Reading sections 20-25 minutes each 3 Math sections 10-25 minutes each 3 Writing sections 10 - 25 minutes each 1 Essay test (25 minutes) 5 answer choices for multiple-choice questions 'The New SAT has:' Reading: 1 65-minute Evidence-Based Reading section' Language:  1 35-minute Evidence-Based Language and Writing section' Math -- 55-minute section with calculator' Math -- 25-minute section without calculator' 1 Essay test (optional) - 50 minutes' 4 answer choices for multiple choice questionsOn the pre-2016 SAT, the highest possible score is 2400, The New SAT is going back to a highest score of 1600, with the essay an additional separate score.The changes are dramatic as you can see by the list above, and they say to ""expect an increased emphasis on critical thinking, problem solving, and data analysis."".I think these Kaplan practices did an excellent job of capturing the feeling of this SAT and helping a student get used to practicing the various ways of extracting information from the reading (whether in the reading test itself, or language or math) and applying it. I really like the way they gave the answers--categorizing them as ""easy, medium, hard"", explaining the skill needed, and often elaborating on why the answer was correct. I didn't expect to miss any at my age, but I did, and as I worked through the problems, I had a better understanding why I had missed them. Taking all 8 practice tests would definitely be helpful--not only did I improve from the first to the second but, more important, I felt more comfortable with the format after finishing the first one. Eight practices would be useful.Whether it's math, language or reading comprehension, you have to be a great reader for this new SAT, so practices like this are be very important.  That's why I'd recommend LOTS of practice, to build up those reading skills, improve note-taking ability and working back and forth from the questions to the information. (Also to prevent your eyes glazing over from the sheer number of words everywhere. This is nothing, if not tedious, and maintaining concentration in three hours of reading and answering gets tough).Reading.  In the reading passages (which now are ALL longer, 450-700 words), everything is about understanding a passage or line in the context of the overall meaning of the article. There's also a new kind of question, that has you support your previous answer by reading four different passages from the article and choosing the one that supports your answer to the previous question. On the one hand, this can help you catch a mistake with your previous answer when you can't find support for it. (That happened for me once) But it's also pretty word-heavy, sophisticated reading skill even at my age and I think most of the time, people won't catch mistakes, but will just make a second one, by choosing the wrong supporting statement for the wrong previous answer, thereby doubling their mistakes.  Again, practice helps.Language:  There are no more ""obscure"" vocabulary words tested in isolation. Now they're all in the context of sentences and passages that require more interpretation and understanding.  Worse, in my opinion, is that writing is now tested as part of ""Writing and Language"", rather than through the essay. This isn't really testing your ""writing"", to me, it is testing ""editing"". You are (again) given paragraphs or passages to read and then asked about word choices, whether a grammatical structure works or needs changing, what stylistic change would improve it, etc.This requires reading through four fairly long phrases of possible answers and then going back to the original and re-reading the paragraph. Again, being able to keep up one's concentration is very important. If you're not a good reader, or start getting tired, I could see the mountain of words in all three skills tested--reading, writing and math--getting overwhelming at some point and leading to a lot of guessing.Math.  In the old SAT you could use a calculator throughout with the math.  Now they've limited the use of a calculator. There's one 20 minute section with a calculator--and one without. (Here's one of the ""without"" questions that Coleman gave as an example: "" The gas mileage for Peters car is 21 miles per gallon when the car travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The cars gas tank has 17 gallons of gas at the beginning of a trip. If Peters car travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, which of the following functions f models the number of gallons of gas remaining in the tank t hours after the trip begins?"")Coleman explained why there's been the shift away from calculators: ""The math section will focus on data analysis and real world problem-solving, algebra and some more advanced math concepts -- areas that most prepare students for college and career.""  He added, ""No longer will it be good enough to focus on tricks and trying to eliminate answer choices. We are not interested in students just picking an answer, but justifying their answers.""  That gives you some idea of what this is like.Many of the math questions are multi-step solutions embedded in a lengthy paragraph. In addition to being very wordy, the math sections (both with and without calculators) are very visual. There are many graphs and diagrams to interpret in order to answer the questions and often a selection of formulas to choose from as the correct way to set up the problem. I know I said it before, but there is a LOT of reading, lots of wordiness, on every section of this test.Essay:  The essay is now optional (adding 50 minutes to the 3 hour test if you choose to take it)., and will be scored separately. In the old days, it was about the writing itself and your reasoning, not about whether your facts were right.  Now, facts matter and the essay--same question for every test which seems odd--also is scored based on how well you understand and evaluate the writer's argument. If I were a student taking this new SAT, there's no way I would make the essay optional. I'd take it, because this test is difficult.One interesting change is that with the new SAT you will no longer be given a penalty for wrong answers.  It is easy to run out of time, so that's something everyone should know: no blanks! DO guess!There are so many changes but Coleman has an interesting plan for helping students prepare. The College Board is partnering with Khan Academy to offer test preparation free online beginning in spring of 2016 (check for some things that may be uploaded earlier). That is an intentional challenge to Kaplan and other test prep companies because Coleman's stated goal in doing this is to ""remove any unfair advantage that wealthier students have in being able to pay for SAT preparation classes"". That sounds good, and the idea that they're contracting with Khan to offer ""free prep"" might put pressure on the SAT design to be something students can really prepare for, even if it won't require much rote memorization.After going through the Kaplan practice tests I think if I were a student, I'd be practicing all the time for this--with this book, with the other Kaplan book with the 3 full tests, with Khan Academy online....everything. It's not something you would want to take blind--or just cram for with one prep course.

"The 8 songs are classics, among my favorites from Stevie Wonder.  The arrangements were a little disappointing, emphasizing the rhythm on the backing--this isn't like having a combo behind you. It's still fun to practice and play along with--to hear it played at the right speed and learn to keep up. It's easy in concept but challenging for a high beginner. The first track gives you the piano with it, the second one is the backup only. What I really liked was how it looped throughout it more than once, so you really have the chance to ""get it"".The disappointment was just how little of the song is included--for example, I really got it for ""Isn't She Lovely"". It has the lead line and below it a treble and bass easy-ish arrangement, plus the chords noted above and it's in the right key --E major-- even if it is challenging with 4 sharps. However, it only spans two  pages, meaning it's just the first verse, no chorus, none of the interesting bass line. I had to go to Youtube for that but it would have helped to have the complete sheet music. With 8 songs only, I really thought it would have included the full songs at this price, since it isn't like other books in this price range that have arrangements in various keys for several different instruments..","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M0UMPFBG8Q9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161780777X#wasThisHelpful","R2M0UMPFBG8Q9V","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first Nexxus product I've tried and I'm a fan! It did an amazing job smoothing and de-frizzing my fine, color-treated hair.  Of course, it can't ""put back"" hair that isn't there, but for some reason, it just doesn't look as broken and frizzy as before.It must be the ingredients they tout so much--""elastin protein"" and ""marine protein"".  I wasn't sure what ""elastin protein"" was, but it is apparently (per ""WiseGeek""), ""a protein found in the skin and tissue of the body that keeps it supple...Elastin listed as an ingredient in anti-aging skin care products are not from human sources; they typically are harvested from either cows or birds and in theory should promote better skin elasticity.""Similarly, I didn't know what ""marine collagen"" was and found out (same source), that, "" Marine collagen is a material derived from the substance found on fish scales. It has been widely used in Japan for many years as a natural supplement. People who use this substance claim it has various benefits, which include healthier bones and skin."" WiseGeek.com adds, with some relevance to this conditioner, that ""Collagen production is vital to healthy skin, hair, bones and joints.... Often, vitamin makers will put collagen in with vitamins as an extra bonus for skin, hair and nails."" So, seems like a good thing, if you don't mind that cows, birds or fish may have been used to produce it.The conditioner with all these collagens in it, did the job as promised. My fine, thick, wavy, somewhat heat-damaged and frizzy below-shoulder-length hair looked smoother and healthier, much less frizzy and color/sun damaged after I used this a couple of time. (Leave it on for 3 minutes after shampooing then wash it out--no problems with the washing, even though it looks dense coming out of the bottle. You don't need much, even with long hair.)  Nice look, definitely healthier and I like the idea that it can somehow actually ""reinforce the cuticle wall"" and make hair more resistant to breaking. So far, so good!

"Updated: Okay, I really love this airboard. It sounds good and couldn't be any more fun to play. Love the design, the colors of the melodia and the case. I want to give it a full ""5 stars"" but the mouthpiece just doesn't fit. (See below for an inexpensive solution if you have the same problem. After buying the usual mouthpiece and extension tube for it (altogether it cost $6), 20.9"" Length Plastic Flexible Melodica Pianica Tube w Mouthpiece I'm having a blast with this. Wish I could rate it higher than ""4""--I actually prefer the mouthpiece and extension to the bendable mouthpiece this comes with--but, well, shouldn't it be more or less perfect on arrival?  But apart from that one problem, I really do recommend it.*****Original review:  First I ordered the most familiar Hohner melodica, the 32 key one in black (it also comes in blue or red, for a higher price although they are otherwise the same). Hohner 32B Piano-Style Melodica Black_ I tested it with my tuner and the pitch, to my surprise, was near-perfect (tuner showed slight variations, but not enough to register as either a sharp or a flat. Very acceptable). It was fun to play, so much fun that I gave it to someone who wanted one, too (for under $40, it makes a nice gift).When I came to order another, I found this one. It, too, had the same consistent pitch, and the tone. was also very good, just like the black Melodica above. Although this one is more expensive and the description indicates it has a different construction, I felt that playing it--and the sound--were pretty much the same. Possibly the keys on this one have more consistent action, possibly a little smoother, but if that's so it is subtle.I really enjoy the colors--bold and cheerful--and like the boldness of the case as well, I kept this instead of getting another 32B. (And kudos to Hohner for going so bold and colorful. This is not a  conventional look and to me suits the ""feel"" of a fun, street-jazz kind of instrument..Design-wise there were two things that I didn't like, one small and one important. The small one was that the case--which is soft--only unzips on one end and partially around each side, meaning you have to reach in and take the airboard/melodica out. I actually preferred the 32B case that unzips fully on three sides and partially on the fourth, meaning that you can  lay it flat and  open it  as a place to lay your melodica in flat and play it from there, if you wish, using the white extension tube.  The case is roomy at the top, too, about 4""This one doesn't come with a black mouthpiece or the white extension tube. However, on the plus side, it has a nice pouch on the front of the case where you can store things, including the mouthpiece and a tuner--or even a wallet, smartphone, snack or drink.The sound is very good--mostly like a harmonica (but much, much easier to play) with a little accordion thrown in.  I've heard you can bend notes b y partially pushing down a key, but have yet to successfully do it..  .It doesn't come with any documentation , but that's because it is such an easy instrument to learn. Any lead sheet or melody line will work for music, anything in the range that doesn't go below ""F"" below middle ""C"".  I had a lot of Fake books for piano in ""C"" and  they were naturals for it  This is a great instrument to introduce someone to playing music,  and is often used for that in schools in Asia.All in all, this is a very enjoyable instrument, you can play well solo or with others and a great gift as well, either as the airboard or the more traditional looking melodicas in black, blue or red. It's lots of fun..","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WJ7V9R86HK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0YOEC8#wasThisHelpful","R28WJ7V9R86HK3","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw the new ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" debut this week and his band leader, Jon Batiste plays one (check Youtube for clips of him playing a melodica). As soon as I saw it, I had to have one. It just looked so fun and online info made it sound easy and so versatile--a little like a saxophone, a little bit like an accordion--and a lot like a giant harmonica (that is much easier to play).  I've read these sometimes play a little sharp (but still fine), so I was actually surprised to test this inexpensive 32B melodia with my tuner and find that every key was pitch perfect (what variations there were weren't enough to register as a sharp or flat). Really surprised! It sounds great.Despite having a keyboard, the melodica doesn't sound at all like a piano because when you blow into the mouthpiece and press down a key, your breath crosses a reed that vibrates under that key. It's a woodwind that's ""free-reed""--you just blow into it--and the sound is produced like a harmonica which is also considered a free-reed instrument (and, of course, has historically been Hohner's specialty. Hohner also were the ones who developed the melodica, back in the 1950s. Because they have the trademark, the other companies making them--Yamaha, Suzuki, Hammond, etc.--have to call their melodicas something different--a pianica or melodeon, or ""MYlodica"", etc. But they're all the same idea as this, with slightly different designs, and different tones, build quality, action and performance, sometimes--but not always--related to price.) If you like the feeling of hitting piano keys, this is much easier to play than either a harmonica or an accordion. As Lauren Bacall said in the movie ""To Have and Have Not"" (in a different context, but it works), ""You just put your lips together and blow.""The melodica's simplicity is probably why there are no directions with this, nothing at all, except a sturdy padded case with a carrying strap (about 18"" long case) and inside the black mouthpiece (which I greatly prefer) and the white tubing that you can use if you are carrying it, or more commonly, if you put it on the table to play flat while you blow through the tube. That's an easy way to practice, but it looks a little strange. Because there aren't any instructions, I've included the few things that I do know about playing this below.You can regulate the sound (which can be pretty loud--and I like that because beginning an instrument its often difficult to get decent volume). Blowing gently makes it softer which seems obvious, and harder of course makes it louder--and you can vary the dynamics in between more than I expected. Experiment with your breath control to see.  It is a nice single note instrument that can solo or accompany others (guitarists can keep the guitar in their lap and switch back and forth pretty easily).Yes, you can make chords, but personally, I like the single note (or paired notes) sound better for this. JMO. You don't always tongue each note like, for example, with a clarinet, because you'll usually tie a whole phrase together with one breath. But you should try the attack at the beginning of each breath, by seeing whether saying ""two"" or ""do"" or ""who"" gives a better sound for that phrase. Someone said that if you can get a growling breath coming from low in your throat it sounds a bit like a saxophone but I have not been able to do anything like that. Still trying.For sheet music, just find songs that you like where the low note doesn't go below ""F"".  I've found that ""C"" fake books work well--play the melody/lead, adding partial chords here and there as needed.. Simplified classical music works too, if it has a strong melody line.After about 30 minutes, the melodica will have accumulated some saliva so depress the ""spit valve"" at the bottom end, remove the mouthpiece, shake the body gently, and then blow gently while holding the spit valve. I've actually found most moisture is in the mouthpiece so have something handy to shake that into as well . Surprisingly, people who've taken these apart after much use find them very clean inside--nothing like dirt or mold, etc. like you might expect. Maybe whatever residue remains evaporates quickly.Unlike some other melodicas (like Yamaha), Hohner has a hand strap for your left hand. This is very nice to keep it steady. You can also lay it flat on a table or in the case, and use the tube.I also like the Hohner ""Airboard"" (basically the same instrument sound-wise, but very colorful and a little more expensive.)Hohner AIRBOARD32 32-Key Airboard with Bag  All in all, to me, whether you choose the 32B or the similar airboard or a different style altogether, if you like the sound of harmonica and want to get that sound in a very easy and fun way, the melodica is a great choice..","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KMH5HO02NEYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055DCWKS#wasThisHelpful","R2KMH5HO02NEYV","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ET4500 --an ink-jet, not laser, printer--came perfectly packed in Epson's large box--no chance of damage en route. Unpacked, it was a good desk size model--about ... wide and ...deep and ... tall. It looks nice and was easy to move.The set up directions were easy to follow. Do take their advice and wear gloves when pouring in the ink. The 4 bottles come extremely carefully packaged--separately--and open easily by removing the inside foil cover and then just easily popping off the top. I put down plastic as directed but there was ""0"" spillage. However, removing the foil lining, while easy, did get ink on my fingers because there is a residue underneath it if you're not -very- careful. (They warn you about this in the directions, but I was too confident. It wasn't much, but it doesn't wash off.)It is easy to fill the reservoirs--just turn the bottle over. Be sure to put each color in the correct reservoir--cyan, magenta, blue and black. You run the CD in your computer, plug in the printer and it found my wifi network on its own.This might seem a little pricey, except for all that it does. Also, that Epson promises a good savings on the cost of ink. They claim roughly 4000 copies per ""load"" or about the cost of 20 cartridges. The b/w printing was fine. The color as accents were fine. But personally, if I were printing photos, I still think it would be cheaper to do it through Walgreen's etc. Personally, I would print photos in color as kind of ""rough drafts"" to see what I wanted to change before sending them out. But if you want to use it for photos, it does have the color combination to do it and does fine with it.  The copies were good and clean, but if you need double sided, you need to flip the pages (not so bad for a few pages, but if you do that routinely the ET 4550 or other duplex printer would probably be a better choice).I had no problem printing from my computer. I scanned a bill into it without problem and was also able to use the fax without difficulty.  The booklet is clear for what it says, but there's little about troubleshooting. (Just FYI, if you do have a problem, you can download the drivers at the Epson website).All in all, it's a good looking, easy to set up and versatile machine that should also prove economical over time, due to the ink bottles rather than cartridges (and Epson has a recycling number you can call when that time comes).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IABRVOF8CS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","R12IABRVOF8CS4","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The publisher describes this as an ""authorized biography"", which is true, in that the author was a close friend of Gore Vidal's for many years. Vidal was happy about Jay Parini's plan to write this biography and gave him full access to friends and papers and lots of shared conversation and life experiences. But, since it was written and published after Vidal's death (in 2012), it is probably (fortunately) more candid than the word ""authorized"" usually implies. Parini makes a sincere attempt--from the introduction on--to wear both hats--that of a devoted and admiring friend (who saw in Vidal a mentor and a father-figure) and that of an objective biographer who is writing about an important American man-of-letters.The friend usually trumps the biographer, I think, but a lot of that may be for the best (for example, he tells more than enough--but probably not too much, considering the role it plays in his writing--about Vidal's homosexuality. For those who want even more details, he refers you to another book by a different author, ""In Bed with Gore Vidal"". Would that all biographers had that option!)Parini was a Vidal friend, not his lover, and this too is probably a good thing. Because that friendship is such a big subtext here, I was interested how Parini's wife and children don't seem to have contact with Vidal although for others--like Paul Newman's kids, he was a genial ""uncle"" figure. For some reason, I particularly wondered about Parini's wife--did she know him, too? Like him? Not want to spend more time together than necessary? We never know. After all, Vidal does seem like he could be pompous and cold if he didn't like you--too ascerbic, too self-centered ( even often too drunk) and so might not be to everyone's liking, particularly if they're not willing to subsume their interests to his, as I think the author indicates that he was very willing to do, always. It may seem a trivial question, but I think Parini is a protective friend and has left out some of the uncomfortable, unpleasant parts of knowing Gore Vidal for those who didn't make him the center of attention..There were some surprises in this book. For example, on the ""early life"" front, like many, I had assumed Vidal came from an upper class family. That was not, as Parini makes clear, exactly the case. His father was born in small town South Dakota , such a talented athlete that he was recruited by West Point mid-college,. then went on to the Olympics in 1920 and 1924. Later became a pilot (and the great love of Amelia Earhart)  and an aviation pioneer, co-founding three airline companies, including TWA and Eastern, and the Boston and Maine Railroad.--so he -was- wealthy, but as a self-made man (and ""married-into-it"" money), while Gore was growing up. He also had strained relations with his son, several troubled marriages and problems with alcohol--something Vidal seems to have shared.Vidal detested his mother who -was- born into high society. But it was her divorce from Vidal's father and marriage to wealthy Hugh Auchincloss later, that gave Vidal the connection to the Kennedys, since Hugh later remarried again and became Jackie Kennedy's stepfather. Vidal had a testy and increasingly distant relationship with the Kennedys and Parini doesn't quite show quite how obnoxious Vidal could be (for example, he doesn't mention Vidal's derogatory attitude toward JFK's lifelong best friend, Lem Billings, calling him JFK's ""slave"" even making gay slurs about Billings who was, like Vidal, a gay man--but, unlike Vidal, a very very constant and loyal, UNself-centered friend.  Parini does describe one White House dinner party that Vidal attended and I could understand why Bobby Kennedy wanted nothing to do with Vidal afterward. And no, it wasn't because Vidal was gay, although he liked to think so. RFK travelled with Billings who was gay--but, unlike Vidal, at a White House dinner Billings was respectful and socially appropriate.  Bobby Kennedy--like Gore Vidal, I suspect--didn't suffer fools gladly.)Vidal's nastiness toward Billings' as being too subservient to JFK particularly struck me as surprisingly lacking in self-awareness since Vidal seemed to require more acolytes than anyone, whether friends like Parini or his longtime companion (not a monogamous relationship), Howard Austen.  Unequal relationships seemed the name of the game for him.For all his air of erudition and education, it also came as a surprise to me to learn that, after graduating from prep school, Vidal had never gone to college. Instead he went into the army (the setting for his first book, Williwaw).  But he read widely, and deeply about history, and--college or not--was an intellectual and at ease with his well educated peers. His output of fiction was really astonishing, even writing mysteries as ""Edgar Box"", a pulp novel as ""Cameron Kay"", and several teleplays, including the well received ""Visit to a Small Planet"" and, for the stage, ""The Best Man: A Play about Politics"". The latter was also made into an excellent movie, still available on dvd, starring Henry Fonda as a character who was considered modeled on Kennedy, Cliff Robertson as a rival ""Tricky Dick"" type and Lee Tracy as an incumbent president reminiscent of Harry Truman). The Best ManParini, as a close friend, often smoothes out Vidal's narcissistic edges and mutes his sarcasm so that we see more of his warmth and wit and fewer flashes of the meanness. This tender approach to Vidal is fine for the personal things and it was nice to see that he was a warmer, more generous and kindly friend than I had envisioned, less self-involved and self-destructive than many of his literary peers, rivals, and sometimes-friends like Tennessee Williams or Truman Capote (the latter who was never really a friend, and occasionally was the target of some of Vidal's more cutting remarks--as well as one lawsuit.)Vidal, handsome, with a dignified manner and resonant baritone --plus his own desire to be considered bisexual rather than homosexual which he considered ""degenerate""--had a different public persona than Williams and Capote did when it came to sexual orientation. So it is very interesting that Gore Vidal, as the writer who was less ""out"", was the one who wrote about homosexual characters with (at the time shocking) openness in his novel ""The City and the Pillar"" while Williams and Capote shied away from it.  [per Wikipedia In 1948, The New York Times book critic, Orville Prescott, was so offended by the homosexual content of The City and the Pillar, that he refused to review it or have anyone else at the NYT review it.] ""The City and the Pillar"" was a very courageous novel in 1948--and would still be controversial today.Parini reminds us that from the beginning Vidal's novels always dealt with very interesting and often unexpected situations and themes. In the 1960s  he wrote ""Julian"" about the Roman Emperor who fought against Christianity spreading through the Roman Empire and then tried to bring back polytheism;  ""Washington, D.C."" was about the time of the  Franklin D. Roosevelt presidency (even though Vidal, like his grandfather, Senator Gore, didn't care much for FDR, writing to his grandfather when Roosevelt died, ""The king is dead, long live the president.""); and ""Myra Breckenridge"", which is alternately considered ""his worst"" and ""a mess"" or ""hilarious satire"".  I read Myra Breckenridge in my teens and remember feeling shocked through the first part, then laughing that it was so completely over-the-top and ridiculous through the rest, eventually shrugging it all off as hit-or-miss satire that didn't seem particularly funny or tragic, just pointlessly absurd..Now, reading Parini's description of ""Breckenridge"" and thinking about the gender discussions in 2015, I think it probably was much more perceptive and original than I appreciated at the time and deserves to be reread and reevaluated, not just ridiculed. In Parini's assessment of ""Breckenridge"",  Vidal sounds quite a bit ahead of his time in his thoughts about gender roles and gender identification.If nothing else, this biography should remind people that Vidal was not just a good novelist but that he wrote about interesting original topics in a thought-provoking way--hopefully,Parini's biography will encourage more reading of Vidal's work--it has for me--particularly as he isn't anthologized like many other writers of his time.And it is stunning to be reminded of just how much work there was. He even wrote a story about an alternate universe (""Duluth"") and a time travel story ""The Smithsonian Institution"". And ""Washington DC""  became the first part of a series of historical novels in his ""Narratives of Empire"". (The others were ""Burr"", ""Lincoln""--both critically well received--""Empire"", ""Hollywood"" and ""The Golden Age"".Also refreshingly different are the religious/philosophical novels--""Live from Golgotha"" about an early Christian bishop,  the novel ""Kalki"" about the end of the world, and ""Creation"", which he considered his best work (and the one I most want to read now). The premise is so complicated that I'm giving the link: Creation: A Novel  Parini's description of how the publisher demanded that Vidal delete 4 key chapters in ""Creation"" is painful to read--but gives a welcome insight into the realities of being a professional writer. Good to know that in 2002 he was able to restore those chapters to the book and republish it.  And somehow in all this writing he found time to write a memoir ""Palimpest"" and then its sequel.I liked and appreciated that Parini mentions each work in some detail (ambitious, since Vidal was incredibly prolific) including the premise and approach and also the critical response to it. My one disappointment here is similar to the criticism Vidal and Parini had of a biography they read, ""It lacks a strong narrative.""  The sad thing here is that a strong narrative was handy--if Parini had shown more about the political developments in Vidal's lifetime that increasingly radicalized him (and he did not become that cliche--""the liberal turned conservative"" as he aged.  Agree or disagree, he was always a trenchant social critic with the courage of his convictions. Unfortunately, those are little on display here, nor are the events that shaped them.)Maybe Parini doesn't share Vidal's left-leaning politics that openly had him speaking out against American foreign policy for the last 40+ years. Or maybe he doesn't want to turn off a lot of readers because it was his politics and his blunt talk about what was wrong with the American (Eisenhower's words) ""military-industrial complex"" and now also ""national security state""--not his sexuality--that made Vidal so controversial, even reviled, by many Americans--and would still do so--more than ever--today.  As a political critic, Vidal's thoughts still have teeth and they are still relevant and important to ponder in their boldness. We miss much of that provocative ""sting"" here.Not to say there isn't some--the gratuitous (and unfair) verbal sniping at Bobby Kennedy after his assassination. The interesting (and strange) correspondence with Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh (and even Vidal gave up on trying to make McVeigh a sympathetic figure).  His thoughts on 9/11, Cheney and oil, and the Iraq war. And yet, like the writings spurred by the Vietnam war--they all get short shrift as far as historical fact goes. It's too bad, because the changing history of America in the 20th/21st centuries--and how Vidal changed with it--would have given it the narrative direction it lacks and prevented it being so much about traveling here or there, seeing these various famous friends or writing this work or that.For example, the notorious televised exchange between Vidal and the condescending rightwing publisher of the National Review, William Buckley Jr, at the Democratic Convention in 1968 is given several pages. But the context of this exchange and that violent convention--President Johnson having 500,000 troops fighting in Vietnam by 1968 accompanied by massive bombings (plus over 55,000 American casualties; and over 2 million Vietnamese killed, mostly civilians)--is barely mentioned. Historical events are often a much-needed context here and they don't appear very much. Sadly, neither do Vidal's critical thoughts about them in interviews and essays--an unfortunate lack and it also keeps us from the vitality of his ""voice"".He was blunt in his criticism of the Patriot Act--but we don't learn about that here. You will read it elsewhere that he called George W. Bush ""the stupidest man in the United States"".  Or his critique of American foreign policy, that he felt it was not as Bush said, because of being hated ""for our goodness"" but, per Vidal, for the greed of oil interests and other multi-national corporations, and a government that was comfortable with deposing democratically elected leaders--and starting wars--on behalf of corporate America. Vidal was blunt in labeling the defense of ""freedom fighters"" and the claims of ""spreading democracy"" as simplistic propaganda.  He liked to challenge Americans' assumptions and beliefs about ourselves and our country and point out when he felt that government was lying. More of that voice of Vidal-as-social-critic would have made this a less amiable but more thought-provoking (if also more controversial) book. Somehow more controversy would have been fitting, though, for a biography of Gore Vidal.Parini does cover Vidal's own two political campaigns although again, without his anger or passion for things to change.  It would have been interesting to read one of his speeches, as a writer (philosopher?)-turned-politician.As time passed, Vidal lost his place on late night television and was left getting his critiques of American political power out at the National press Club speeches. We read about that, also his disappointment that there was no longer an audience for him as there was in the days of Johnny Carson. But one wonders if Youtube videos plus a blog might have been rewarding, had someone taken the time to do it with him. Vidal might have found a natural presence in social media, but perhaps by then he was already feeling too old--or had no one to initiate it with him. A loss, as he was a natural for Twitter--even as he undoubtedly would have mocked the development of social media.Parini resolved the problem of how much of himself to interject by wisely starting each section with a personal anecdote about Vidal. This gives us a story, a personal tidbit, but does not interrupt the flow of chapters. And he starts many chapters with some of Vidal's witticisms, but they are the ""clever"" ones, not quotes that make you really think about the world you live in. Perhaps Parini felt ""the real Vidal"", complete with his political views, would turn off too many readers.  I certainly didn't care for his remarks about the Kennedys (or think they were fair) and many wouldn't like to see Ronald Reagan called ""a triumph of the embalmer's art"", even if it was a double play on his age and what Vidal saw as the outmoded age of Reagan's ideas. Still, that was his voice and it would be a better book to hear it.Oddly, one of the most disappointing things to me in this book was the description of Vidal's will. It is only a postscript following his death in 2013--but, without adding a spoiler, it greatly disappointed me after what I had read up until then. Thinking it over though, I think it was an apt ending for a book called ""Empire of Self"", as I think in the end, Vidal's ego and vanity were just much stronger than his empathy and concern for those who helped him, for causes, and for friends.  Other biographers have said he died as a bitter alcoholic. If true--and Parini doesn't say so--that also would explain it.In sum, this is a good overview of Vidal's life and personality and just as much an overview of his work. For those who lived through those times, this book brings back some memories, fleshed out from Parini's knowledge behind the scenes. For those who are much younger, you may enjoy contemplating a time when America's finest writers were also some of America's most colorful and wittiest personalities--Vidal, at the top of the ""witty"" chart. Occasionally, as with Vidal, they also had something challenging to say about current events and politics and the ideas we believe and take for granted but which may very well be untrue. Hard to hear or not, Vidal's ideas, like his work, remain worth reading and thinking about and this is a very good introduction to him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397PIJYYVJ7PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537565#wasThisHelpful","R397PIJYYVJ7PD","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've wanted this lens for a long time, but just wasn't sure about it because I already have the 35mm Fujinon XF 35mm F1.4 R. Would this really be worth it? I kept looking for one of Fuji's semi-annual sales and when it dropped to $250 last week, I took the plunge.Very very glad that I did.  First, no, it doesn't lie near-flat on the camera as I'd hoped for but for $250 this is a nice alternative, The XF27 makes it a very light, very inconspicuous, snapshot-looking camera, taking much better photos than people actually expect..The XF35 is a great lens, too. Beautiful quality to the photos, wonderful in low light, beautiful bokeh.  But the XF27 really -does- feel like a different lens and makes the camera feel different. It is sharp and light and because you can boost the ISO so high with Fuji, even low light shots at f2.8 often are turning out, though of course the 35mm is better. The glass itself is a little over 1/2"" in diameter, so when you're taking someone's photo it really doesn't look like you're taking ""A Serious Picture"". Perfect for street photography.I was very surprised that the 27mm (41mm equivalent) field of view really -does- make a big difference to me compared with the 35mm. I like the 35mm--and it is lovely for portraits--but I have to admit that it is often a pretty tight shot in some places where you can't back up. The 27mm felt like a much more comfortable, more natural framing (supposedly the closest to what our eye sees)--I really did notice a significant difference--and it gives more context for people when you -want- to see the background. Again, nice for street photography.The lens cap is tiny, with pinch edges, and I use a tether. It takes 39mm filters which are generally pretty expensive. But I got this one from Fotasy Fotasy MRC 39mm Pro 1-D Multi-Resistant Coating Super Slim MC UV HD Filterfor under $10 and it's working well  I put a comparison up to show the different FOV between the 35 and 27 (both at f5.6 for comparison). Really glad to have this, perfect addition to any kit I think (at the sale price).Note: The photos below show two different comparisons. (1) Yard shot, the left is 35mm FOV v. 27mm and (2) the brick wall shows without filter and with filter (dim lighting, but showing the comparisons).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4S38HQGISB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCM0DUU#wasThisHelpful","R1I4S38HQGISB6","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update:  After two weeks I unfortunately felt I should come back and reflect the frustrations (numerous) and drop it from 3 stars down to only 2. Too bad, as right out of the box it looks easily like a ""4 star+ machine"".  But many things just don't work.First it was the touchpad. I'm not super-techie, but I'm not afraid to go into menus and look at settings and try to fix things. There was nothing that fixed the touchpad except restoring the computer to its factory settings (but then you are no longer able to customize the setup as I had before). When I ran a diagnostic test, Windows 10 said touchpad was working perfectly! Too bad that it has been completely frozen and useless for over a week.Luckily, there is an alternative in the touchscreen. It works, but there are times when it's not the right tool for the task. I will get a mouse and see if that will work, but it seems that a touchpad should last longer than two days on a new computer.There is no dvd/CD player, but I have two external ones.  Tried both of them--neither work.  (But, good news!  The diagnostic says they're also ""working perfectly""). This morning one of them at least did successfully install some software (previously I had been tryinig to play movies). So that was some improvement.But then we have the internet. My original plan--because of the data mining and security problems with Windows 10--was to use my current computers at home (Windows 7 & 8) and take the Toshiba when I'm out sometimes using Word and the internet down at Starbucks. Well, I didn't want to download the new Word because (yes, old-fashioned and security conscious) I like to install from a disc. The current Word (a free trial is offered with this machine) only is available as a download and disables features if you don't connect with the internet every 39 days or so. (Luckily I had my old Word 2003 disc which installed fine and worked just fine for my purpose--transferring an in-progress file from one computer to the Toshiba just to do some work down at Starbucks). Anyway, the old discs do work with this laptop, if you don't want to tie yourself to MS on the internet.So, there is no working touchpad, it doesn't play movies on an external dvd (does load software though). And then there's the internet problem. As I say, my first thought was to avoid all the data mining, spyware etc (I disabled what I could find, but trying to troubleshoot have discovered it's actually in quite a few different places). and just use the Toshiba--which isn't saving any important personal information--at wifi hotspots like Starbucks.This plan didn't work because neither Starbucks nor McDonalds' wifi worked.  Nor, when I finally broke down to try it, did my home internet. The network shows up (along with many others) and says its connected but it isn't.Finally, two days ago, although I'd done nothing different, it asked me to log into my router and then began working. (Meanwhile, it sent a message to another computer that uses that router asking if it could make changes to it. I didn't like that, particularly as I thought I'd disabled all those ""contacting others"" features. My router doesn't need anything but the password to connect.Also, at some point, it worked at McDonalds.  And then it didn't.  And after it worked at home, the following morning it wouldn't work. A diagnostic test showed there was no internet access no matter what browser I tried, although the main screen said ""connected"".The other desktop and laptops in the house are working fine with everything (and the laptops had no trouble at Starbucks or McDonalds).Touchpad. DVD drive. Internet access. That's a lot of things to malfunction in barely over a week of minimal use.****Original review:This was a difficult product to review. I'll try to separate the Toshiba design pros and cons from the issues with Windows 10, although of course, they are interwoven, particularly since with 128 GB RAM, this is not a computer where you can choose to install any other OS. It's a Windows 10 machine and you're pretty much stuck with it, for good and for bad.  (I will not be comparing it with the MacBooks because (1) not a fan and (2) they're about 3xs the price). This is a medium-capability, medium-to-inexpensive laptop and has strengths and weaknesses that will be of different importance/weight to different users.To begin with the positives. Right out of the box, it is a pretty silver laptop that is considerably lighter (at 5 lbs) than my current one. The case is sleek, less than an inch high, but if you don't have long fingernails it will be a challenge to open the lid. It lies very flat and there's no lip to pull up on.  Despite its 15.6"" size (measured diagonally), I got this 16"" Case Logic laptop case and it fits just fine and is very light. Case Logic VNA-216 16-Inch Laptop Attache (Black)The picture quality is sharp and bright (1920 x1080HD) and I didn't find the screen unusually glossy at all, as a few other reviews have said they did. Personally, I was very happy to see that MS listened to some complaints about Windows 8.0 and has made the interface here far more user-friendly. Most important, they have brought back the ""Start"" button with a clear menu including Control Panel and Settings (The File Explorer is conveniently already pinned to the Task Bar). It also opens to the desktop view unless you want to enable the tablet (you can choose either one at any time either from the menu, from the little button on the left side of the laptop, or from just changing the position of the touchscreen from upright to flat. Easy.)I really liked the keyboard--both that it is nicely backlit and so easy to see and also that the touch is so nice. Much better ""feel"" than any of my other keyboards through the years. There is a touch screen, touch pad, and you also can use a mouse if you get one (more about these three options later).  I like that it has a lot of ports--1 for a memory/SD card; 2 for USB 3.0, 1 for USB 2.0 and an HDMI port, as well as an audio jack for headphones. This is very important for my usage and many laptops (including Macs) have very few these days.I have had problems with the cursor freezing, most recently when I was activating Windows (you have to go online or call them to activate; I'd chosen ""call"" and a machine reads you a long set of numbers to type in. The cursor froze mid-way and would not become unstuck no matter what I tried). Luckily, in that case, it was possible to finish by using touch screen alone.I think the Skullcandy speakers are good and the sound can get nice and loud if you need it to fill a room (for example, in ""presentation view"" or if watching a movie at a distance); much better than my current laptops in both quality and volume.Now for some of the problems:.  First, I was surprised that it has only 128 GB of memory. Now, it's true my first computer had 4MB, but...time's moved on and you expect 500GB if not 1T these days. However, I'm making allowances for this because this has an SSD hard drive which uses up a lot of memory but is so much faster. The load time is amazing now. And 128GB will probably be enough for most people's  programs and media, unless you do a lot with video or have huge software to store. (This is not a machine for serious gamers anyway.). In any case, external hard drives are so cheap that I don't think the relatively small memory here is all that bad.  And people react in a very impressed way when they hear it has a Solid State Drive, something usually reserved for much more expensive machines.I was -very- disappointed that it doesn't have a built in DVD/CD player, though I know that's a common omission now--compounded by everyone wanting you to store things on the Cloud. Eventually the goal is ""stream everything/store everything"" from remote servers. I know it's the way of the technology world, but I don't like it and plan to delay that in my life as long as possible.  Not only does it not have it's own DVD/CD player, but I was even more disappointed that it couldn't work with the one plug and play, less than a year old, that  I already have, even though the troubleshooting message assured me it was ""working perfectly"".It says it has Media Player (although I didn't see it until I went into Settings and configured it as the default), but I have yet to get it to work. I'm going to try downloading the driver from the MS website (free) and will report back if that fixes the problem.  I had to go into settings to change the music (played off a thumb drive) default from MS's default ""Groove Music"" software to Media Player (Groove Music does work well though with MP3s, I haven't yet tried other kinds of files, but it seems the USB ports and music players have no compatibility issues).Now for my two biggest areas of dissatisfaction. The first is the amount of useless bloatware it comes with -- and they sit annoyingly visible on your tablet or on your desktop. Some, I was able to go in and delete. But lots of others, like Xbox Zappos, ebay and Groupon (among many others that are displayed like valued apps, but actually are just urging you to buy things online) I can't get rid of (so far). You have some options to uninstall programs and apps, but not nearly enough. There are many of them here--on the desktop, all alphabetically listed in the Startup menu--and I think that's wrong, actually. Anyone who wants them will know how to add them and where to find them. The consumer shouldn't buy a product, especially something as expensive as a computer, and be forced to look at unwanted advertisement all the time.The second --and for me, biggest-- problem is regarding privacy and security concerns with Windows 10. I had read a bit before the laptop arrived about how Windows 10 is constantly collecting data about you and beyond that has various settings (often that the user is unaware of unless you know to look for them) where your contacts and other information are automatically being shared with MS--and with others, your ""contacts, friends, family"" and also if people are nearby on the network you're using..I find this idea of forced (and imo sneaky) data mining unacceptable, even unethical.  If you feel the same way, my first advice is to NOT do an ""Express Set up"".  Do ""Custom"". It is easy to read through all of the choices--nothing at all complicated to do, just click ""Yes"" or ""No"". You will probably be as surprised as I was at some of the things it will do without your knowledge if you don't do this.For now, I am keeping this computer off of my home network until I'm sure it's working properly, as I'm not sure how it accesses other computers in your network and if any information is being collected and stored. More to the point, since some of the ""automatically share"" settings are the Windows 10 defaults, you really should go through all the ""Settings"" on your own too, even if you do a Custom setup since other things are embedded in various settings that facilitate sending information to MS and others.  Activating Windows was a slight hassle as I chose to do it via phone rather than the internet--still, appreciated having the choice. The Starbucks wifi hotspot that worked yesterday only gave ""limited"" access today and McDonald's didn't give any at all. No additional settings had been changed since yesterday, when it was working perfectly at Starbucks. And everything was working perfectly with my Windows 7 laptop which I also had with me.Basically, until I fully understand the limits and extent of the data Windows is collecting from my use and also from other computers ""in my network"", as well as how it is accessed by others nearby, I'm staying off my home internet and not doing anything online with this laptop that I would worry about security-wise (banking, etc.) I don't do Facebook, but I'd read up more on Windows 10 before doing social media with it either..That may seem too extreme for some, but some might be interested in considering how much access you want to give Windows 10 from the beginning. (Definitely, avoiding the ""Express Setup"" is a good idea, even if you don't want to go through all the other setting choices, too). Btw, you start with a 30 day free trial of McAfee but I'll probably go back to Norton, even though it will use more storage space.  For this reason--skepticism over all the information MS wants to collect, I'm not going to be using Cortana (the Siri equivalent--a data mining dream) or One Note as I can do without the MS cloud. Also I'm not configuring it with my smartphone. YMMV on all this, but for me the (slight) added convenience of these interconnections with the laptop just isn't worth it.I -do- use the Amazon cloud, reluctantly, but generally feel ""less is more"" when it comes to storing your information on multiple servers. I don't plan to use the MS cloud at all (beyond Windows activation) and they have a lot of ways to get you to do it on this laptop.  I recommend that you go to ""Settings"" and check through every sub-category. There's not that much and it will give you a good feeling for the machine, what it offers and what you are free to change. It's pretty quick and easy and if I didn't know what something meant, I just didn't change or delete it.Given a choice between Windows 8 and 10, I'd definitely choose 10 (less the spyware and bloatware). But between Windows 7 and 10 there's no question--I much prefer Windows 7.  Oh, and if you prefer Internet Explorer to Edge you can choose easily which you want to use and switch back any time. If you want Firefox, you're on your own.Re battery, it took 2 hours to charge and lasted 5 hours--very very good.online on the fly. It doesn't come with much instructions--just a warranty and a double-sided, brief ""Quick Start"" guide (the ""On"" button is on the side, top right, easy to overlook, especially if you're used to having it on the top). But that's why going into settings on your own is a good idea--and choosing ""Custom"" set up.Oh, and I find the rotate-able screen very convenient. I know its not good to sit at the computer too long and with ""presentation view"" or ""tablet view"" I have much more flexibility to stand or move around, or take it with me when using the treadmill or if I want to look at something while cooking. Very nice, in that respect.  I could see the large, flat tabletop style being very inviting for a team that is  standing and collaborating on a project.  The text is easy to read and there are modifications in ""Settings"" to help with access for visual or auditory difficulties. It's easy to enlarge things using the touchpad (actually, it was -too- sensitive, continuing to enlarge it all after I'd enlarged it slightly. But you can decrease that sensitivity in the settings).All in all, this laptop is a good looking and sounding computer with many good things about it, especially in this price range. But I'd be wary about the Windows 10 philosophy of knowing everything about you and I'd recommend to at least opt out of the Express Setup and, if you use your home internet, to avoid giving it the ability to interface with your other computers and instead use a different way of identifying/naming the network to this machine (your internet provider can help with this)..","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6SNWBOJO1E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SBAYIS#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6SNWBOJO1E3","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch was a nice surprise--very well made and attractive at a price that's a third of the two-tone AK watches I usually get. This is my first Armitron watch and it is quite nice as well as a surprisingly good value.One correction re: other review saying the band is 1/3"" wide. It is slightly over 1/2"" which is not heavy, but is also not a delicate band. It is about the width of a typical woman's leather wristband. This is probably a good width for the vast majority of users, but if you like a more delicate, narrow band, I think this wouldn't be a good choice.More re: band The alternating two-tone gold/silver pattern is gives a nice textured look, good for casual use and nice for work, but not dressy. To me, although the links are even in gold and silver, I thought it looked a little more on the silver side for the band. The oblong face--again, medium+ size, not big, but not small and delicate either--is classic and modern-looking with its oblong shape, rounded at the corners. The dial doesn't have numbers, but the dots are very easy to read against the goldish/silver-ish face, and there is a second hand which I always like to have (and you can actually see the diamond accent on the dial, unlike many watches that mention ""diamond"" in their name). I like the slightly beveled edge on the gold around the face because it changes it in the light, sometimes going darker, near-black when you move your wrist in a strong light. Armitron is known for reliability and keeping good time.One word of caution if your wrist is so small that you -always- have to remove links when you buy a watch. This band is adjustable, with one 1/2"" link that does come out (and, no, per other review, you don't need to loosen a screw to remove it. You just have to find the right side of the link and pop it open the same way you would if you were opening it to wear it, but the link will slip off if you need the smaller band. If your wrists are -very- very small, though, that one link will not be enough and because of the design of the band, there is nothing more than even a jeweler could remove. So, that would be my only caution, that this is probably not the best choice for those with very small wrists.Otherwise, it is a very nice watch that goes well with a variety of activities--and is so waterproof that you can even shower and swim with it! (I was happy about this as I often forget to take off my watch in the shower. With this one there were absolutely no problems!)  :","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFCJO1XZ164R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0XXHLM#wasThisHelpful","R2BFCJO1XZ164R","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so impressed by this tuner. It is so accurate--not just giving you ""A"", for example, but showing you the red lights until you get the exact, pitch-perfect ""A"". It was a noticeable improvement to have all the strings turned so precisely. Love this!It is a nice size, too, just a shade over two inches long, with a nice clip that allows it to flip over/down for easier positioning (it doesn't rotate, but that wasn't necessary). The button is on top (narrow side).  My experience with the Polytuning was perfect--after I'd tuned the strings individually and strummed all strings open, it showed a display of all green ""in tune"".  When I threw one out of tune, it showed up clearly in red and was quick and easy to readjust with this tuner.  FYI, I used it for an acoustic-electric guitar, a mandolin and a Chinese erhu.

"I have had other cases through the year, but this one is exactly what I was looking for. It is the thinnest & lightest I have, but still comfortably fits my 16"" laptop. It has a handle (as in the picture) and a loop in the back to put it around a cart for airport travel.The shoulder strap is not detachable, but I always carry it that way anyway so for me it didn't matter. I like the deep turquoise nylon lining rather than black or orange and the small USB holder inside is convenient. Outside there is a pocket that zips sideways for the power cord etc. and there is also a generous sized pouch with a zipper across the front underneath it. for even more storage--always a good thing.It is sturdy and well made but very lightweight.

"I sometimes see a hummingbird in the yard, but have never fed them before. So I'm giving this product an extra star, up to 2, because its a good idea to do it, especially during our drought. (Good reminder to leave drinking water out for birds and other animals, too).The good points? This is very easy to mix, as promised.  3 oz of water (I used a pyrex measuring 1 cup--the line for 3 oz is right there) plus 4 level teaspoons of the mix. Stir for a few seconds and the powder dissolves, leaving the water clear. This is all good. (I would -never- get the one with red dye in it. Why would anyone want to give Red Dye 40, suspected of being carcinogenic, to a little hummingbird?)That said, this is not just sugar and water either, which is why I've lowered the review to two stars. Sucrose (sugar) is the first ingredient, but two other preservatives are also listed--sodium benzoate and tartaric acid. Those put me off a bit because, like the red dye, it seems like a bad idea to give artificial preservatives to hummingbirds, especially when it isn't really difficult to make your own sugar and water combination.This is good in that you don't need to boil anything--mixing is extremely quick and easy. But if you do it yourself, you don't need to give the hummingbirds the extra chemicals and it only takes a little longer to mix and boil and cool it (like making a simple syrup only instead of 1:2 you use 1:4).Just combine 1:4 ratio of regular white sugar to water (for example, mixing  1 tsp sugar to 4 tsp water or 2 oz sugar to 8 oz of water.) Heat in a pan on low flame while it dissolves for a minute or two and cool completely before putting it in your feeder. Pretty easy. I think it's better to just make a batch on your own, than to give hummingbirds artificial preservatives that are so unnecessary and may even harm them over time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QE0402E0HPY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM70DDI#wasThisHelpful","R2QE0402E0HPY1","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a purse this exceeded my expectations. Knowing it had a nylon exterior, I expected it would be filmsy, but it wasn't. It's collapsible, of course, but has more sturdiness than I expected because of the cloth lining. The two front-facing pockets with magnetic closures have limited usefulness, I think,  but there is also a zippered pocket kind of concealed on the outside of the purse right behind these two.  On the other side there is another zippered pocket running across the length of the outside front.  Nice design, with a variety of zippered pockets, inside and out, impressive in such a relatively small, and inexpensive nylon bag.I was so glad to find a shoulder bag this size--not small, but smaller than any I have, a nice ""medium"" size.I also like that there is no flap on top--just the zipper across the top giving a quick and direct access. Inside there are  two ""open"" pouches on one side and a zippered pouch on the other. Sometimes it seems a little difficult to open wide enough to search for things (the interior is also black) but the zipper goes completely across the top from one side to the other, so that's probably a matter of getting used to a bag this size, about 9"" across.The burgundy and purple ones look like nice colors and at the time I purchased this, they were $3 less expensive. But I wanted black, to double as a camera bag (with some Velcro and pads added inside--I've been through so many and dthis is great, and about $40 less than the closest thing--not as good--that I was looking for.)  The only negative is that the shoulder strap is about twice as wide as ost people would probably like, and doubled over, too. At least its sturdy, but it takes a little away from the nice design of the bag. (Again, a perfectly fine strap for a camera bag). Great price. A nice find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31Q6KVQ9G2AKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYV2KYQ#wasThisHelpful","R31Q6KVQ9G2AKI","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the Wellness products because the ingredients are so good and they put effort into the ""presentation"". It may sound funny but those with a fussy cat know that what makes them eat one thing over another can be mysterious. A lot, for mine, has to do with the smell, I think, and the texture. At the moment, the only wet food she'll eat is $1.79 small packets of Fancy Feast Broths Fancy Feast Broth for Cats Classic Tuna, Shrimp & Whitefish, Creamy Salmon & Whitefish and Classic Tuna & Vegetables, 1.4 Oz Pouch, Pack of 27 (sometimes available at $1.20, but still frustrating when she eats a little and is done with it. Seriously, I could get a day of meals at Taco Bell for the amount of food/money she wastes every day in what she rejects--and that's when she's actually eating a few bites. I think they recommend several Fancy Feast Broths a day--probably more for my cat who only licks up the broth and leaves all the chicken or fish. (Dry food is doing better for her, but I've been told its not good for the kidneys for cats to have -only- dry food. A balance of wet and dry is best.).  So the chance to find wet food she might actually EAT was irresistible.The Wellness Divine Duo seafood variety pack has all three seafood flavors they make, all grain free -- Tilapia pate with Ahi Tuna on top (when it's served; it's sensibly on the bottom in the package);  Tuna pate with Salmon on top, and and Chicken pt  with Salmon on top. I liked how it came out--the nice brothy-gravy spilling appetizingly over the pate.  And then...the (somewhat) good news. She sorta kinda likes them. Not easy to give 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night as the gravy/sauce/juice is at the bottom, cleverly designed to spill over the pate when you put it upside down on the plate. It's still about 3xs the amount of the Friskies broths, though and she does nibble a little on the pate after licking up most of the gravy. (Still like a ""broth"" thing, though, for the most part.). I like the pull-off top--doesn't get cat food on my hands--but I wish instead of plastic the containers were biodegradable. .These are fairly costly--about $1.50 per package--but it's good for her and worth a try for any cat, I think..

"This is a dressier, prettier watch than the AK ones I usually get. It is also, surprisingly, about $60 cheaper than the other one.This is a very pretty watch, unusual with the chain bracelet and Swarovski crystal covering over the watch. I really like it. The only criticism one might have is that the watch face itself is fairly small and has the ""modern"" lines on it rather than numbers.

"I liked the look of this online--it seemed large enough for a small dSLR and a lens or two--and the grayish-purple color seemed a refreshing change from the usual black camera bags.  I have many Lowepro camera bags and they make a good, quality product. The discounted price here at Amazon brought it from ""puzzlingly expensive"" at $70 to ""realistic"" even possibly a good deal, depending on the construction and design, at $30.Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when it arrived. First, it is bigger than it looks--if you hold an 8x11"" paper horizontally and imagine adding about 2"" more so its 8x13"", that's about how large it is, like a large shoulder purse, not so much like a slingshot bag.But that actually wasn't a problem. The problem was that it is a nylon bag without padding. Yes, it has some nice design features--like an ouside open pocket on the right side for a small tripod or some other gadgets or a lens, a zippered pouch on the front and back, and a double zipper across the top of the bag itself (something I always like, being able to open and close it from either side). But...it has no padding!!!I don't know what Lowepro was thinking because in terms of protecting your camera, you'd be better off with a regular leather purse and an insert for the camera.Maybe that's what the thought is here. Because there IS a gray soft ""box"" with heavy protective padding and Velcro strips on the bottom so you can position it in the center (or the sides) of the interior of the bag.  It's about 7"" tall and 4"" wide, so you could probably stand a small dSLR or similar camera on its end with a short telephoto lens on it and it would fit. But since it doesn't attack to the sides of the bag, it seems kind of ""floppy"" in the middle or, as I preferred it, pushed over to one side, leaving half the bag for other things.It seems like such a good idea, but didn't quite work for me. Maybe if you only had the one camera to fit in the padded box it would be a good travel bag, particularly abroad, because there is significant amount of room for your other things and it doesn't look at all like a camera bag. But if you are looking to bring several camera-related things in a bag with good protective padding for all of it, I don't think this would be a good choice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMZNCTTTSP7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO089XO#wasThisHelpful","R1DMZNCTTTSP7M","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially, I was excited to try this. At this price point, it had to be exceptional, right?Unfortunately, while most of the ingredients are very good, I don't understand--especially with non-organic ingredients--how Nature Valley justifies the price.Other than that, though, after trying it for a week I had to come back and raise it from 3 stars to 4 stars because I actually -do- like it quite a bit. Things I -do- like?  I like that the oats are toasted (though very lightly and apparently that's where the sugar content is, in the oats, because they are slightly sweet--there's no sugar in the bag itself. The dried blueberries don't have a ""fake"" taste and are nicely tart and chewy. I also like the nuts, the sunflower seeds, although I wish there were more almonds. It is easy to throw in anything more to change the proportion (I'd add slivered almonds, personally, and chopped dried apricots for some added vitamins and flavor. But its also fine just ""as is"").On the downside, it doesn't taste too sweet. I was surprised to see sugar as the second ingredient.  (The calorie count--230 calories per serving--doesn't really bother me because this is obviously supposed to be treated as a meal, not a low-calorie snack.).On the ""hot v. cold"" debate, I often cook oatmeal, but I like it very non-mushy, a texture I was not able to achieve with this. And it is muesli, not granola, and didn't work for me eaten alone, cold, as it isn't toasted/crunchy enough. However, when I make cooked oatmeal, it's nice to stir it in right before serving for some nice extra flavor and texture.Where I really liked it a lot, was mixed with cottage cheese and fresh fruit (strawberries, bananas, etc.) for some nice added sweetness and crunch. The blueberries worked well to add tartness that was nice--a very nice summer lunch. It also was good either replacing the Nature Valley bran cereal in my breakfast or added to it--a combination of cereal, fresh fruit, non fat milk and a splash of half-and-half then topped with a ribbon of honey that is very refreshing and delicious,. So, I guess I really do like this quite a bit--just not so much on its own as mixed with my usual breakfast. At the price, that might be a good thing as it will last longer added to oatmeal, bran and cottage cheese which are all pretty inexpensive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5BODOASE313/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFNXJE#wasThisHelpful","R2P5BODOASE313","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish when I was a child we'd been able to do this--pay $22 to write and illustrate a 14 page book that comes back as a nice little 8 x 5.5"" (a standard trade paperback size, though of course, very thin) book! This provided so much fun--and is not the kind of thing a child finishes all at once if s/he's really enjoying it--so a nice project to bring on errands where lots of waiting is involved, to take out on a rainy day, bring to someone's house when you go visiting, even entertain your child when she's finished a meal at a restaurant and you want to stay and visit longer. Also a really nice gift. I got one to keep at home when a friend's child comes to visit--he can start it here while we talk, then take it home to finish later. (For less independent or younger children, of course, it's a nice time for parents to sit together with them while they're creating something and want to talk about it/need your help).The kit comes with 14 ""book pages"" with a box for 2/3's of the page to include the drawing and 1/3 below it, with six wide-spaced lines, for the text. There are also two completely blank pages (except for the omnipresent border so you know the part that will be printed) for the front and back cover.  One cute thing:  You can send a 2x3"" photo and a couple of lines (again, there's space designated for it in the instructions) and this will be printed as ""About the Author"" on the back.The kit also includes the clear and simple instruction sheet (obviously, for the age of child intended, this will be read and explained by the parent in most cases)  The ""hardest"" direction is probably about the page numbers--write them in pencil on the back of each page; otherwise, its printed in the order received.It also comes with a set of ""Ultra-clean Washable Crayola Markers"", a pre-paid mailing envelope with postage pre-paid (the $22 for the kit really IS the only added cost, unless you want different markers than these 8 bold colors).  You might want to make Xeroxes of the pages while they're still blank--I did and was glad to have them in case of mistakes.A note about the book in finished published form. The quality of the final product is nice, and I was surprised that anyone would be making a bound paperback so inexpensively until I saw the company listed ""Lulu Jr"".  Lulu Inc is a major self-publishing company with clients that now occasionally include some of the major publishers in the U.S. when they need a quick copy of a book ""Printed on Demand"" (POD). I've used them myself and their books are indistinguishable from any paperbacks you see in Barnes and Noble. Obviously, this book only has 16 pages so it looks a little different; nevertheless, in getting it, you are dealing with one of the major ""publish on demand"" companies in the United States. Thinking about it, I actually think this is a rather brilliant marketing idea--not making any money on these little individual books for children, but letting parents become aware of how easy it is to publish their -own- book (cookbood, memoir, photos etc) through Lulu. Clever!In any case, this little book your child makes is going to be printed by a major independent publishing company which means you're not gambling with the quality when you buy and send this. Terrific for young children and a great way to get older kids and their parents thinking about publishing longer books of their own, perhaps as gifts or to sell.**Note re: using Lulu for self publishing books of your own. They're great for individual copies. If you want to sell a book on Amazon, however, I'd recommend instead: (1) reading Aaron Shepard's book on POD (printing on demand); (2) buying your own ISBN from Bowker and (3) using Amazon's CreateSpace.  You'll save considerable money and be able to track your sales that way, with CS, in a way that you can't with Lulu. But for easier-to-format-on-your-own copies that you don't plan to sell, Lulu is excellent and will give you a product that looks the same as CS or other reputable POD company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2790ZB2K8VA4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZKXTZY#wasThisHelpful","R2790ZB2K8VA4S","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try a lot of conditioners and this one is unique. At under $5 I thought it was a good value, especially since it really worked. They say it's for ""aging"" hair--dry, brittle, heat-and-color treated--so regardless of age, many women will find it helpful. I wasn't sure what to expect--didn't leave it on the suggested 3 minutes (more like 1 minute)--but it was a genuine surprise. My hair (normally wavy) was straight without blow drying and not flat like any conditioner remained--it had volume, softness. It normally doesn't look dry (because I've stopped coloring it), but I could see it has a nice shine from the coconut oil. There is very little scent, and what there is is faint and pleasant.

"If I were in a hurry when charging things, I wouldn't be marking this as high, but I'm not. I tried charging a cell phone (1 hour) and my Kindle Fire (4 hrs) and my small camera (1 hour) and I was fine with all of it. This portable charger takes about 4-5 hours to charge from a laptop and that was fine, too.  It is able to deliver at least 1 full charge for a smartphone (iphone or Galaxy) or tablet (and possibly even 2, depending on the smartphone).I also didn't find it large or heavy or awkward. It fits in your hand, a little longer than your palm--4.5"" long and 5.5 oz--a size and weight that I find perfectly acceptable for the purse or luggage or camera bag or laptop bag that I would be carrying it in.  It has a belt clip that I wouldn't use, but someone else might find convenient. As for the flashlight, while it wasn't powerful, it illuminated the dark yard just fine--easy to walk or see what you are looking for. I don't see how it is like a cell phone light--at least not mine--because it is definitely directional and shines a spreading (if not super-bright) beam of light in front of you.I really like that it is waterproof (not just water resistant) to the point where it can be emersed in water for 30 minutes, possibly as much as 90. I also like that the top removes so you can use the micro USB or regular USB port to charge from BUT the top remains tethered to the powerpack so it cannot be lost. (The disadvantage for me is the very short cable that comes with it--the length isn't such a problem but when the powerpack is closed you can't attach it--meaning it can't be left with it and could be more easily lost).Overall, I thought this was durable, a good size and weight to carry on a trip, keep in the car for emergencies, or keep in a camera bag. I have had cameras, tablets and cell phones go dead before when I either didn't have the charger or had no way to charge it (as in camping). For me, this will be a very handy product to avoid those kinds of problems in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19O5ZSYWYMUZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBAE3SA#wasThisHelpful","R19O5ZSYWYMUZ5","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good biography, with an amazing amount of research and detail integrated into the story of Lyndon Johnson up to his second run for the Senate in 1948. I particularly appreciated the description of the difficult, draining life for farmers in the Texas Hill Country. Of particular strength, for me, was the lengthy description of the hardships women (including Johnson's intellectual mother) faced in raising families and keeping the home without any running water or electricity. Beyond the lack of electric light, gas stoves, washing machines and dryers--conveniences that we all take so for granted now--even ironing clothes was arduous, not to mention lugging the gallons of water from the well to the house in order to take a weekly shower or wash clothing and dishes. Everyone living in America today should read those chapters because it is a great reminder that as overwhelmed as we can be by housework today, rural families in the years before Franklin Roosevelt had it much, much worse.What impressed me most about this biography was Caro's ability to organize so much information, so much research and details about so many people into clear sentences, paragraphs and chapters. It is almost overwhelming to read it all and impossible to imagine it wasn't overwhelming to contemplate organizing it all into clear, readable prose. But Caro did, and there are even many times when his sentences go beyond ""competent and informative"" to sparkling and even brilliant prose.He makes a compelling case for a Lyndon Johnson who is far from the fatherly figure he tried to achieve in his Oval Office addresses as the president who started--and stubbornly presided over--the Vietnam War.  The child of a charismatic, idealistic father who descended from social status as a Texas legislator to a dirt-poor,failed cotton farmer, Caro's Johnson is convincing as an insecure boy who used every bit of intelligence, magnetism and personality in the service of his one goal: ""to be somebody"", in particular, to achieve the highest recognition from the public as President of the United States.On this path to the White House, Caro introduces us to the Lyndon Johnson who had tremendous talent for making people like him (I would never have guessed, for example what a natural teacher he was--and a motivator among teachers as well, even when he was only in his teens. Caro left no doubt for me that he could have excelled in the classroom and easily reached the top administrative positions in education, if he had wished to have that career.)But instead his single-minded ambition required political power--his own and others'--and it also required lots and lots of other people's money. Caro shows the hard work Johnson brought to any task he took on--campaigning for Texas congressmen and showing ""political genius"" in the process while only in his teens, becoming one of the most effective legislative assistants in congress, developing all of his political skills as a congressman and finally reaching the pinnacle of his career as a wheeling and dealing senator, doling out punishments and rewards--the latter, whether in committee appointments or cold, hard cash, since eventually he had access to millions thanks to his favors done for oil and construction interests from Halliburton (Brown & Root) to the oil men who knew that, Democrat or not, Johnson was their man in Congress. They paid him back generously for his favors.This volume does not go as far as his successful run for the senate. Those 7 years are covered in ""The Means of Assent"" followed by ""Master of the Senate"", and ""The Passage to Power"", about his years as vice president. Caro's fifth volume (and it is hard to imagine there won't be a sixth needed to cover this period, 1963-1973) is still being written. The arc from Johnson's life in the Texas hills as a poor boy to the reviled multi-millionaire president who presided over the Vietnam War that killed over 58,000 Americans and over 2 million Vietnamese is an fascinating, if often dispiriting, story of megalomania and greed.  To his credit, Caro does not skimp on the positive attributes Johnson had, but they fail to balance out the tragedy for the nation in the way that he used them.I admire this book and certainly learned a lot from it, particularly about the workings of Washington poiticians from the mid-1930s to the mid-1940s. But when the admiration began to fade amid the wealth of minute political detail, I felt a little disappointed, almost cheated. Caro is so fixated on the political life of Lyndon Johnson--so much on the personalities in Washington at the time--that the ""big picture"" of life in the United States during the years of the 1920s through the 40's is often missing. He touched on Coolidge and Hoover's attitude toward the poor, but I would have liked to know more about the economic forces behind the Stock Market Crash in 1929 and more about the effects of the Depression. He mentions the opposition to labor unions in Congress--and the support for them by other politicians--but the labor movement itself gets little attention. Similarly, this is the period when World War began in Europe and also, two years later, when it began for the United States. Again, I wished for more of a ""big picture"" more global events, more social history, more economic forces. There is too much for me at any rate) of the battle between Roosevelt and John Garner (his VP). It goes on and on and on and that's true of so many things here, including Johnson's relationship with oil man and publisher Charles Marsh (and his affair with Marsh's mistress), his relationship with the Brown brothers (very important, but you know these are not the only wealthy patrons he has--where are the oil men who Johnson told Bobby Baker he was ""working for"" when he reached the Senate?)The machinations of Johnson in purchasing a struggling radio station then and using his position to get special favor from the FCC is important because it shows a pattern of turning political power to personal financial advantage. But Caro sometimes belabors the point to an exhausting degree. If I want to know in detailed chapters about something from the 1940s, I would rather it is about the economics of the New Deal and how it was changing America, or how the U.S. was changing in response to the rise of fascism in Europe, instead of about the bitter feud between FDR and Garner, and how it involved Texan Sam Rayburn . I think these nearly 1000 pages could have included more of the ""big picture"", and instead painted much political minutiae with broader strokes in many cases (and also kept the focus more on Johnson--often Caro goes for pages with no mention at all of Johnson) AND could have cut many of the unremarkable details along the way to do it, and still been 200 pages shorter. Not to say it isn't a valuable biography of Johnson, but I wanted to make it clear why such a monumental work isn't getting the highest rating possible, despite being so well researched and well written.Also, for those who want to learn more about what Lyndon Johnson was like from two men who worked for him, I recommend press secretary George Reedy's highly readable, ""\\\Lyndon B.

"""On March 13, 2013, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergolio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, was elected to the papacy, becoming the first  Pope Francis.""So begins the introduction to this book, written by Dublin's Father Michael Collins. There is text on nearly every page--clear and succinct, often several paragraphs long--but it takes a distinct second place to the full color pictures taken by one of the pope's official photographers, Rodolfo Felici, a man whose family  has been photographing the Pope  since his great-great-great grandfather began back in the 19th century.I included the quote aove from Father Collins because it illustrates his succinct  writing style, a style that I appreciate from someone describing this much admired and increasingly controversial, Pope. It is flattering and informative without being fawning.From the beginning, Pope Francis--the first Jesuit to become Pope--was different. Finding ways to reduce ostentation, in one of his earliest decisions he chose to live in a simple room where guests usually stay at the Vatican rather than in  the opulent quarters reserved for Popes and he continues to seem determined to avoid many of the luxuries favored by some of his predecessors. To the surprise of many, he has continued to take inspiration from Jesus' humble work with the poor, and to seek out those who are marginalized in society, reaching out to the poor and ill, but also to Rome's prisoners and even to convicted Mafiosa as part of his effort to remind people--Christians and non-Christians alike--of the love that Jesus had for his fellow men and women, no matter how ""lowly"" society may feel they are.I am not a Catholic, which I mention only because--although I enjoyed this book very much and think other non-Catholics would, too,--I think much of the text (and many of the photos which aren't particularly ""art photography"") would be even more meaningful to those who share  Pope Francis' faith. Still, it has much to offer to non-Catholics as well, and I'd like to give some of those highlights (other than Father Collins' clear prose and the fascinating photos of Pope Francis before he became Pope,  his parents, his childhood,, and even a few from his ministry in Argentina.)I had read about him washing feet in prisons and hospitals on Holy Thursday, but I love the photo of him actually doing it--really one of my favorites in a book full of good photos. There is a section about the conclave (election), showing the Cardinals preparing to vote for the new Pope, and also photos of the farewell of Pope Benedict.  These, like so many photos in this book, show details that the television cameras did not capture. If you are at all interested in the traditions and rituals (including many special Masses) that accompany being a Pope, this book is a well done reminder of them.The largest section traces a year in the life of Pope Francis, again, with many  detailed photos including the many many holidays observed throughout the year--again, very interesting and this book makes it easy for a non-Catholic to absorb more about the holidays they have not heard of and to learn more about their timing and meaning.The photos are large--this is a coffee table book--and the page quality and reproductions, though not of the finest quality, are glossy and good considering the amazing price this book is offered (normally $25 aleady an excellent price for a full color hardback cpffee tab;e book, but Amazon discounts it nearly 50%--so, even better--what a bargain!) . Many of the photos are of the Pope and the Cardinals and it may feel a little repetitious in that way--(although there's a nice one of a crowd in Germany is one; and a fascinating view of the Apostolic Palace is another)...one with Barack Obama and so on.  The joy on people's faces in the crowds in St Peter's Square are very moving and the last section was my favorite, showing his travels and the happiness he inspires in the crowds who meet him.(some of the crowds are downright scary in size, though--so huge even when pressed so tightly together. You can feel how vulnerable Pope Francis is, and also how committed he is to reaching out--from Turkey, to Brazil, to South Korea, to Sri Lanka. to the Philippines. .This is not a top-of-the-line art book, and I also had to deduct a bit because the type face is quite small. But, overall, it is a delightful and sometimes even moving look at the very special man who is currently leading the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. Definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19E050D2UX4NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465439838#wasThisHelpful","R19E050D2UX4NS","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice addition for coffee lovers. It looks very nice--7 inches tall and about 2"" across--a narrow, sleek stainless steel cylinder that looks a little like a modernistic pepper mill. It is ridiculously easy to assemble and use. The canister is in two parts. Gently pull the top off and put in your coffee beans (it holds about half a cup at a time). The handle is placed on top of the lid (like a nut and wrench, only so effortless to turn). The bottom part of the canister holds the grounds (you can see them through a little clear plastic slit in the side). I like that it holds the grounds so neatly as you grind the beans and that you can use it immediately or just keep them in the storage space for later.The manual grinder surprised me in two ways: First, it is very quiet. I had to look in to see if it was even grinding (it was). Second, I thought it was so effortless to use the crank. I expected to have to exert some force on it, but, no, you just turn it clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on whether you are making espresso or using a French press) a few turns that glide so easily--nothing like the effort involved with a pepper mill. You can adjust the burr by tightening it or loosening it and that is designed to give you finer grounds or coarser ones. It comes with a brush and a storage bag where you can keep it, the canister and the handle).I love this because it is simple, small and sleek and gives you the opportunity to grind coffee without using electricity (or making noise) and the coffee stores well and tastes so good. Great for an office, for camping, if there's a power outage (I'd pair it with the simple ""My Cup"" which ""brews"" coffee without electricity). A nice gadget at an attractive price (currently nearly half price, at a shade under $20).

"There are a variety of uses for this excellent product. Since Dawn is mild, I even used it on my car. and it cut down the need for so much water to keep rinsing and soaping in our water-conserving state. But for me, these thick Bounty towels + dishwashing detergent are so GREAT for washing dishes that even if that were -all- they did, it would be worth it to me.I'm not a germaphobe, but I really don't like using a dish sponge to wash dishes, even with separate ones for the counter, the dishes and another one for the cat's plates. Even though I microwave the sponges regularly to kill bacteria, it always seems like a basically unsanitary process and also inconvenient. I love using these towels instead.  (You can also use it any way that you would a ""two towel process"" where one is wet and soapy and one is damp and clean (like for quick floor spills cleanup in the kitchen or wiping off things in the bathroom, or cleaning walls or the front of appliances.)I tear off one or two towels per load of dishes, depending on how big it is. These are very sturdy throughout the entire wash--feel like cloth in your hand, no shredding like many regular paper towels would.. There is a lot of soap embedded here and that's fine. It soaps well and rinses well and for me,...just used for the dishes alone...I think these are really worth it. I can do a whole load (without ever touching a sponge; scrubber of course for pans), then rinse it and wipe the counters (it's mostly just full of water by then, so really, it's all that's needed, ring it out and wipe.). And then, here's the best part... I just throw this one sheet away! (in the recycler because now it's just basically a slightly damp paper towel).If you routinely use paper towels in place of napkins, or to carry food on, you obviously wouldn't replace those uses with these. We've been using napkins and the kitchen towel more regularly for food carrying and hand drying--it's less wasteful than always grabbing a paper towel anyway.It is easy to also have a regular white roll of paper towels and not get confused between them. These Bounty have a very distinctive light blue pattern on them so that it's easy to tell these are the ones ""for cleaning only"".They are also useful to have in an RV and for campingSo much better than using a sponge and soap. So convenient and, since they are recyclable (unlike the sponges), it doesn't even adding wasted materiel to the process. You still need dry paper towels for other kinds of uses, where you don't want soap (dryng your hands, etc.) These are so ingenious and useful. Really really like them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IO105UFHMGF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYAMVTK#wasThisHelpful","R2IO105UFHMGF0","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anything that helps with organization and is unobtrusive doing it, I appreciate. This is exactly as it claims to be--a clear plastic tray with 1/2"" --wide cut outs all around--wide enough to let things stick through when you want--like long pens or long narrow tubes- but narrow enough that nothing will fall through them (and only about halfway down each side). It sticks, as promised on stainless steel, glass, finished wood, plastic, tile or metal--I tried it on all of them and it (1) adhered and (2) removed without damaging the surface when I pulled it off. The backing is ""an innovative dry adhesive technology""--very cool, and clear. Even though it doesn't stick permanently and doesn't leave any marks behind, I wouldn't move it around too often (although Elmer's says you can reuse again and again. After three times it wasn't working ve ry well any more. However, they are washable so I'll test if that restores it.I have this one holding my sunglasses at the front door (Tried to hook the car/door keys hooked around one of the little groove in front.but they were too heavy.. I'd like to another one for the computer room to keep pens, reading glasses and memory card holders in--very useful. A very good product.ETA: Just to add, I put it on the side of an oak desk and hung a ring of keys over the edge. Too heavy. It fell on the carpet. Tried again to be sure. Fell again. Now had too much carpet residue to be able to stick at all. I thought ""wash it!"" to restore the sticking. I did, but so far, it isn't sticking well enough to even hold my sunglasses.  My advice would be to not put anything as ""heavy"" as a car/house key ring in to begin with and also not reposition it much. Also, don't count on that ""washable"" part to restore the stickiness. Other than that, it is convenient to put anything about the weight of glasses into.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3884U1Q9NQZOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G94D0#wasThisHelpful","R3884U1Q9NQZOA","A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already own a Milwaukee 48-22-2008 8 Piece Screwdriver Set in my work area, but I wanted another set of screwdrivers for the garage so I got these.  My first impression is that the Crescent drivers feel cheaper in the hand and I can't help but wonder if one day the handle will break off of the shaft.  I was going to take a star off for this, but really, if they DON'T break, then it's good enough, right?  That was my thought.  (If I ever do get one that breaks, I'll be sure to update here...)The Crescent set *is* a bit cheaper and has not only more drivers, but all the drivers it includes are useful (I'm sorry, Milwaukee, but I have yet to find a good use for your ""ECX Bit"" drivers.  Must be for jobs I don't do...).  If you are going to get 1 set of screwdrivers to do the broadest set of jobs, this would be better than the Milwaukee set and at this price, it would be hard to find a better option anywhere else.Side note: Having a magnetized tip is good in many scenarios, but not all.

"I love heated blankets--it is hard to beat the sensation of slipping into bed on a freezing cold night when the bed has been heated to a point where if it were any hotter, it might start being uncomfortable. <contented sigh>I've used several blankets by Sunbeam and they are all fine--they do the job. However, this Serta blanket is superior in a couple ways:1) The timer.  How I love the timer.  You see, once you slip into your nice warm bed, you want to relish in the warmth for a while.  However, the warmth combined with the end of the day soon overtake you and you fall asleep only to wake up in an hour all hot sweaty because you fell asleep sooner than you had thought and didn't turn the blanket off.  The timer allows you to set the blanket to turn itself off after a predetermined period of time.  That time can be as little as 30 minutes to as much as 12 hours.  From .5 to 10 you go in 1/2 hour increments and then from 10 to 12 you go in full hours, which gives you 22 choices for how long it's on.  That's all nice, but I must ask, who stays in bed for 12 hours??  I mean, maybe if you're sick, but then, do you really need a timer?  Anyway, I would have preferred being able to set the time in 15 min segments, at least for the first, say, 2 hours.  No worries, though--30 min has worked out just fine for me.  Love the timer!2) The material the blanket is made of is much softer and thicker and warmer by itself than most other electric blankets I've seen.  Just by itself this is a nice warm, comfy blanket.  Also, because it is a thicker material, you don't feel the wires as much.3) The heating coils go further to the edges which in effect makes it a bigger blanket.  I have a queen sized blanket on a king bed and it does just fine covering the whole top (it just doesn't hang down the edges much).So this sounds like a glowing review, right?  Why the 2 stars?  Well, after using it 4 or 5 times, suddenly and without any provocation, the control on one side of the blanket refuses to turn on.  It's not just that the blanket won't heat up (although, that too), but the LCD display doesn't even turn on.  Nothing.  (Note that the other controller still works fine).  Now I'm going to have to go through a returns process which at the moment sound very unappealing.  If I can manage to talk myself into doing it, I'll update to let you know how it went...","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OAN56JB04QBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHFT10#wasThisHelpful","R3OAN56JB04QBZ","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My phone's headphones jack is broken so I rely on Bluetooth in order to get music out of my phone without having to use the horrible built-in phone speaker.  Usually that means I have to use an adapter, but these headphones get rid of that need and are that much smaller and easier to work with.  I don't think they are ideal, but overall, I DO think they are pretty good.PROS:* Small, light, not a lot of excess cord dangling around, no extra adapters needed* While not water PROOF, they are pretty water resistant* A fit that is both comfortable and secure.  I haven't tried to wear them for more than an hour at a time, but that hour was completely painless.  It also stayed put as I rode my bike off-road.* As part of the above point, they come with different sized ear pads, which is pretty common, but the size difference between the largest and smallest is actually pretty significant. A lot of other headphones have pads that are all pretty close in size so if you have very small ears (like kids, for example) or if you have large ears (hey, some people do) then you're out of luck, but if you are some variant of ""average"", then they got you covered.  With these, Jabra instead decided to cover all practical sizes instead of catering only to the most average sizes.* I like to listen to music while I bike which is a challenge because there is often a lot of wind noise when you use headphones.  I thought these would be especially bad since they are so large, but they actually did fairly well.  Don't get me wrong--there was still a fair amount of wind noise, but it wasn't as bad as by other ear buds.  I guess the shape is more aerodynamic or something...CONS:* The wire is not as supple i.e. it is more stiff than most headphone wires.  This makes it a bit unruly and difficult to get it adjusted just right.  HOWEVER, on the plus side, I suspect this means less bounding on the back of your neck when you run (since I don't run, I can't say for sure).* Although you certainly CAN wear glasses (prescription or sunglasses) with the headphones, the over-the-ear design does make it so they do interfere just a bit.* The headphones has a microphone built in, but the person on the other end said I sounded very distant and quiet.  I'm sure this is because the microphone winds up more behind your head than by your jaw (as is pictured in the ad).  That was in a quiet room.  I didn't bother trying it outside.OBSERVATION:The music sounds very flat to me--not as much bass as I'm used to in ear buds.CONCLUSION:Currently my best set of headphones for use while biking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M2G1MPTF08GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161D1CQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2M2G1MPTF08GR","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These chocolates are very soft and very creamy and just melt in your mouth.  The texture is masterfully done.  My only disappointment was the fact that so many of them were just smooth, creamy chocolates.  The ones that had any texture at all had way too little.  Based on the descriptions, I picked out all the ""nuttiest"" ones I could find and felt like all of them were underdone from a crunch standpoint.  It was a bit disappointing.  For reference, See's ""nuts and chews"" are more my thing.  And that leads us to an important point: these are Swiss chocolates.  There are many chocolate lovers that will insist that European chocolates are the best and that everything from the US is garbage.  I agree that they taste different, but in all honesty, I prefer the domestic stuff, generally speaking.  That's a matter of personal opinion and I suspect I'm in the minority (my wife thinks the creamy-only texture and European quality is perfect), but these chocolates absolutely have that European chocolate quality to their taste (whether that's good or bad is up to you).The box the chocolates come in makes for fantastic presentation which in turn makes this a great gift.  I was going to post a few pictures, but it appears that Amazon has already provided a good detailing of what you will get.  I am uploading a picture of the little ""booklet"" that people are talking about because I was under the impression after reading the reviews that it would be something more than what it was.  Really, it's just the same as what you see in the ""From the manufacturer"" section.  This isn't a bad thing, but I wanted to set the record straight.A great gift idea, if you like being a bit spendy.  There are many people (ex. my wife) who will find the super-creamy texture and the European style an absolute delight and I'm sure they would all love this decadent gift.  Just make sure you buy when the weather is cool--it would be a pity to have them all melt in the delivery truck on the way to your house (it was very cool when I ordered mine, so that wasn't a problem for me).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJ5Z425TVMLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGI0#wasThisHelpful","RTJ5Z425TVMLG","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A while ago I got a BRAVEN 805 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker [18 Hour Playtime] - Orange/Gray.  I was very impressed with the sound quality, esp. given the size and gave it an excellent review.  I still like the Braven, but I have to say as good as it is, this NYNE has a much bigger, fuller sound.  That makes sense given that it is quit a bit bigger and heavier.  The Braven weighs in at 2 Lbs. 13 oz. (1.3 Kg) while the NYNE is a hefty 6 Lbs. 10 oz. (3 Kg).  The physical dimensions are also significantly different, as you can see in the attached photos.  This, along with the shapes, make the Braven easy to pick up as is, while the NYNE really does need the carrying handle to tote around.Speaking of shape, I was worried that the speaker would have a tendency to want to tip over backwards, but it appears to be pretty solid.  If it's going to tip, it will be backward, but I am not going to worry too much about it.  However, if you have anything plugged in, it will be in the back, so having the foot just a little longer in the back wouldn't have been a bad thing.The buttons on the NYNE are huge, but all black.  In contrast, the Braven's buttons are much smaller, but the high contrast actually makes them easier to see.  One of my primary complaints with the Braven was the fact that they were trying to do all the functions with as few buttons as possible.  I'm pleased to see that the NYNE has dedicated ""Skip forward"" and ""Skip backward"" buttons.  It also has a little light to indicate that the power is on (in addition to a physical switch which you can use to prevent accidentally turning it on, say, in a bag).  Another light flashes when it is trying to pair to a Bluetooth device.  These address other beefs I had with the Braven.The battery indicator light is better on the Braven--there are 5 LEDs that show you the relative amount of power left in the battery whereas the NYNE has 1 that starts blinking when the battery is low.  Also, the NYNE's battery charging light is a light blue when it is charging and turns green when it is done.  Now that I know this, it makes sense, but it wasn't obvious what the status of the battery was when I plugged it in.  Was it charging?  Was it just on?  Both the Braven and the NYNE have aux level inputs and USB outputs to charge your devices.  Both can be used as a hands free device for your phone (though I haven't really ever used this feature on either one).The Braven has a cool feature that lets you pair your phone to it and then pair it to a second Braven for stereo sound.  I was not surprised to find that the NYNE doesn't seem to  mention anything about being able to do this.  The Braven also has a sound enhancement mode (I forget what they call it... if you are familiar with Sony's ""Megabass"" it's like that), but honestly, I don't see why you would ever want to turn that off, and as mentioned before, NYNE's sound is pretty rich already.The NYNE also allows you to pair your device to it by using NFC.  Simply turn your Bluetooth and NFC functions on and then tap the side of the speaker, and voil, you're connected.  I have another Bluetooth device that was supposed to do this and I couldn't get it to work.  The NYNE, however, worked perfectly on the first try.  Not that pairing Bluetooth is in any way difficult, but it's a nice touch.The NYNE comes with a power adapter that, like the Braven, appears to be able to be adapted to different country's voltages/plug styles.  Unlike the Braven, the NYNE only came with the one for the US (that's OK--I doubt I'll ever use the other ones that came with the Braven, anyway).  It also comes with an aux cable (1/8 stereo mini jack, male-male, straight and right angle) which you can use if you are trying to play audio from a device that doesn't support Bluetooth.Another strong win of this over the Braven is the price.  At the time of the review, it is close to 1/2 the cost of the Braven.The only ""con"" I found was a small thing--at full volume there was some distortion.  Not a buzzy or crackly sound of the speaker being overworked or the amplifier chirping, but rather it made me think that perhaps some capacitors couldn't hold quite enough charge for the peak sounds as there was sort of a quick fade-out-fade-in sort of distortion.  That's OK, though because I don't plan to listen to this at full volume.  I just turned it down 1 notch and the distortion was almost completely gone.  1 more and I couldn't hear it at all anymore.  And that was still quite loud.  What this means to me is simply that they allow you out of the ""RMS"" range and a little further into the ""peak"" range than I want to go, so I won't go there and we can all be happy.If you are ok with a large speaker, this will do you very well.  If size is an issue, then the Braven would probably be better for you.  Both are great speakers but the NYNE really does have a much fuller and bigger sound.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1FAWN93N9K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFMLS0#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1FAWN93N9K1","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Installing this was a snap.  It comes with everything you will need from wire nuts, to pre-stripped wires to a cover plate.Pop the cover off the bottom and you have a 3-position switch to choose the mode and 3 different dials to change sensitivity to motion, sensitivity to light and time delay to shut off if there is no motion detected.The 3 position switch lets you choose between ""Off"" (fully manual--you have to press the button to turn on and again to turn off--like a normal light switch), Occupancy mode (auto on/auto off) and Vacancy mode (manual on/auto off).  I use ""Vacancy mode"" because my kids for some reason can't ever remember to turn the light off in their room, so it's usually on all day.  This has fixed that.Something I would have liked would be a way to have the motion sensor ""look"" more to one side or another.  In the kids' room, the light switch is off in a corner so almost all the action in the room will be going on to the sensor's left.  99.9% of what goes on to the right is out in the hall and should be ignored.  It would have been nice if the sensor could be angled slightly to either side to try and pick up more of what goes on on the left side and nothing of what goes on to the right.  -1/2 starI was a little worried that the net result of this light being automatic would be that the kids would get (even) lazy(ier) and just quit trying to turn any lights off at all.  So far, that hasn't been an issue...An easy solution that has been good enough so far.  Installation was easy and the price is reasonable.

"I like this tablecloth more than I had anticipated.  The 100% polyester is nice because it cleans well, but usually polyester is coarse to the touch and feels... gross, for lack of a better word.  This one feels more like linen.  It is a very handsome tablecloth with attractive detail and it fits my Ikea table perfectly.  I like the color--it is dark enough that it should hide many food stains, but also a light enough color with enough saturation as to be attractive without drawing too much attention to itself.  I appreciate the understated style.Other reviewers complained of uneven seams and other flaws. I looked, but didn't see any such problems in my cloth.It's really amazing what a properly-fitting tablecloth can do to make a room suddenly feel fancy and elegant.  The kids came in for dinner and immediately assumed there was something very special going on.  The same place settings we always use look better and somehow even the food is more visually appealing.  It's all psychological, I know, and yet I literally felt like last night's normal dinner served on our normal set of dishes and normal silverware was somehow fancy and special.

"We are expecting our 5th and final little one in a few months.  With each of our other kids, I always have a time when I WISH I had a UV filter because everyone in the house is sick except the baby and, since babies can't take cold medicines, I especially feel bad for them when they get sick.  I originally wanted a filter like this one, but it was just too expensive.  Then I tried a cheaper one, but it's so tiny and I don't think it moves enough air to actually do anything.I love that this one has no only the UV light, but a filter as well.  I'm not so much worried about allergens, but I did notice that my cheap UV air sanitizer would get all dusty and I can't help but think that all the dust collecting on the UV light inside has to make it less effective (and it was already woefully inadequate in the first place, as noted).  I also like that this has 3 speeds so that you can balance noise with air flow.  (The good thing is that babies tend to like the fan noise, anyway, so as long as there isn't an ear-piercing whine, they'll probably enjoy the white noise from the fan).One change I would make--the UV light button is a one where you push it once and it is pressed in more and then you push it again and it is popped all the way out.  Other than whether or not the button is all the way in or not, there is no indication as to whether the UV light it is on or not.  I assume ""in"" means ""on"", but it doesn't even state in the instruction booklet if that is the case or not.  I would have liked some sort of indication (a small, not-too-bright LED would been perfect) that the UV light was on. -1/2 starIt's hard if not impossible for me to rate the effectiveness of the UV sanitation without experimenting with it for a few cold and flu seasons, but my initial instinct is that it will do enough without being overkill.

"This is essentially a yogurt in a squeeze pouch.  1/2 my kids liked it, 1/2 did not.  Personally, I thought it was too sweet, although they kind of need it to be sweet in order to counteract the tangy-tartness that is also present.  The overall flavor, in my opinion was fine, but not great.  I'd eat it if I was hungry and there wasn't anything else around, but I'd likely choose something else first if that was an option.The color is very unappetizing, but that's a good thing--it means they didn't add artificial colors to try hide it.  Since you have to go out of your way to see the color, it doesn't really matter, anyway.As I understand it, Horizon is a dues-paying member of the Grocery Manufacturer's Association (GMA) which has donated millions of dollars to campaigns to prevent mandatory labeling and as such, their whole ""We're organic and we care about your health"" thing is kind of lost on me.Bottom line:It's fine.

"First of all, if you have not used Tom's of Maine toothpaste before, you need to give your mouth a week to get used to it.

That's fine--give it a few days and you'll get used to it.  Then, when you switch back to a ""normal"" toothpaste, you'll find that it's too sweet and or too foamy and prefer the Tom's.

"We've had a ""Cooshee Classic"" for years now.  It is now seating it's 3rd kid and we have LOVED it--best ""high chair"" solution we have found for any kid that is about 1 or 2 to about 3 or 4 years (depending on how tall your kids are).Unfortunately, ""kid #3"" is... shall we say, very hard on all his belongings.  We were surprised when our Cooshee's side got ripped--we had thought it would last forever, but then when we thought about all the other things kid #3 has destroyed, we were a little less surprised.  At any rate, kid #3 is still short enough that he'll be needing a booster for a bit longer and kid #4 has just decided that she refuses to be the only one in a high chair--she wants to sit in a normal chair like the rest of us.  ""OK,"" I thought, ""I suppose I can understand that"" and I headed over to Amazon to get another Cooshee...""$50??!""Yes, that's right--a real, BabySmart brand Cooshie is about $50 which is quite a bit more than I had remembered or guessed it would be, seeing as it's essentially just a chunk of foam.  I started to explore my options.I saw that on a certain online auction site, you could get a used Cooshie for about 1/2 that (at least, that was true when I was doing my searches), or for roughly the same price, I could get this ""Prince Lionheart"", Cooshee knock-off brand new here at Amazon.  I went with my second choice-partly because I like Amazon and partly because I like new.  Now I'm thinking I should have gone with the auction site (no negative reflections on Amazon--this is purely based on the product itself).  Here's why...For those of you who like the short version, the Cooshee:1) smells better2) is more stable3) feels better to the touch4) is easier to cleanFor those of you who like details:So, yeah--the first thing I noticed when I took it out of its bag was that this thing smelled awful.  Like chemicals.  Holy cow!  Fortunately, after washing it was warm, soapy water and leaving it out in the hot summer sun all day, *most* of the smell disappeared.  Relief.I've attached 4 pictures to help illustrate my next points.Let's start with the one where we are looking at both seats side by side.  It appears they are nearly identical in size and shape and, indeed, they are very close.  A toddler sitting in either chair will be boosted about the same height and will have ample room for their little diapered bums to sit comfortably.  Note that the texture of the chairs is different.  I'll talk more about that later, too.Next, observe the picture of the underside of the chairs.  Again, the size and shape looks very close.  You can see that the Cooshee is a solid piece of foam with little ""suction cups"" cut into it for better ""traction"" on smooth chairs (and it actually works, too).  Prince Lionheart decided to cut manufacturing costs by leaving a bunch of empty spaces--which is fine, it's stiff enough that it doesn't really need to be filled in.  However, it is noteworthy that material is actually a bit slippery, so they had to put those orange dots on--that's where the friction is that will keep the booster from sliding off the host chair.  I personally found those 3 pegs sufficient, but only just barely.  I would have really liked it if they had doubled the number of those pegs for better stability.The next picture shows my hand squeezing the chairs.  You can see that the Cooshee is more squishy than the PL is, but that both are at least a bit squishy.  I don't know if that's really an important point or not--since the bottom of the Cooshee is solid foam, and since kids are so light, they aren't going to be *squishing* down into either one.  HOWEVER, you can also see that the texture of the material is different.  Both feel smooth, but the PL is much smoother (at least on the arm and back--the seat part is textured).  You can't tell by looking at a picture, but it is also a bit slippery and leaves sort of a slippery residue on your hand if you touch it too much.  I'm hoping that washes off over time, but I certainly don't like it for now. As I was mentioning before, the fact that the material the PL is made of is slippery means they have to add friction points to the bottom, but the Cooshee did not need to do that because although it is smooth, it isn't at all slippery.Which brings us to the last picture: the texture of the seating area.  Obviously, a slippery chair would not be good for little kids to sit in, so they textured this thing up on the seat.  Personally, I don't like the way it feels to touch, but just about as importantly, it's harder to clean.  Little bits of food get mashed down into the texture and then it's very hard to get it back out.  You can see some in the picture I've included.  It's been scrubbed with a dishrag, but I think we'll need a stiff-bristle brush to get that out.The Cooshee Classic is clearly a superior product and arguably worth the extra cost.  NOTE, however, that BabySmart doesn't appear to sell Cooshee Classic anymore--they have changed the design to the ""Hybak"" model.  I don't know if this new model is as good as (or better than) the classic--hopefully someone else can fill us in there.  However, if you're on a budget, the PL is probably good enough, though I'd recommend that you first check that auction site and see if you can't get a used Cooshee Classic, instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIC2UVJFMQSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZBHXOA#wasThisHelpful","R1WIC2UVJFMQSP","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this yesterday and gave it to my 7-year old who likes to get all dressed up and look fancy.  For the price, I think this is a very nice piece.  In my experience, when you buy jewelry online, the item that comes is usually a little bit smaller than I perceived it would be and the colors are less saturated than what it looked like online.  I'm not accusing anyone of being deceptive or anything--it's just that when the pictures are taken, they positioned and lit to look their very best but in normal, everyday usage, they aren't under ideal conditions. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this pendent was at least as big as I had perceived in my mind--perhaps even a little bigger.  The gem itself is small, but the surrounding heart gives it a feeling of being bigger.  Also, the color of the amethyst looked as just about as good as pictured here (your mileage may vary, but I got a good-looking stone).  The chain is very delicate, but not any more so than other necklaces in this price range (i.e., for a necklace in this price range, the chain is exactly what I would expect it to be).Again, for the price, this is a very good piece and I would happily recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBR5MLD3MRXC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPJVAYE#wasThisHelpful","RBR5MLD3MRXC6","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I got all excited about this because I thought it had solar panels built into it.  It doesn't.  Upon further review, I saw that the description says solar READY.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but if you have one of Goal Zero's solar panels, I'm pretty sure you could charge just about any external power pack (with USB input), so I don't know why we are even bothering to mention that.Now with that out of the way, it's still a pretty slick power pack.  It's IPx6 rated and the instructions say""Spray it down, take it to the beach, leave it in the rain - and never worry about rubber plugs.  It's engineered to get out, stay out and handle whatever Mother Nature can throw your way - even a quick drop in a puddle.Do not submerge Venture 30.""Besides the IPx6 rating, it is ruggedized with a rubber surround and I suspect it will handle an occasional drop without complaining.  Everything looks like it can handle abuse.As other reviewers have mentioned, its flashlight is super bright.  If you look straight at it when it is on full, then even in the day time, you'll be seeing spots for a couple minutes.Charge times are rated at:Nomad 7: 8-16 hoursNomad 13: 6-12 hoursNomad 20: 5-6 hours2A USB Source: 5 hoursFinally, it has a shelf mode that allows long term storage.  In this mode, it should keep a charge for up to ""3-6 months"".  The only down side is to exit storage mode, you have to plug it into a power source to reactivate it.  It's a little like priming a pump--if you want water, you have to give it a little water first.The only down side to this battery is its size and weight.  Compared to my other power packs, it's large and heavy, but since it has a high capacity and a rugged body, it's focus isn't just on portability.  This pack is for taking abuse and charging multiple devices at once and it does that well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M7E9IPC38DXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY2HXFU#wasThisHelpful","R2M7E9IPC38DXV","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently lost my pizza cutter that I've had for years and was looking for a new one.  Compared to the other various options out there, this looked like a good choice:1) It looked nice and sturdy2) The handle appears to have a good grip to it3) It's by a brand that typically puts out good stuffI'm very sorry to have to report that this is almost a great product, but falls flat on its face for 2 reasons:1) First and foremost, the wheel does not spin freely.  It spins freely for about 300 degrees (as in there are 360 degrees in a circle) but for the other 60 degrees, there is so much friction on the center axle that it takes a great deal of force to turn the wheel.  This results in the pizza wheel behaving like a round knife that is only somewhat sharp and it just tears the pizza up.  FAIL.  A quick scan through the existing reviews leads me to believe that I just got a lemon, although I do see 1 other review that says his/her cutter's bolt tends to come loose and has to be re-tightened.  This sounds like the same problem, but manifest the opposite way (the opposite side of the same coin, if you will).  That reviewer's bolt was too loose.  Mine is too tight. Hmmm...2) Even if the bolt wasn't a problem, I can't help but notice how much area there is for cheese and sauce to get stuck between the wheel and the supporting structure.  The guard around the wheel is a nice idea, but it's just that much more area that is a bit harder to clean.  I think most dishwashers will handle it, but it's something to be aware of.  I just got a KUKPO Stainless Steel Pizza Cutter Wheel, and since its wheel spins freely, I think I'll get rid of this one and use that instead.  Not that I love that other one--its round, stainless steel handle gets slippery and hard to hold, especially if you have a little grease from the pizza on your hands (the Cuisinart handle is MUCH better in this regard).I miss my old wheel... where did it go?  How does a pizza wheel just disappear like that??  Oh, well, I guess I'll have to keep looking for a good replacement...","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYJ4QGS8RCRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WEZO#wasThisHelpful","R3LYJ4QGS8RCRO","A3D5B2CBFNJB0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D5B2CBFNJB0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beverly Swerling's City Of God is the fourth installment of her five fictional treatments of early American history.  City Of Glory is another sweeping epic of (primarily) two competitive families that takes place in New York City from the 1830s up to shortly before the start of the Civil War; and addresses issues of the times such as poor immigrants living in unsanitary neighborhoods, progress in health and medicine, religious conflict, entrepreneurs in businesses growing wealthier and wealthier, organized labor, slavery and abolitionism.In City Of God, which is the third of Swerling's books that I've read, the author once again provides the right blend of interesting historical facts about (in this case) life in mid-1800s New York City, mystery, excitement, sex, a well-developed plot, and a array of fictional and real characters to make City Of God a book that is difficult to put down. Her strong writing ability made me feel that I stepped back over 150 years in time and was right there with the characters experiencing life during a fascinating time in our history. I highly recommend The City Of God if you are a fan of historical fiction. I'm looking forward to reading Swerling's two other books, Shadowbrook and City Of Promise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRR7WOYURW4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416549226#wasThisHelpful","R1LRR7WOYURW4R","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Killing Lessons is the debut crime thriller by Saul Black (the pseudonym of Glen Duncan who has written some novels about werewolves), and it is a book that will grab your attention from the opening page and, for the most part,  keep you turning the pages at a fast pace throughout.I won't spend time providing a plot summary as this can be found in the Amazon Book Description above. I'll just say that the plot pertains primarily to two of the most psychopathic, violent serial killers you've probably ever come across in your thriller readings who travel around the country killing young women in a horribly sexually violent manner, and to the troubled female detective obsessed with capturing these killers. These killers in some ways make Hannibal Lecter seem tame and in control. Be forewarned that author Saul Black is quite graphic in describing these murders.In addition to the plot being well-developed, the author does a well-above average job in developing his characters and in making the reader understand the mindsets of the killers, the female protagonist, as well as some of the more secondary characters, and particularly of the young girl who escapes from the killers. Further, overall, Saul Black does a very good job in telling his story from alternating viewpoints, settings and time periods -- although, at times, this ""jumping around"" made this reader work a little harder than I would have liked in order to follow everything that was going on.While I, personally, didn't have a problem (at least a big problem) with Black's narrative style, you should be aware that he spares no words in making sure the reader fully understands why the characters act and think the way they do, as well as in making sure the reader has a vivid picture of the various settings in which the plot unfolds. As a consequence of this writing style, I  won't be surprised if some readers will, at times, find his narrative to be too wordy and repetitive. Further, I also won't be surprised if some readers at times feel that the actions of some characters require a suspension of disbelief; although this is something I've have come to expect in many thrillers and, as such, it did not in any way detract from my enjoyment of The Killing Lessons. As a matter of fact, if Black is planning a sequel to The Killing Lessons or another book that features his main character, Detective Valerie Hart, I will be one of the first on line to get a copy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31C8AD3DQYWC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057345#wasThisHelpful","R31C8AD3DQYWC0","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edward Klein once again demonstrates his ability to write a highly informative and insightful expose of our nation's leaders. In Blood Feud, Klein uses his highly regarded reporting skills and his strong access to sources close to the Clintons and  the Obamas to provide a no-holds barred expose pertaining to the mutual dislike, if not loathing, between the two leading families within the Democratic party.Now, as the Clintons attempt to maneuver their way back into the White House, Blood Feud provides some key insights on the political spectacle to come during the 2016 Presidential election.Specifically, some areas in which you'll gain insights in Blood Feud include, but are not limited to, the following:...The deal: why Bill Clinton supported Barack Obama for reelectionand why he feels betrayed...How the oneand onlyWhite House dinner between the Obamas and the Clintons was fraught with tension and contempt...Benghazi: how Barack Obama set up Hillary Clinton to take the blame and why she agreed to go along with (i.e., lie about)  the initial cover-up...The secret Hillary Clinton is keeping that could make it impossible for her to be president...The very serious medical conditions Hillary has had for several years, and that Bill in particular has, that have mostly gone unreported in the media...How the true power behind president Obama is not Michelle, but her close friend Valerie Jarrett, who sets the administration's policies and personnel......Why Michelle Obama's political ambitions could rival Hillary Clinton's...How not just Bill and Hillary, but Barack and Michelle, lead largely separate lives, and...The Oprah factor: how she was used by the Obamasand stroked by the Clintons.Regardless, of your political affiliations and your personal feeling about the Clintons and Obamas, Blood Feud is a book well worth reading for the insights you might glean about these two leading ""first"" families, and about the woman who might be our next president -- and the man who views her presidency as his third term.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q7N615TNFHBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786039116#wasThisHelpful","R3Q7N615TNFHBV","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For Smart Phone owners, particularly those with an Android phone, in the market for a multi-functional Smart Watch, serious consideration should be given to the 007plus GT08 Bluetooth Smart Watch with SIM Card Slot and NFC.First off, let me assure you that after charging the watch with the USB cable provided, pairing this watch with its NFC function with my smart phone via Bluetooth was as quick and easy as placing them next to each other. Further, if you choose to, which I did not, this Smart Watch can be used as a standalone phone by using a micro SIM card (watch is not included), thus enabling you to do everything on your wrist without having to have access to Bluetooth.Once setup is completed, you'll be able to easily receive and make phone calls and text messages, as well as to read or send emails. Further, this watch has several useful preloaded apps, such as but not limited to, a calendar, a message reminder, a stopwatch, a Sports health monitor, a pedometer, a sleep monitoring function, a calculator, and an ability to listen to music. And, if that's not enough, it comes with a 1.5M pixel camera so that you can take selfies if you are so inclined. In addition, those with an Android phone will also have access to functions like: notification push, remote capture, anti-lost. (These functions are not currently available on IOS because Apple has not made the IOS app available at this time) Oh yes, let's not forget that since this is first and foremost a WATCH, it enables you to see the time brightly and easily from three different watch faces that you can switch between simply by tapping the interactive screen.Since receiving this 007plus GT08 Smart Watch from the seller to test and review, I have been very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a Smart Watch that is attractive-looking, user-friendly and very reasonably priced. That being said, however, there are two suggestions I would make to the manufacturer that I think would make it even better to its customers. One is to provide an instruction booklet that is larger in size with larger font to make it much easier on the eye. While the booklet currently provided contains what you need to know, the font is so small that I, at times, had to use a magnifier app to be able to read it. The second suggestion would be to provide a way that the time could be displayed on the screen without having to press a button on the side of the watch to turn on the screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ABDCVPBDS04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZTDC88#wasThisHelpful","R9ABDCVPBDS04","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We received this camera in exchange for an unbiased review.Full disclosure-my wife and I are pretty technologically challenged!  This camera comes with a quick set-up guide that really makes the initial set-up a breeze.  We downloaded the app to my wife's IPhone and installed the camera with no problem.  The camera comes with a quick set-up guide but no user's  manual, which would be very helpful.  We tried to connect my IPhone to the camera as a second user but could not figure out how to do it so we called the Customer Service line. Chris Lee was extremely helpful and patiently walked us through the process.  He even followed up by sending us a link to a user's manual.  The quality and features of the Amcrest ProHD have been covered by previous reviewers and I agree with their praises!  We may not use all of the features-we really just like to watch our dog when we're out-but this product provides a lot of quality features for very reasonable price.

"Edward Klein, in Unlikeable, once again uses his no-holds-barred style of writing and his strong ability to accurately interpret the facts and information obtained from his ""in-the-know sources"" to provide readers with a very insightful expose into Hillary Clinton. Whichever way you lean politically, Unlikeable is a book all readers should read who are willing to have an open mind about the type of person who could be the next president.If you weren't already among the many people who feel Hillary Clinton is unlikeable and, more importantly, untrustworthy, those who read Klein's expose with an open mind will come to learn that Hillary entered the 2016 presidential campaign with a boatload of baggage -- including a tissue-thin resume as a U.S. Senator and Secretary of State, a mountain of scandals, widespread Clinton fatigue, a reputation for mendacity, no clear rationale for her candidacy, a brawler's reputation for foreign interventions and a very forbidding personality.Further, without going into detail, Klein makes the reader abundantly aware of  several other facts that generally go unmentioned in the media, including, but not limited to: (1) the intense dislike of Hillary (and Bill) towards the Obamas and the Obamas' at-least-as-strong dislike of the Clintons (e.g., one way Klein makes this evident is by Obama and his staff giving the FBI tacit approval to proceed with the Hillary private email server investigation; an issue, by the way, Obama --despite his public denials -- has known about throughout her period as Secretary of State); (2) Hillary's and Bill's use of the Clinton Foundation in unethical, if not illegal, ways; (3) Hillary's and Bill's serious health issues; and (4) Hillary's long-term knowledge of Bill's sexual exploits long before the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which she has been willing to condone and use to her advantage in exchange for Bill using his political connections and providing his political savvy to foster her ambition to be the president.Klein also points out that, through his research with many people who are/were ardent Hillary defenders, the arguments in support for Hillary being president boil down to three main points; and for each Klein presents an insightful point of view as to why these arguments are flawed. I'll leave it to you, the potential reader, to find out what these three arguments and their counter- arguments are. Instead, I'll just state the fundamental question Klein posits that Americans should ask themselves when they decide on whom to select as their next president, which is: ""Have our standards and morals declined to the point that we will elect someone who is so shameless that she lies without a tinge of guilt, and so untrustworthy that she engages in massive cover-ups?""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXYKMYQCVWDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621573788#wasThisHelpful","RIXYKMYQCVWDE","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If after having Obama as President for the past 6 1/2 years or so you think you know all you need to know about the type of person he is, perhaps you might want to rethink what you know -- or think you know -- and read Edward Klein's The Amateur. Admittedly, the time to have read this book was shortly after it was published in May, 2012, so that it perhaps could have given you food for thought regarding your decision to vote to (and not vote to) elect Obama to a second term as President.The Amateur is not a straight reporting of facts about Obama, but rather it is based on facts and information Klein obtained from nearly 200 interviews of people from both inside and outside the White House who came to know Obama well -- or thought they did. To paraphrase from the jacket flap, The Amateur is Klein's expose that pulls back the curtain of one of the most secretive White Houses in history, and reveals Obama to be a callow, thin-skinned, arrogant president with messianic dreams of grandeur supported by a cast of true-believers, all of them united by leftist politics and an amateurish understanding of executive leadership. If this portrayal upsets you or if goes against your beliefs about Obama as president, then I highly recommend that you avoid reading this book -- unless you are willing to keep an open mind to reading about some things you might not have REALLY known.Some of the things you'll get insight into in The Amateur are:Why the so-called centrist Obama is actually in revolt against the values of the society he was elected to leadWhy Bill Clinton -- who originally referred to Obama as an ""amateur--  loathes Barack Obama and tried to get Hillary to run against him in 2012,The spiteful rivalry between Michelle Obama and Oprah WinfreyHow Obama split the Kennedy familyHow Obama has taken more of a personal role in making foreign policy than any president since Richard Nixonwith disastrous resultsHow Michelle Obama and Valerie Jarrett are the real powers behind the White House throne.Whether you are or are not in agreement with Klein's (and others, myself included) referring to the President as The Amateur, I'll provide the author's rationale for doing so to help you decide if ""the shoe fits"" or not:""A president who is inept in the arts of management and governance, who doesn't learn form his mistakes, and who therefore repeats policies that make our economy less robust and our nation less safe. A man who blames all his problems on those with whom he disagrees (""Washington,"" ""Republicans,"" ""the media""), who discards old friends and supporters when they are no longer useful (Democrats, African-Americans, Jews), and who is so thin-skinned that he constantly complains about what people say and write about him. A person who derives no joy from the cut and thrust of politics, but who clings to the narcissistic life of the presidency.""I hope this review is of help in deciding if The Amateur is a book you'll want to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLWAJQOSFNJQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596987855#wasThisHelpful","RLWAJQOSFNJQL","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Swan Personal Scale (Not For Business Counting  hahaha that cracks me up that its so prominent on the package, as if its part of the product name!) is not one I will be using regularly.  I received the scale from the vendor to review in exchange for an honest, unbiased review and was excited because I was thinking about buying a new scale and the Ohuhu scale is sleek and attractive looking. Also, I was interested in trying this product because I've had good experiences with other Ohuhu products.Unfortunately, however, this scale is NOT a good replacement for the one I have...and I am glad I hadnt gotten rid of it yet!!!  First of all, it registers a different weight almost every time I step on it  even if its like 5 seconds apart!  And if I put it in different spots on the floor, I get different readingsVERY different!!!  On every scale I have ever had, the readings are sometimes different if I move it around because of imperfections in the floorbut this one gives WAY different readings.  Also, it gives much lower reading than my other scale and the scales in my gym.  There is always some discrepeancy, but this gives much lighter readings.  Which normally I would loveif I could fool myself!!!  But I cant so this scale will likely just collect dust in my bathroom or be discarded, sorry to say. Also, just a side note about the written instructions provided  not that you probably need any elaborate instructions  but the English is so bad in them that they are of very little help.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19VYYR8WRQPOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KZY52#wasThisHelpful","R19VYYR8WRQPOA","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without going into details of the plot, which can be read about in the Amazon Book Description above, I'll just say that Secrets Of State is an entertaining and informative thriller that pertains to a potential nuclear war between India and Pakistan that may be instigated by a group within the Washington, D.C. area.Palmer, a 20-year veteran within the U.S. Foreign Service (and the son of bestselling author, Michael Palmer), makes his knowledge of international politics and intrigue clearly evident in his second thriller. Secrets Of State slowly builds into a complex exciting page-turner, with pretty well-developed characters, interesting locales and enough plot twists to keep you in suspense about who the ""white hats"" are and who are the ""black hats."" Having said this, I should point out that a few times I found some elements within Secrets Of State seemed a bit hard to believe but that didn't really detract from my enjoyment. Further, I wish that Palmer could made his hero reach ""first and second base"" a little faster than it took him; but he had no problem getting his hero to ""round third and reach home plate"" at above average speed.I enjoyed Secret Of State and recommend it to those who enjoy international suspense thrillers and political thrillers. I now plan to go back and read Palmer's first thriller, The American Mission.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUMV58FVTAHIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165711#wasThisHelpful","RUMV58FVTAHIH","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are in the market for good quality, lightweight wireless in-ear headphones without having to break the bank, i recommend the Soundpeats Q8 wireless sports stereo earbuds headphones. The reasons for my recommendation are as follows:...They provide a rich, crisp sound quality -- even when exercising...They pair easily and quickly with your device...They fit snugly, yet comfortably in the ear/ear canal, and provide 3 sizes of cushions and ear hooks to allow you to find the one that fits best,...They work well to cancel out noises around you...They provide a speakerphone mode so that you can answer phone calls...They provide up to 6 hours of use on a single charge, and...They come with an attractive, ring-shaped box to make the headphones easy to carry when you are on-the-go, as well as for conveniently storing the headphones, its ear cushions and hooks, and its charging cable all in one small, yet roomy place.While I don't have any major complaints about these headphones, I do have a two minor Issues. One is that while its bass is acceptable, I would have preferred a stronger bass sound. The second is that the buttons on the headphone's spaghetti-like strap are a bit hard to push and to figure out by feel which button is which; and so, I found myself fumbling around a bit to pause them or to adjust the volume when I needed to.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer in return for an honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JDPSGU13MQRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RE0KUOK#wasThisHelpful","R3JDPSGU13MQRM","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"House Of Echoes is a very atmospheric ""scary"" reminiscent of the ""good old days,"" when ""scaries"" didn't have to be filled with vampires and the like to be suspenseful. Without going into detail about the plot, I'll just say that House Of Echoes is a tale of how a young family's dream of a better life by moving to an estate in a small village in upstate New York turns into a nightmare.To his credit, Duffy, in his debut novel, does a very good job in making the reader clearly feel that he/she is right there with the Tierney family every step of the way as they work to restore the sprawling estate, in their efforts to fit in with their new village neighbors, and as their lives start to turn into a living hell.This book just oozes with atmosphere!However, Duffy's focus on atmosphere tended to dominate this book, and resulted in this reader experiencing little ""first hand"" thrills and edge-of-the-seat suspense until the last quarter or so of the book. Put another way, Duffy kept the pace of the book in second and third gear for too long before shifting into fourth gear.Further, Duffy fills the book with characters that are serviceable enough to maintain interest in the story; but, in my opinion, they are not developed well enough to really care much about them. Further, when an author takes the time to describe how much the family dog is loved and then has it disappear, he should at least spend a little more time on creating some sense of emotion about it from the family members.Despite these flaws, I enjoyed House Of Echoes enough to consider reading a second book by Brendan Duffy to see if he has further developed his potential as a suspense writer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WW8UNGU2N8S8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178119#wasThisHelpful","R2WW8UNGU2N8S8","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Frontline Plus to control fleas and ticks on my 34 lb. French Bulldog for about five years and have found it to be an excellent but expensive product. So, when I was offered a free three-pack of Sentry Fiproguard Plus, which is positioned as having the same active ingredients as Frontline for less money, I accepted the offer from the Amazon Vine program.So far, after applying one application of the Sentry product, it seems to work as effectively as Frontline Plus in that, like with Frontline, my little man continues to be free from any ticks and fleas. However, this product has only been ""put to the test"" for one of the three treatments provided, whereas Frontline Plus has proven itself to be effective on my dog for five years. I will use the  two remaining applications of Sentry I have but, to be honest, I almost certainly will be going back to purchasing Frontline Plus.

It is a relatively lightweight canister and yet all the components are of much higher quality than the Electrolux machine I have been using.  The devil is in the details-an easily adjustable wand length, a very long cord, a convenient switch on the handle for the power component so that you can switch between hard floors and carpet easily and tools that store easily in the body of the canister.  Don't even get me started on the suction power!  You can adjust the suction from Level 1 to 5 and you had better keep small animals away if you are using the Level 5!

To be honest, I tend to shy away from gold tone bands but I consider this particular gold color and brushed finish to be well-suited to my taste.

"The Gembonics 3-port USB Car Charger is ideal for when you have the need to charge your smartphone, tablet or music players -- and particularly when you need to charge all 3 devices simultaneously.Its technology works by distributing the necessary charge to each device with its micro chip; and it automatically stops charging the specific device when it's battery is fully charged.

"Having read Susan Wilson's One Good Dog, The Dog Who Danced and A Man Of His Own, each of which I gave 5 star ratings, I was concerned about how her latest book, The Dog Who Saved Me, would measure up. Well, I have to say that while I wouldn't rate it quite as high as those books, I do consider it to be a very good book that deserves a large reading audience.I know when some of my Amazon Friends see I've written another review about a book that features a dog, they are going to dismiss this book from their consideration (and possibly me as well). That will be their loss. But if you are a ""dog person"" do yourself a favor and put The Dog Who Saved Me on your reading list. I think you'll find it to be a well-written, emotional book with a cast of characters -- of course, one of which is a dog you'll really care about (and perhaps even more than about the people characters) -- that will hold your interest from the first to the last page.I won't summarize the plot as you can find out what The Dog Who Saved Me is about from the Amazon Book Description above. I'll just say that it is a heartwarming novel about a very special dog and the human lives he touches. I think you'll find that this book will make you feel things that at times will have you laughing and at other times feeling quite sad (perhaps to the point that you might want to have some tissues by your side). And, very importantly, it will make feel glad you decided to read this moving book. Is it perfect? No. Is it predictable? Yes. But, I think your overall reaction, like mine, will be ""who cares.""Now, having given The Dog Who Saved Me the praise it deserves you might be asking yourself -- why the 4 star and not the 5 star rating that I gave to Wilson's other books? The reason has to do the level of intensity in regards to plot development, character development and narrative. For me, in each of Wilson's other book, her plots and narrative were even more emotionally-charged and touching and her characters were even more fully developed -- to the point that I still remember them long after having finished the books. Please do not take this as a ""knock"" against The Dog Who Saved Me. It is not intended to be. What it is intended to do, if you haven't already done so, is to encourage you to not only read The Dog Who Saved Me but to read Wilson's three previous books mentioned at the beginning of this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOZ27Z5A3E66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250014344#wasThisHelpful","RIOZ27Z5A3E66","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Similar to other silicone gloves my wife and I have used, we haven't had a chance to try these Kitchonics silicone gloves on the barbecue yet because of the cold weather here, but they have performed very well in our oven. We have able to touch the oven racks at 400 degrees with no problem at all. We have also found them to come in handy for opening tight jars, as the silicone provides a good non-slip gripping surface. I have rather large hands and these gloves are fine for me-my wife has small hands and she tells me the gloves fit her comfortably as well. Further, in addition to these gloves being very functional, my wife (and I admit that I do too) find the orange color to be quite attractive.They are easy to keep clean with soap and water-unlike fabric gloves that often stain or char.All in all this is a product that we didn't know we needed but are glad we received!

"When Kootek offered to send me a complimentary sample of their Foldable Monopod Selfie Stick in return for a honest, unbiased review I accepted their offer because I wanted to see how it compared to the The Original Selfie Stick brand I had been using. I had considered the Original Selfie Stick to be good enough but far from flawless. Mainly I found that stick to be a bit cheaply made overall, to do just a so-so job in terms of the stick staying firmly in place when extended its fullest or even close to its fullest, to being adequate AT BEST in securing holding my iPhone 6 in its holder -- especially when extended, and to its bluetooth remote shutter button being a a bit annoying since it is a separate piece that slides onto the handle and, thus, doesn't always stay in the place where you want it to be.My in-going expectation was that this Kootek Selfie Stick was probably not going to be any better than The Original Selfie Stick. I couldn't be more wrong!Since I started using the Kootek product I have been very satisfied with it in every way possible. By that I mean:...It is very simple to assemble, charges quickly and pairs almost instantly with my iPhone 6...It is well-designed and constructed, in that even when extended the tubes stay in place without spinning around due to the weight of the phone. In addition, its holder  keeps the phone very firmly in place at all times...Its silicone-based handle fits comfortably in the hand and makes it easy to grasp without concern about slipping; and...Its bluetooth shutter (and pairing) button is built directly into the stick's handle and strategically placed, making it very easy to use even when the tubes are extended.Oh, and if these benefits don't convince you to strongly consider this Kootek Selfie Stick -- especially if you were thinking about buying The Original Selfie Stick -- you should know that it is reasonably priced and currently less expensive on Amazon than The Original (i.e, $15.99 vs $18.99)Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21AK3N67Y40FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVPR3CW#wasThisHelpful","R21AK3N67Y40FB","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are in the market for a waterproof bluetooth speaker to use in the shower, bathroom, beach or, basically anywhere where it where it would be at risk of getting very wet, the Aqua Audio Cubo speaker is the best of the three brands of waterproof Bluetooth wireless speakers I've used. The main reason the Aqua Audio Cubo is my preferred waterproof speaker is due to a combination of the following three factors -- sound, controls and design....SOUND: This speaker produces very crisp, rich and clear sound, and the highest sound quality of the waterproof speakers I have experienced -- keeping in mind that the sound quality of the other two brands is also very good....CONTROLS: The speaker pairs and connects with my devices super fast and its buttons are located in the center of the speaker's FACE, making it very simple to control your music, adjust the volume (which can be loud enough to hear from over 30' away) and to answer calls remotely and speak handsfree through its built-in microphone. Plus, it enables you connect to Siri (if you have an iPhone). Comparatively, while one of the other brand's sound quality was a close second to the Aqua Audio Cubo, I found the location of its controls -- which were placed around the SIDES of the speaker -- to be less user-friendly....DESIGN: I find the Aqua Audio speaker to be not only attractive but to have the most sleek design of the waterproof speakers I've used. Further, I like this speaker  because it is waterproof, enabling me to be able to listen to music whenever I want when in the shower without concern about it getting wet or falling down; although both of the other speakers I've used are comparable to the Aqua Audio Cubo on this feature. I should mention that a minor limitation about all three suction-based speakers is that I am unable to adhere the speakers to my textured shower wall tiles because they only stick well on smooth/flat tiles/surfaces. This, however, is really not a big deal as the speakers adhere very well on my shower door.Highly recommended.I received this speaker from the distributor in return for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAXMKKNXDPR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15BQCG#wasThisHelpful","R2XAXMKKNXDPR2","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are in the market for a waterproof bluetooth speaker to use in the shower, bathroom, beach or, basically anywhere where it where it would be in risk of getting very wet, the BLUBOON speaker is one that deserves serious consideration. The main reason I like it is because it is waterproof and can be kept suctioned to my shower door, enabling me to be able to listen to music whenever I want when in the shower without concern about it getting wet or falling down. The other primary reason why I like this speaker is that it has an easy-to-use handsfree microphone built in so that I can receive telephone calls in the shower if I choose. While I would have preferred to keep the speaker on a shower wall instead of the shower door, I was unable to do so because the suction cup only adheres well to smooth/flat tiles/surfaces; but my tiles have a slight texture to them. This is not a big issue for me but it is a factor you should be aware of if you consider this product (or, it seems, other suction-based speakers as well, as I've experienced this same issue with another brand of waterproof speaker).The speaker paired very easily with my iPhone and Ipad and connects quickly once paired. Further, its sound quality is very good, sounding crisp and true for a speaker in this price range.While all of its control buttons work well, I would have preferred that they were located in the MIDDLE of the speaker, allowing easy access to whatever you want to control (e.g., on/off, volume up/down, answer/disconnect calls. etc.).  rather around the SIDES of the speaker so that they were easier to get to.

"The BLUBOON Tempered Glass Screen Protectors I've used have convinced me to never go back to using the plastic film type of screen protector ever again. And, while I don't have experience using any other brand of glass screen protector against which to compare the BLUBOON protector, I can't imagine any other brand performing more satisfactorily than BLUBOON.My high degree of satisfaction with this protector is due to the following reasons: It is very easy to apply and enables you to do so without having to worry about air bubbles, it has protected my iPhone 6 against scratches and dust, it does a very good job in resisting finger prints and smudges, and, perhaps most important to me, it provides a sensitive touch function to assure touchscreen accuracy.The above being said, I prefer the BLUBOON 0.3mm thick protector I've also used to this 0.18mm thick protector simply because of its being almost twice as thick, and thus being potentially almost twice as likely to protect the screen from breakage.I received a sample of this product (as well as the 0.3mm glass protector) from the vendor in return for an honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KO4ABMICHIHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGL96AG#wasThisHelpful","R2KO4ABMICHIHS","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are in the market for good quality, lightweight wireless in-ear headphones without having to break the bank, i recommend the Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0  Headphone. The reasons for my recommendation are as follows:...They provide a rich, crisp sound quality -- even when running or exercising...They pair easily and quickly with your device...They fit snugly, yet comfortably in the ear/ear canal...They provide a speakerphone mode so that you can answer phone calls, and...They provide up to 6 hours of use on a single charge.While I don't have any major complaints about these headphones, I do have a few minor Issues. One is that the buttons on the headphones are a bit hard to push and to figure out by feel which button is which; and so, I found myself fumbling around a bit to pause them or to adjust the volume when I needed to.

"I had been very much looking forward to reading The Whites, as I have been a big fan of Richard Price's books for many years. I considered his books -- such as Clockers, Freedomland and Lush Life -- to be  symphonies in words. This is because I found that they masterfully captured the sounds, sights and smells of NYC in such a way that I always felt I was right there alongside the victims, perpetrators and police detectives investigating whatever crimes that were committed as the plots unfolded. Further, I always found his books to be filled with very well-developed, complex, real-world characters. While I typically prefer books that move at a fast pace, Price's books have been an exception to that general rule, as I tended to savor his very rich, well-written narratives and dialogue,  even though they often tended to come at the expense of lots of action scenes.I won't describe the plot of The Whites as this can be found in the Amazon Book Description above.  I'll just say that after reading The Whites I think I understand why Price used the pen name Harry Brandt.Unlike my past experiences with Price's books, I found so many of Brandt's sentences in The Whites to be so lengthy/ wordy/ complex that I often had to repeat reading them in order to be able to comprehend what what I was reading. This happened enough times that my head at times felt like it was spinning. Further, there are so many characters in The Whites -- each with their own sub-stories -- that I felt I needed a scoreboard to keep track of who they are and what they are doing. The combination of these factors resulted in The Whites being such a slow-paced, convoluted  book that it became a chore for me to finish it; and, thus, a book in which I was quite disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MYG66LE2SDRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805093990#wasThisHelpful","R1MYG66LE2SDRE","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Friendship Of Criminals marks Robert Glinski's debut as a novelist. Without going into detail about the book, it, in short strokes, is positioned by the publisher as a crime thriller that explores the various criminal factions of Philadelphia when the Italian mob threatens Port Richmond's crime boss. This positioning motivated me to put this debut crime thriller at the top of my mountain of books waiting to be read. As it turned out, my overall opinion of The Friendship Of Criminals is that its strengths are offset (if not outweighed) by some weaknesses that prevent me from considering the book to be anything more than just a ""fair read.""On the plus side, Glinski demonstrates a very strong ability to convey the seamy side of Philadelphia, as well as for developing rich, full, interesting back stories for all of the primary characters and many of the secondary characters. However, while not a major factor, I felt that Glinski portrays two of his major characters (i.e. Polish crime boss Anton Bielakowski and long-time associate Sonny Pitts) in such a way that I tended to think of them as being a lot older men than they actually are (i.e., Anton being aged 60 and Sonny a little younger).On the other hand, I strongly felt that Glinski spent such a large portion of his pretty short novel (i.e. 265 pages in the ARC I read) in developing the back stories of so many characters that they often got in the way of his ability to create a fast-paced, attention-holding, thrilling plot. After all, the book is billed as a crime THRILLER; yet, for me, The Friendship Of Criminals was virtually devoid of what I consider to be thrills and ""in the moment"" excitement. It isn't until the last few pages of the book that any real action occurs; and, even here I felt that the action that occurs is, for the most part, unsuspenseful and predictable.I hesitate to recommend The Friendship Of Criminals because of my mixed reactions to it. Although, Glinski shows enough potential as a writer that I would be likely to consider reading his next book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNMH75RQXXB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049962#wasThisHelpful","R1DNMH75RQXXB2","A2CVXUY1EYQGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CVXUY1EYQGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this from Amazon back in Nov. 2014 and it still looks brand new.  I use it almost daily for both my Irish Draught warmblood(17.1 hands) and my Saddlebred(16.1 hands).  Something isn't quite right about the proportions and the crank noseband(yes, this has a crank but I do not use it to the point of leverage).The leather is decent quality in that it has held up very well but it hasn't *softened* up as much as some of my more expensive bridles would have with a year of regular cleaning(the old fashioned way- with a bar of glycerin soap and conditioning with neatsfoot oil- not the all-in-one or spray on stuff)(NOT that there is anything wrong with those- whatever works for you!  I spent alot of time in a barn when I was a kid where we got smacked with a crop if we didn't clean our tack to our trainer's liking, LOL).  Anyhow, usually lots of glycerin soap and oiling softens almost anything up eventually so we'll see.  I love some of my other HDR tack immensely.

"So I just recently reviewed the iHealth and now the Up2 and I have to say I LOVE the Up2.  I like the interface on the phone and I find it tracks my actual sleep as opposed to just lying in bed alot better than the iHealth does.  I have no idea how or why but it does and since I have sleep issues, this is an important feature to me.It, like iHealth, integrates with Apple Health but does not offer so many features as the iHealth.I do like that you can set reminders through the phone app- or alarms- that cause the band to go off and vibrate.A big 'pro' is the sleek look but while my iHealth is bulkier and needs charging more often, it does have a face that gives you info like time, date and your info so far for the day without having to go onto your phone.The UP2 only requires charging every 10 days or so while I'd say my iHealth only lasts about half that time.Both do a far better job of tracking EVERYTHING than the Misfit which I liked while using it until I got the iHealth.Also, I like that the iHealth is compatible with a scale, pulse ox monitor and bp cuff- but not everyone is looking to track their health to that degree on a regular basis.I really like the sleek design of the UP2 and if I had to pick, it would be my present choice of fitness trackers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QS2XE7BDC73M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2QS2XE7BDC73M","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was totally skeptical when I read that this little thing could heat a whole room.  I've had space heaters for the bathroom before or to keep my feet warm when at work in an over-air-conditioned building.  THIS LITTLE THING IS TOTALLY AMAZING!  I homeschool my daughters in our family room and while 'school is in session' I pull a set of curtains closed over the open, step-down into the room.  The other morning was pretty chilly so we had the ""Dr."" running.  I guess I didn't realize how effective it was until I slipped out to the rest of the house to find it still chilly (chilly enough for me to throw on a fleece while doing laundry in what is usually the hottest room in the house).  When I went back into the family room, it was warm and toasty!  And the family room is probably close to 300-something square feet with 8 foot ceilings and wall-to-wall windows that don't get the morning sun.I am the family 'lizard'- always freezing.  I sleep with an electric throw, even through most of the summer and cashmere is my best friend.  I eventually had to turn the heater off because it was getting TOO toasty.  I'm going to be using it to take the chill off the master bedroom this winter because it is the room that is least efficiently heated by our furnace for some reason. (Yes, I know, we should have the ductwork checked but we just had a new furnace and ducts installed and they said it is because the vent is the one furthest from the furnace).I am impressed!  This does have a safety switch that shuts it off if it gets knocked over but it does get hot on the front and I wouldn't run it near anything that could catch fire or melt(like cords).  I also wouldn't leave it unattended AT ALL- if I use it in my room, I will use it to heat the room up before bed then turn off before going to sleep.From a heating perspective, I am blown away by how much this can warm a room in a short time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXXC03Y2EMFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DZ2V6C#wasThisHelpful","R3TXXC03Y2EMFD","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have gotten excellent results from these products- so much so that I bought larger sizes of the peels I really liked and worked for me and passed this along to a friend and coworker.  We work at a ranch and often spend hours out in the broiling sun.  I've had huge discoloration, lots of spots already but these products have completely changed the quality of my skin.I have dark brown hair and eyes and a very fair olive complexion.  For me, the TCA peel has worked absolute wonders!  When I first put it on before bed, I woke the next morning with massive discoloration and darkening of my face.  I almost freaked out and then went on to apply PREMIUM Argireline Botox Alternative Anti-Aging Serum  The BEST Anti-Wrinkle Cream On Amazon For Results  With Vegan Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin A  Perfect For Eyes + Face  Acetyl Hexapeptide 3  Made In The USA  Try Risk Free NOW!, my Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer, 2 fl. oz. and a heavy duty sunblock- Christian Dior Diorsnow White Reveal Uv Shield Spf 50 and decided to wait to freak out.  By the end of the week all the discoloration had sloughed off(I peeled like I had a bad sunburn) leaving my skin far more even-toned, softer and many of my spots were gone or lightened.  I ordered this in a large size and intend to do again.I've had laser work done and not only was it far, far more expensive- it was less effective.  I do recommend following the instructions and doing a spot test as this is clearly strong stuff and you don't want to damage your skin if your skin is not compatible with the product.Working at a ranch and instructing lessons and riding in an outdoor arena, I have had a huge amount of sun exposure and only recently have gotten serious about protecting my skin.  A peel def. encourages me to slather on the sunblock and wear a hat.  :)  I do follow the instructions to a 't' and recommend anyone who uses these products do the same as they are SERIOUS.

"Beautiful!  I hardly ever take this bracelet off!  The gemstones in my bracelet are very much the same color as shown on the website but I'm not a jeweler so I can't really speak to color and quality.  I do clean it periodically to maintain a 'brand new' look.  I highly recommend.I have about a 7"" wrist- maybe slightly smaller and this fits me well with a little room to spare.  There is not a clasp such that you can vary the size so if you have a larger or smaller wrist, this may not be for you.Another piece I get lots of compliments on.  I purchased a London Blue Topaz bracelet from one of the larger sellers on AMAZON (ahem) and though it was pretty, the stones are extremely lighter than the stones in my bracelet and are noticeably not 'real'- despite the higher price point.  I think the stone color and quality of bracelet(I am a horseback riding instructor and horse trainer and I wear this to the ranch constantly and it has never fallen off or been damaged in any way, despite how rough I am on my jewelry) are well worth the price point!

"Fantastic product!  I recently had a TCA peel and I used this twice daily under my moisturizer and I felt like it made a huge difference in my healing time.  It only takes a few drops and I could feel my skin just soak up the moisture.  Even while my skin was PEELING I got compliments on how soft my skin looked and one of my coworkers said I was 'glowing'.  Normally, I try to hide and not look like a giant snake person shedding my skin- It's been a long time since I've received that sort of compliment.  I will be continuing to use this as part of my daily regimen.  Compared to the other 'anti-aging serums' out there, I think this is a fantastic deal and I would highly recommend giving it a try before spending a ton of money on something that will give you lesser results.I did receive a free sample of this product but I plan to continue to purchase and I am going to take some before & after pics.  I will update this review in a few months and hopefully can display what I feel certain will be excellent results!

Some people have complained about color fading but I find if I wear something regularly, I polish it and it returns to looking like new.This is probably horrible advice so proceed with caution, but I use an old toothbrush and a tiny bit of toothpaste to polish the gemstones and they sparkle and shine afterward.I've had this for several months now and so far not a single problem.Absolutely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCI5DBJJW7S48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EH6SA0#wasThisHelpful","RCI5DBJJW7S48","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm in heaven!  I love to make strawberry jam every year and everyone loves my strawberry jam so I make 30-40 pints of it.  I get the strawberries fresh from a fruit stand in Watsonville, rush them home and start making multiple small batches, over and over again.  The most time consuming aspect of all this has been hulling the strawberries in the past.  Then I found this little gizmo and voila!It's actually cute, too!Most importantly, it makes the hardest part of going through and hulling flats of strawberries about a bazillion times easier and faster.  I am ordering more as some of my girlfriends want to 'jam' with me and I thought this would be a sweet little gift for them to help them on their way to making their own strawberry jam.I might even jam more often now that it isn't such a pain in the rear!5 stars.  I love my strawberry huller.  If you try to take it away from me I will pinch you with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WN3DWCIUQE0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XOHZWC#wasThisHelpful","R2WN3DWCIUQE0I","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One week.  That's about the amount of wear you'll get out of this.  I thought these were super cute and ordered one in each color. I thought they would be a sweet little surprise for my two daughter's and then one for me and we would all have matching rings! I got them on a deal and now I know why.  The 'silver color'  which clearly states ""925 silver"" in the description, literally RUSTED on my daughter's finger.  My 'rose gold' color ring, within a week has lost all the ""rhodium"" plating around the ring and turned silver color.  Even better was the green color it turned my finger!My oldest daughter is still away at camp but I'm not holding out hope that her yellow gold plated ring will be any better.The old adage proves true once more: you get what you pay for!!Stay away from these unless you just want to throw away money.I recommend looking for jewelry under the brand name peora- so far I haven't been able to go wrong!!

"Super cute and homey looking.  These make great jam jar labels and my daughter also uses them to label her homemade bath and beauty products she stores in mason jars.Goes through the laser printer fine but I think it adds an extra special touch to use a nice pen and handwrite on these labels.The labels are very true to the picture.  You do have to adjust your printer settings.  My labels did not come on a full, regular sized sheet of paper- but Avery provides the specs.  Fairly small, so don't expect to get much more than a title on these labels, i.e. Strawberry Jam.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGGTTCU7M1PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VEE3O#wasThisHelpful","R1GGGTTCU7M1PN","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fairly well-made shower curtain.  It has a waffle texture to it- meaning it has raised and lowered squares (stitched diamonds actually) in an alternating pattern.The grommets are 'metal' but desn't state on the actual package what kind so don't expect them to last forever.100% polyester and made in China.  The bottom is *very* slightly weighted with magnets.A curtain like this, I usually treat and then use as the inner liner to a two-part liner.  I like this so you don't get get a big, nasty plastic shower curtain hug from a breeze or someone opening the door.I wish I could provide you more info but there just isn't all that much to tell about a shower curtain.  3 stars because if you look, you can find cotton, made in the USA ones in the same price point.

"Roughly, 3 out of 4 of our Gro-ables survived and were 'fruitful' so technically I would give this product, eh, 3.5 stars here but am upgrading to 4.  Here's why:I would have down-graded to 2 stars because, come on, it is Miracle-Gro, and they are like the Mattel of the backyard gardening world: they want you to buy their plants which I SWEAR are genetically modified to DIE if they aren't fed and watered with their special GM plant food and plant-water-additive-gunk.But I am almost inherently intrigued with these cute little gro-able, self-contained, practically-jumps-on-your-plate-for-you-straight-from-the-garden-its-so-easy veggie and herb growing pods.  You can literally pick a spot in your garden or a spot in your pot or even just a cute little pot and dump in some soil prep or some potting soil and voila! stick in your gro-ables and insta-garden!!  IT is so CUTE!  Add a star for cute!!!I did it with my kids and they had so much fun they actually put down their hardware to which they will soon via will-to-power be bio-connected and we did this totally amazing thing:  we opened our mouths and these weird garbled noises came out which are apparently words which we strung together into sentences.  I think we might have had a REAL LIFE, IN PERSON, CONVERSATION while planting our gro-ables.  This could be a fun family thing to do together!  Add another star!!The cherry tomatoes popped out like they were really trying to live up to their name and grow into a tree.  Kids eating fresh vegetables they planted and grew themselves.  Well, holy mackerel.  Who knew my kids actually liked tomatoes?  Nobody because they never tasted a real, honest to goodness tomato that THEY GREW before.  Even the organic ones at a stand don't quite compare!  They didn't grow where our very own cat fertilized them!!!  Add another star!Grrr... Lettuce is not happy drought riddled California with temps in the 80's and 90's and no relief in sight.  Maybe they will pop up later when it cools off but I'm guessing not. *sigh*  You can make all the veggies and herbs grow some of the time, and some of the herbs and veggies grow all the time, but you can't make all the herbs and veggies grow all the time... remove one star.BTW- I did get one set off Amazon from Vine to review but I also purchased two sets locally, one for each of my daughters to set up and our results were pretty even across the board.  We did get some lettuce but not much, some of the cilantro started bolting but we caught it in time and set up some shade and gave it more water.  The sweet peppers haven't come close to maturing but the cukes and zukes are going nuts and as always the zucchini we will be sick of by the end of summer.  I love growing tomatoes here versus back in Washington where we had to baby them through the end of July(course that was 15-20 years ago) until it got hot enough- they go crazy here.All in all, if you are looking for an easy way of gardening from seed, I recommend these little guys but remember you are probably getting a highly genetically modified product if that bothers you.  It doesn't bother me as I'd rather have GMOs- which, btw, have been around forever, than a bunch of toxic pesticides and fertilizers used instead because the plants are not resistant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXN7LZEYOCQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P99KHUU#wasThisHelpful","R3MXN7LZEYOCQU","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These supplements were like a little miracle for me!  I have a problem absorbing certain vitamins and minerals, especially calcium, magnesium and vitamin D(this company also makes a Vit D supplement).  My doctor advised me over time and several trials that I would need about 2.5 grams of calcium supplements a day.  This provides 1 gram per serving(which is 4 caplets).  It still means swallowing a handful of pills but before I had to swallow 4 pills to get 350mg or 500mg of JUST calcium and this also provides the much needed magnesium.Citrate versions are also much easier to absorb.  The proof is in my lab work - my calcium and magnesium levels are getting on track and my PTH is going down!A word of caution: when you start taking any kind of calcium/magnesium supplement, work your way up slowly.  I find they are about as effective as Immodium, if you know what I mean.  Increase your fiber intake- seriously.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG7R1MU4WXL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJS67TS#wasThisHelpful","R3BG7R1MU4WXL7","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's okay is a good way to describe it.  I was pretty happy with it in the beginning!Things to like:  **solid state drive!  Awesome, fast start up, autosave actually results in recoverable documents with minimal losses.  I'd take solid state and less memory over a great big drive with lots of memory that gets hot and usually ends up with a noisy or malfunctioning fan.  **touch screen!  Maybe not as useful for some, but makes it much easier for iOs users to move around(I am klutzy going between operating systems with the whole track pad click-vs-double-click stuff).  The touch screen is just cool and gives it that whole tablet feeling.  **portability!  Small and lightweight, this seemed like the optimal compromise between a full-blown laptop and a tablet.  It doesn't have much battery life, but enough to get through most kids after-school activities.  Also, with a smaller drive it kind of forces you to get out there and use the cloud resources you have available to you.  They are many!Not thrilled about:  **battery life is short and what worries me is that it isn't clear whether the battery is easily changed out or not.  It would require opening the entire back of the computer.  I think at this price point, the idea is that as battery life shortens, use your cord more and when the battery is kaput, so is the machine.  I am not a fan of throw-away stuff.  I'd prefer something a little higher quality that will last longer- especially given that it is mainly designed for getting on the internet and lightweight applications- it seems more like a terminal than anything else and as such, it should last a while since it is mostly just for interfacing with things that will be changing and upgrading out on the internet.  Just my .02.  **It's pretty wimpy.  A 3 foot fall onto carpet resulted in a big crack in the screen and one corner of the screen spiderwebbed.  It still functions fine but basically, my daughter nudged this off the edge of her very short bed onto the rug and the screen really got messed up.I did not find the hinges flimsy but I also did not find myself wanting to use this as a tablet.  I used it for a bit then went back to my regular computer while it got passed on to my 12 year old.  She can type like the wind on the keyboard that fits her small hands well.  I do think this would be a decent choice for a less expensive computer for schoolwork, etc. for a kid IF you install a really good screen protector and put a good case around it, which I failed to do quickly enough to avoid a snap*crackle*pop incident.  *sigh*","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TL6HZ45BQB02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REWQNXK#wasThisHelpful","R2TL6HZ45BQB02","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To die for, my lovelies!  This makes the best fruit-infused tea ever!  Great for mixing up a little lemon and mint in the ice water, too.  I have next to try a little fruit puree in the water but am waiting on the local fruit to sweeten up a bit.It is glass and fairly heavy but still has a delicate feel to it.  This is NOT a French Press as you cannot depress the plunger, it just has the french-press looking disc at the top to act as a very effective strainer.Quite tall, so you might need a special shelf for storage.  Handles hot and cold water with no problems and honestly, I so prefer my drinks made in a glass pitcher rather than knowing they came from a plastic bottle or pitcher somehow.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems fresher somehow.  Great for brewing iced tea.

"Love it!  These are practically a necessity to have around.  My husband is not the 'handiest' of persons around the house so alot of the little fix-its at home and the ranch fall to me.  My Tacwise staple gun sees quite a bit of use- I guess some people are tape-it people, but I'm a staple-it person!The 1/4 staples are great for temporary things like tacking up a sign or plastic sheeting, etc. while the 9/16 staples I used for reinforcing wire mesh covering some of the vents inside the attic(don't need any critters skittering around up there, *shudder*).  A couple of the medium-larger sized ones and some weather stripping worked great to tidy up some wire(I used the weather stripping over the wire so the staple wasn't rubbing against the wire- and yes, I know they MAKE specific staples already insulated for this purpose but 1. mine are better and 2. I didn't have to buy a whole other set of staples and staple gun- I just used what I had here.  :)  I'm handy like that and stuff.  Heh. )Off the bat- the only thing I might change is the packaging- but for the price point... I guess you can't expect it to come in a cute little box with drawers or anything.  As it is, I store my staples, nails, screws, etc. by material/use and size/gauge in little recycled jars- mark the jar and the lid except for the nails for my nail guns which just stay in their boxes for obvious reasons.  I try to color code sharpie and mark the tool/bit kits and then the 'ammo' for said tool so anyone in the house can figure it out.Just like I've taught both my daughters to cook, use knives, boil water, etc. since they were old enough to handle it, I've been introducing them to power tools and how to be safe and effective with them (my dad is a contractor and taught me the same so I am proud to say my daughters are not afraid to use a circular saw or a nail gun nor am *I* afraid of them using tools in the appropriate circumstances).  Even if you are NOT tool savvy, though, a staple gun is super manageable and you can get alot of mileage out of it.  If you are artsy/craftsy, look up staple gun projects on Pinterest.  I got a used dining room set when I was in college that was cherry- Queen Anne style.  When my kids were little they destroyed the white fabric seats.  Staple gun to the rescue!!  I reupholstered those babies in an afternoon!!!  I found some beautiful RED brocade upholstery that was marked down and the set looked like new!  It's time to do it again since it has been ten years and I think I want to refinish the wood, as well, so that will be Staple Gun's next big job.  :)Have fun with your staples!

"Very easy to install/uninstall.  Does not appear to have water flow regulator and thus the four stars.  Also, at this juncture, our guest bathroom has a sprayer head that is quite nice that can also come down to be used for cleaning/washing the dog, etc. and so I think we will switch back to that but this rivals our high end shower head in one of our other bathrooms.  The 'glass' is acrylic and does have that bluish glow to it which I think is pretty in the light but it depends, of course, on your taste and design.  But it does come as it appears.

"Same ingredients as other more expensive name brand but works as well for us and is far cheaper.We went through a terrifying experience last year where our Kitteh(yes, poor thing, that is her name) was subjected to the Kirkland Brand flea medication fiasco.  I was very, very, VERY skeptical to try anything but Frontline or Advantage on her after that.  One dose of the Kirkland stuff and she was scratching herself raw, licking and licking until, after bathing her twice gave her no relief, in the middle of the night I took her to the vet who was pretty much flummoxed, but gave her fluids, antihistamines, pain killers and kept her under observations.  I've heard other cats did not fare so well.I was very cautious with this and did a small test patch and waited a full day before adding the rest.  Sure, Kitteh gave me the ""I'm pissed at you"" look and stalked off, but no reaction.Despite the fact that she is kept diligently indoors, she likes to try and sneak out usually because some idiot solicitor decides to hold the door open and ""Oh, I think yer cat wants out"".  Ya think?  Ditto the pizza guy.  It's good to want things, especially when we live in a densely populated area with CREEPY neighbors down the street who got in trouble for catching cats in their backyard and putting them in a big cage in their garage.  I don't even wanna know...  but we also live on a busy road and I've had to be dragged out of oncoming traffic by my huband more than once sobbing hysterically over some poor soul that didn't quite make it all the way across.  Point is, try to keep Kitteh in as much as humanly possible but she escapes sometimes so I use flea control and then a flea comb on her when she does come back in.This stuff looks like it works well and I will add it to our rotation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8WUTS3R97SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CNXU#wasThisHelpful","RC8WUTS3R97SF","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent.  Not only do I use this for making mixed-media slide shows for my photography clients, my daughter also has the next earlier version that she uses to record private voice lessons(she is in the San Francisco Girls Chorus) and accompaniments.It is very easy to adjust the levels (very important when making digital recordings so as to not 'blow out' the sounds at either end).I can record onto different cards, into different folders and transfer them to my computer either via USB or with a card reader later to edit in Adobe software.My daughter simply hooks hers up to the computer and it is plug-and-play- she clicks on the file, just like she would if she had mounted a thumbdrive or whatnot and it transfers right into iTunes where she can put it straight onto her iPod to practice with or listen to later.I have conducted interviews and my daughter uses for directly recording the piano or vocals and we've never felt the need to purchase an aditional mic- although the options exist.  The mic head has multidirectional microphones that can be pointed in various direction.  I also find that I do not pick up alot of extraneous environmental noise- be it the humming from my recording lighting for my camera(a few off-camera 500W umbrella lights can make quite a racket which is why I prefer to use this to the mic on my Canon EOS 5D) or noise from moving the mic around.GREAT digital recorder for the price point.  I have purchased several over the years and tend to get a new one as they come out but I have ones that still work great from ages and ages ago and I am pretty tough on equipment since I shoot and record alot around horses and in environments like the beach, Ranch or *ahem* at WEDDINGS which can be way more dangerous than galloping over terrain in weather!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NVHZCNGKIPOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIXFBKG#wasThisHelpful","R2NVHZCNGKIPOL","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"really, I do.  Bet my life on these.These have worked out great for what we need them for.  I work on a horse ranch that backs up to thousands of acres of trail systems and so far we've yet, in more than a couple months of testing, been able to put enough space between groups or 'home base' to be unable to communicate.  This is extremely important since we don't always get decent cell coverage and we do go out for significantly long periods of time.We've used other radios- primarily Motorola that have worked out decently and these are heads above those.I highly recommend.  I do recommend ALWAYS testing your units before heading out somewhere where safety might rely on any sort of technology.  Always take extra- whatever you need- batteries, solar charger, whatever could stand between putting out that life-saving call should you ever need it, especially when headed out someplace unfamiliar or where there are rattlesnakes or both, yeah.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HS1O1CK4GB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHNSZO#wasThisHelpful","R18HS1O1CK4GB4","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you look at my profile you might guess I'm not a big FPS game player BUT... omg, this was SO MUCH FUN!  It still is!  It has been well more than a month since it has come into our household and we're all still playing it.  The big kids (my husband and I) are the worst of the worst!I like that there are so many choices and options.  I have not played any other Far Cry versions so cannot speak with any knowledge as to the comparison of this version to prior versions.  This game is lush, though.  The graphics are gorgeous, the setting is beyond anything I've yet seen in a video game before, and the sound really ties it all together.  All my own opinion, but, I'm significantly impressed.  It is like some crazy choose-your-own-adventure book come to life in the heart of some bizarre paradise-that-is-not-a-paradise.  I love the animals. You do have to kill them sometimes but there is def. a right way and a wrong way to go about that.  And, don't be a putz, don't try to kill the elephants, not by yourself at least.  Der.So, go on a treasure hunt... or  a safari...  take a tour...  do a side mission or a few...  I think the game really shines in multiplayer mode where strategy and knowing the style of the team you are playing for can make you or break you really adds to the adrenaline factor.This game will absolutely immerse you... engulf you, so don't start unless your calendar is pretty light for the next couple months.  :)  Def. a good bang for your video game buying buck in terms of playing hours and entertainment.  I found this very satisfactory.Parents- caution: your kids'll be fighting over this one (well, at least the ones you let play 'M' video games)!Okay, gotta go get some vitamin D now...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16JL3ZES205LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAED850#wasThisHelpful","R16JL3ZES205LN","A2IPC51HL9UUYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IPC51HL9UUYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This awesomely large snow globe belies its quality. It's too easy to dismiss globes since you can pick up cheap ones at the big ""marts"" and given the slightly higher price point of Lenox's I was expecting quality and wasn't disappointed. It has weight to it but comes well packaged in a retail box so arrived in perfect condition.The paint and gold shine. Perfect execution and combination of craftsmanship and skill. I assume it was hand done, if so it's really good.The ""snow"" is exquisite and are tiny particles, much smaller than the usual bits of plastic. This aids the effect hugely and the 3d scene of packages inside is lovely.In all this is awesome - bigger than you might expect but has details and accents that make it special.

"Very dainty lovely ""twisted"" silver heart piece that comes in a nice drawstring pouch and Hallmark box.The writing is nicely done although you may need glasses to read it - gaudy and big this is definitely not. The heart came in a baggy and the chain was in its own plastic bag. After I took the bags away I find out why they were there - the fine chain gets tangled incredibly easy and I would imagine it would not be hard to snap it when untangling if you're not careful.Of course none of that detracts from the beauty of this ""moebius"" heart and I'm sure it's one that would be well received by your loved one.

"I recently purchased a 2012 Layton Skyline. A huge forty foot trailer that weighs ten thousand pounds or so. Hauling it with my 2008 dodge would be a task on any given day but not being able to see around it added to the difficulty level. I toyed with those convex circular add on mirrors but thought that a band aid. If I'm trailing my home around the country for a while I need something safer and more effective.When DEDC contacted me about sending their extended heated powered mirrors in exchange for a review I jumped at it. They arrived in a plain brown cardboard box which was much bigger than I was expecting. I was also having some speakers delivered the same day and thought the box contained them!The mirrors themselves were completely intact thanks to the thick polystyrene packaging and getting them out ready for installation was easy.And these are big! I mean, once they're on the truck they look fairly normal but in the confines of my kitchen I was amazed at how heavy, sturdy and huge they are.They come with hardware and installing them was as simple as unbolting the factory mirrors and uncoupling the molex connector and putting the newer larger ones in the same way. The connectors means there's no wiring or splicing needed, no schematics to read - plug and play just like you were installing a hard drive in a PC.The bolts supplied fit perfectly and in ten minutes I had them on and they look factory installed. They function perfectly too, although do keep in mind that if your truck doesn't have powered mirrors originally then these won't have power either.My first ride out was perfect. Clear double vision set ideally so I can see the side of the camper and beyond. I cannot express how important these sorts of mirrors are when you're pulling a camper and am very happy I got them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5MGBB15B7P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V67X2H4#wasThisHelpful","RX5MGBB15B7P4","A4D5B7Q8A7PA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4D5B7Q8A7PA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Get straight to the point - I'm being hard on this projector for one reason - audio out, or lack thereof.Sure it's got great vivid images, the slightly lower resolution not withstanding. And it's quiet and supremely easy to set up at least as far as HDMI goes. The remote works for basic stuff and you can be throwing your media at a screen in seconds.It's not overly heavy but is still a chunk of weight for a small projector. I had it placed fairly even with the wall and the picture from a movie was perfectly serviceable.Setting it up to work with the network was not so smooth and so do expect a bit of fiddling if you're intending to use a laptop wirelessly. Getting images from my ipad was easy enough though. If you're familiar with network lingo such as ad hoc etc and know your wifi details you should get there. It's just not as smooth as it could be.The price is inline with others. A tad high perhaps but given the image quality it's fair.So the audio then. Well as others have noted there's no audio out! I looked, checked then went online and read the reviews. No, I'm not going mad there's no audio out, not even a 3.5mm jack.Sure you could intercept the audio from the HDMI cable I suppose but that doesn't do anything for wireless.Even if Epson only intended this to be an office executive projector, one for presentations etc then I'd still expect audio out.Flabbergasted it isn't there and can't recommend this for home or office use without it.

"Google chrome book reviewFive stars?A few years ago you may remember Web TV, a standalone internet ""computer"" for those folks unable or unwilling to learn what was then quite complicated computer systems. Ultimately Web TV was a failure even after being acquired by Microsoft and renamed MSN TV.So the idea of a fairly dumb terminal, a platform where computer use is crippled, the OS stripped down and only specific apps will run is nothing new.Obviously then this should shine a dim light on this Google Chromebook. I mean surely a proper laptop would be vastly preferable? Well yes and no.Let's look at the positives the first of which is the insanely low price that's so inexpensive even cheap lappies look pricey. Next the start up time. At four seconds no waiting around for Windows to boot and you can be surfing the web before a laptop's bios screen has disappeared.Now having said that, laptops can be left in sleep mode which speeds up their reboot time comparably - but that's only really useful if your laptop is plugged into power and not running off battery.Which brings us to battery life which on this little beauty is a claimed 8.5 hours and I'd say is fair.Of course, you can only run google chrome apps but there's so many useful programs out there that the limitation of such an environment is severely reduced and is getting better every day.This Chromebook is everything you could need in a mini notebook. The screen is crisp and clear with only the slightest off angle issues, the OS works simply and effectively and there's a huge amount of ready made cheap apps to keep you going.Do keep I mind that this is really an online tool, and functions are vastly reduced when not in a wifi hotspot but you can aim the same criticism against the much more expensive iPad.If this item was twice the price I would still give it five stars, and that's the highest recommendation I can give.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJGH34UD5ALN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7EB5XA#wasThisHelpful","R1HJGH34UD5ALN","A4D5B7Q8A7PA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4D5B7Q8A7PA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mom necklace reviewAs ever with amazon's fashion line of jewelry this nice little necklace piece comes in the same black coffin about three inches by two with a little blue pill tag for easy retrieval.It makes gifting this item a no brainer especially directly online to the recipient as it isn't wrapped in cellophane or dumped in a baggy requiring you to unwrap it before handing it over. It's good to go out of the box and looks great - albeit it very, very dainty. I wasn't expecting so little... precious... anything. It's like negative space. The heart is very thin but it does look lovely and polished and the cubic zirconias do their job shining and glistening.I could have lived without the MOM etching but it's so small it may be missed entirely. I don't like jewelry with names so much but if that's what you're looking for then you won't be disappointed.In all, a very pretty piece of jewelry, priced right and excellently presented.

"I agree with another reviewer that this was perfect for blending tan-less spots with tanned. In my case upper arms being pasty white but as a biker my lower arms have seen years of UV.As part of Vine I was also sent the mitt which I recommend for easier application. On my Caspar the ghost colored torso though I wasnt convinced this would pass as a real tan. It seemed rather orange and fake. But then every tanner has looked that way on me. Maybe I need to compliment it with real sun tanning or perhaps, and more likely, I'm just expecting too much given my Lilly white bits.I do recommend the product with the caveat that it's a fake tanner... So you can't really blame it for looking a tad fake. As a blender between sun tanned areas though it looks really good.

"The last time I owned a remote control vehicle was around 1971 and the car was tethered to the remote. So not really remote at all!How far we have come. This great ""rock crawler"" is much bigger than you'd expect and can go over some fairly large pieces of gravel and pebbles which, if you think in terms of scale, would be huge rocks for the size of the car. Charging takes just over half and hour and you get a healthy one to two hours or more of playtime. The unit itself is rechargeable so no worries on batteries there and the remote takes AAs supplied. Given today's tech I would imagine the remote should last a good while before replacing them.Speaking of the remote. I'm not a massive fan of the gun shape controller with a wheel on the side. Guess I'm just not used to it. I vastly prefer the analogue levers in higher end RC units but then I'm a console gamer so that would make sense.But no matter - for the price this is a stunning fun bit of kit.

"I recently received a cover for my big green egg and loved it, so when I was offered one for my patio heater I jumped at it too.This StorageSaver system includes a sack for easy storage, useful since mostly I will have it on the unneeded heater during the unused summer months But as we approach October I will be placing it on and off quite a bit so it's nice to have a bag to store it in to protect *it* as it sits outside when unused.The weather-resistant fabric feels like thick tent material but the whole thing folds up to form a bundle not much bigger than a thick phone book and when in place it forms a shroud that protects whilst looking nice. The vents prevent moisture build up - essential you don't have that and the handles allow for quick removal. The vents also aid in wind just passing through and not turning this into a zeppelin during windy days.In all this is a highly recommended way of protecting your patio heater investment, one that's been well thought out and works and looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK92KX7PD3CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4RLWOW#wasThisHelpful","R1BK92KX7PD3CQ","A4D5B7Q8A7PA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4D5B7Q8A7PA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Otterbox make some great cellphone cases. I remember when I first saw their tank defender or whatever it was called, a friend had it clad over his original iPhone 4. It turned it into a brick but it had a true Perspex screen overlay which still had touchscreen capability, was waterproof and he had even accidentally dropped it from his worksite over thirty feet - his phone was intact.However as phones got bigger but slimmer, people no longer wanted to clip their bulky phone to their belts, choosing instead for somewhat less protection in the shape of slimmer cases so they can still slip them in their pockets. Otterbox responded by making more streamlined cases at the expense of protection ultimately coming down to this case.And frankly I'm underwhelmed. Not because it doesn't do what is advertised - it has a nice softer case with sturdy skeleton, great honeycomb design and clearly has been well researched and constructed. I've no doubt that this is probably the best minimalist protection for your galaxy S6 currently available.No I'm underwhelmed because otterbox are asking a premium amount for a minimal product. I just can't justify the cost to the consumer versus the cost of manufacture.Sure it's got the name, it has the protection (as best you can get for a thin shroud)... it just feels cheap and I feel therefore it should be. At least less than the current price point. Keep that in mind when ordering.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CH6NPDZR6OL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0X3AOM#wasThisHelpful","R3CH6NPDZR6OL6","A4D5B7Q8A7PA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4D5B7Q8A7PA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Occasional gofer here but a very, very poor one. I have no real idea which club should be used despite years video game golf playing so any device that can aid my game is welcome.Out of the box this is much smaller than I was expecting. On my wrist it's positively tiny but that's not a complaint as it's practically weightless and unobtrusive - important for your swing not to be bothered by an electronic device.It recognized my course which with so many courses available wasn't surprising. Once on my way I set it to 'golf' and teed off. I did notice due to the landscape layout of the display I preferred wearing it upside down so I turned my hand up to read it. Ideally the display would need to be rotated 90 degrees to work best when worn as a traditional watch but I understand that might bulk it up to the point of being uncomfortable.Sadly I felt the user interface is what lets this device down. Lots of button presses and fiddling to glean the smallest amount of data. Why could the display itself be a button. Swipe interface to get the most pertinent info with least effort. Getting just the distance shot requires multiple presses and that's just not acceptable. Once a device takes more time to use than traditional methods then it's not serving its purpose in my opinion.Don't get me wrong. This does do what is claimed - front, centre, back to hole, pedometer, time played, distance etc all available and seemingly very accurate. Battery life is great and the display, although crude, is very clear despite some weird hieroglyphics that pop up requiring a visit to the manual from time to time. So I am giving it a reluctant four stars.  I just feel that with a cleaner e ink display and swipe touch interface this would be a worthy five star item and a hole in one. Recommended with caveats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGT5PCLXRSJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZYBMWC#wasThisHelpful","RHGT5PCLXRSJL","A4D5B7Q8A7PA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4D5B7Q8A7PA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Dell U2415 1920 x 1200 LED monitor with non-glare screen and very thin bezel is an excellent choice for nearly any use, Mac or Windows.The pixel density and size is the same as the discontinued Apple 24"" LED Cinema display.  Compared to that display, and the 27"" Apple LED Cinema that I have adjacent to the U2415, I actually prefer the Dell for these reasons (and granted that Apple has not updated their displays in about 3 years):1.  The color gamut feels equal.  Images and pages look better.2.  The non-glare coating is amazing.  It is not so dramatic that it detracts from crispness or affects colors.3.  There is less eye strain from the LED backlight.  I don't know if this is due to the technology in the Apple display vs the Dell, but the same image that strains my eyes from glare on the Apple LED display is relaxing at a matched brightness on the Dell.  Pretty much everything on the Dell is easier on my eyes.4.  The pixel density - pixels per inch - while the same as the discontinued 24"" Apple LED Cinema display, is greater than that of the 27"" Apple display.  For my over-60 eyes, I find the larger text on the Dell much easier to read.5.  USB 3.  Apple displays still have only USB 2 ports.  Ridiculous.  The Dell includes the device cable to enable these 5 ports.6.  DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort.  Both connections are on the back of the U2415.  The included miniDP to DP cable can be used by Mac people by connecting the DP end to the U2415 and the miniDP to their Mac.  For PC people, the opposite may be required depending on your graphics adapter.7.  HDMI x 2 works for input for some PC's, and of course for video sources including mirroring iPads/iPhones (via Apple's lightning to HDMI adapter).  Because of the 1200 pixel height (16:10 screen vs 16:9 HD content), HD video content will have black bars at the top and bottom.Note that the Dell U2415 does NOT include speakers, a microphone, or a camera, three features present on Apple monitors.  There is a speaker-out jack for audio arriving via HDMI and mounting slots for the optional Dell soundbar.The steel gray finish on the plastic stand does not match aluminum, but is close enough to look decent with a Mac.The thin bezel makes the monitor almost disappear and makes it ideal for multi-monitor situations.I was looking at some cheap President's Day sale monitors and quickly moved up to this monitor for the features above, as well as my requirement that the monitor stand be fully adjustable with height, tilt and swivel to align it with my other monitor.  I don't need to view things in portrait mode - although the U2415 worked beautifully while reading the local newspaper at near real-life size - but it's nice that the stand also supports rotation if I ever find a regular need for portrait orientation.I should note that the monitor was fine, but too bright out-of-the-box with Brightness and Contrast both at 75%.  I used System Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate to adjust the monitor for my display adapter and environment, and currently have Brightness at 52% and Contrast at 90%.Finally, just to be sure I don't sound like an idiot, my comparison to the 27"" Apple LED Cinema display is based on everything other than gross size and total pixels.  Of course that 27"" monitor has vastly more real estate and isn't at all an apples to apples comparison like the 24"" Apple LED Cinema.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQLQVBSCJ4PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZTKOQI#wasThisHelpful","R2SQLQVBSCJ4PH","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These easy to install replacement bulbs significantly improve night driving with our 2003 Chevy Suburban.  The stock bulbs provided a somewhat short, dim, yellowish view of the road ahead in our rural area where we typically drive without any streetlights or other illumination.  Brighter and whiter, these bulbs throw at least double the distance.  It does not match our newer vehicles, but is sufficiently better that we can drive knowing that we'll see animals entering the road and other night obstructions with adequate time to react.Our headlight lenses had previously been buffed/polished to increase transparency on their aged surfaces, which is also important for getting the best results if your vehicle is old like ours.My wife is delighted with the improved visibility.I'll update this review if the bulbs fail to last at least a year - as durability seems to be the primary weakness of these bulbs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJZ8QU735YD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M5Y720#wasThisHelpful","R1XJZ8QU735YD4","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avoid this OXO egg beater, as it does not last.  As others have reported, the white plastic clips that hold the beaters in place disintegrate with age.  After a year and a half, ours is going in the trash as it cannot be repaired and isn't recyclable.  The white plastic clips become brittle with age and just broke off without any pressure on our part. The washable parts have only been hand washed, even though the instructions say it is dishwasher-safe.  So, dishwasher heat and agitation has nothing to do with this material degradation.If you see one in person, you'll be tempted by the smooth and easy cranking and comfort in your hand.

But to give a lesser product the exact same name as a previous, more capable product is just Evil.

"The Diono Olympia looks like a good option for babies with a long life as it became a booster in older years.  It does not offer the extra infant cushions that the Rainier model comes with.  After working with this seat for hours in two vehicles, and having other parents compare it with their models, I cannot recommend this seat at all.The Olympia is heavy (27 pounds); consider it for semi-permanent use in a vehicle, not for moving between vehicles regularly.  It's no fun to carry even short distances.It's insanely complicated to perform the various attachment possibilities.  Adjustments are not well thought out at all in my opinion.  The harness buckle in the seat comes installed in the position for an older child.  Moving the buckle to another slot requires access through a path that does not work at all for larger hands.  Installing through the cover actually requires partially removing the cover to get the buckle through the slot in the foam which does not align with the fabric.My relatives who have had several children found the entire set-up overly complex compared with competing products, and found very little side cushioning and side impact protection compared to the products they had used.  Their children who are now  all under 7 years old and well below the 57"" height and 120 pound max requirements for booster mode were unable to fit in the seat at all.  It is too narrow for the younger ones... and an older one who is only 51"" tall could not fit because of the width of his shoulders.  Even in the product photos on Amazon, you can see the young girl has her shoulders curved forwards to fit.  Simply too narrow overall.In rear-facing position, the seat barely fit in our large SUV, a Suburban.  The top of the Rainier rested on the back of the driver's seat.

"This A&D UA-651BLE battery-powered blood pressure monitor is compact, portable and seems accurate.It can be used stand-alone, so don't feel that you must have a smart phone or tablet to use this.  There is a 6V external power plug in the back, but an adapter is not included. (The 6V cords that I have from other devices do not fit the plug.)There is an app for Apple IOS devices on the App Store and the manufacturer indicates that there will soon be an app for Android devices via Google Play, although no release date is known as of this writing.  Where I use the phrase iPhone/iPad below - that is because I can only test on those devices, not that the feature will be limited to those devices.  The monitor pairs with your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth but you should verify your device compatibility on the A&D web site.A HUGE feature for iPhone/iPad users not discussed by A&D:  their IOS app DOES offer to share its data with Apple's Health App (via ""Health Kit"") in IOS 8.1 and above!  It does not 'talk' to any of the other apps that I use - such as DigiFit, Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, etc - but most of them talk to Health (well, Fitbit doesn't...but it talks to others which then talk to Health).The IOS app in the App Store crashed on my iPhone 6+ running IOS 8.1, but the technical support team at A&D provided me with a beta version of version 4.1.2 of their app which has been able to sync fine.  The app still need a little polishing, but is good enough so far.  The pairing process does not follow the steps in the instruction manual or the app screen and looks like it is not successful, but it is.  If you have made multiple BP readings on the device without having the A&D app running on your phone/tablet, then the readings are stored in the memory of the UA-651BLE (up to the 30 most recent readings).  When you do eventually sync, all stored readings are given the date and time of the sync, not the date and time of the reading.  Every time I launch the A&D app, it indicates that it is syncing and downloading data from a scale, but I do not have one of their scales.  The App should be smart enough to not display that message if no scale is associated with the account.  If you accidentally do not get the cuff on tight enough, have the hose unplugged, etc., you'll get a reading of ""Err / Err / Err"" ... which should be ignored, but is synced to your app.  Almost any screen in the App can be sent to someone else via email, text, FaceBook or more  via a Share button In the app.  The History tab, though, gives a table of all of your readings and the only share option is to AirDrop or Mail the CSV file with the data.  Unlike the other Share buttons, there is no ""More"" option... which would have allowed the CSV file to be opened in Excel or Numbers, for example, or saved to Dropbox, etc.  A good thing on the History tab is that any row/reading can be deleted by swiping left.  Thus, that ""Err"" reading, or a reading that is really someone else in your household can be erased so that your graphs correctly reflect your readings.Weakness:  the cuff.  Prior to this A&D UA-651BLE portable battery-powered blood pressure monitor, I had used an Omron 10 Plus Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff (only USB connectivity) which I had also received as an Amazon Vine reviewer.  The cuff on the Omron is much easier to slip on by yourself than the A&D cuff, as the Omron cuff is completely open, but has an internal material in the cuff that wraps it firmly against the arm before the velcro is used to complete the attachment.  The A&D cuff requires inserting my hand through the opening, pulling it up to my bicep, and holding my arm against my body while I wrap and secure the cuff.Weakness: the built-in memory. The UA-651BLE can store up to 30 readings, and then begins deleting the oldest as new readings are made.  But, for stand-alone use, there is no means to page through these readings as with the Omron mentioned above.  For people who want a home BP monitor and yet don't have or want to deal with a smartphone, this limits the options for stand-alone use.  The only use of the stored readings is to be able to save them for future sync with a mobile app, assuming that no device was paired and syncing during the readings.Multi-user household?  The A&D US-651BLE has no way of distinguishing one person from another.  So assuming you can pair it with multiple devices (I cannot test because of the crash in the public version of their app) - you would have to have the A&D app running ONLY on the device that is supposed to receive the readings.  That is, if my wife wants her BP history on her phone in the A&D and Health apps, and I do as well, then only one of us could have the app running so that the appropriate phone will connect and upload the data.  If you allow the device to save readings for later transmission, you'll have no way of sorting them out to the appropriate mobile device ... they'll all just go to the next mobile device that has the app running at the end taking a new reading.  The Omron has a physical slider switch for users A and B and saves data for 2 users separately.  While that device requires a USB connection to upload data, the concept of a 'user' button is a good one.  Many of us have Wifi scales such as the Fitbit Aria Wi-fi Smart Scale that automatically detect which user is on the device ... and when confused (because weights are similar), lets you tap through a screen of user initials before the device uploads the data.  Because a lot of people have Wifi connected fitness devices such as that, I should emphasize the difference between that and a Bluetooth device such as the A&D monitor.  The Fitbit Aria uploads via wifi - no mobile device required - directly to the Fitbit ""cloud"";  from there, the readings are viewable in any web browser and are downloaded to any apps connected to your cloud account.  In contrast, your A&D US-651BLE readings are not transmitted remotely via a wifi/internet connection, but directly to one of your mobile devices IF the A&D app is running on that device.  The device uploads the readings to A&D's ""WellnessConnected"" web service so that any other connected mobile A&D App can see all of the same data.  There is currently no web login that I could find to view the readings stored on the A&D cloud.  (I do not want to suggest that there is anything 'wrong' or 'backwards' about how A&D is performing bluetooth and then cloud syncing... that is the same thing that happens with bluetooth heart rate montors and Digifit, and with Fitbit fitness trackers, too, for example.Bottom line:  Accurate, portable, very reasonably priced and with a 5 year warranty, the UA-651BLE is easy to recommend even without the associated app.  The IOS app - once debugged and improved - with its charting and sharing capabilities - particularly sharing with the Apple Health App for devices running IOS 8.1 and above - makes this a device worth considering for anyone who is into digital health monitoring.  A star is dropped because of the issues detailed above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19FO4XVJ877R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTE7CS#wasThisHelpful","R19FO4XVJ877R9","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like so many, I suffer from dry eyes.  So dry that I couldn't wear contact lenses.When my eyes are dry enough that they really bother me, including getting dust/debri in them that I cannot flush out due to lack of tears, Visince Tears Lubricant has been my 'go to' solution.  This 'Long Lasting' version is a slightly different formulation than the prior Visine product I'd been using, and is both soothing and lasting for me.

"I applied these door edge film strips to a Chevy full size pickup's front doors, which came without any factory protection.  The somewhat narrow width turned out to be perfect, allowing the strips to wrap without running into inside-edge irregular shapes in the doors.  The strips were also a bit longer than required, trimming being preferable to being too short.Even though I cleaned the door edge first and kept my hands away from the strip, there are still a couple of places where the adhesion did not result in complete transparency, so the appearance is a little off in those spots.  Also, where there was a crease/sharp bend in the door shape on the outside, the inside did not adhere well after wrapping.  Even slitting the material to let it lay flat did not get the inside to lay flat.Satisfied so far for the price, in spite of the above.  The key will be how long this holds up compared to the factory strips on our other vehicle.  I update my reviews regularly as needed, so if you don't see an update here, it means the strips are still going strong.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQ4PJC52AV2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOQHRH6#wasThisHelpful","R2IQ4PJC52AV2E","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You get what you pay for.  I have two Honeywell programmable thermostats that I purchased from Amazon a few years ago  -  Honeywell  RTH7600D Touchscreen 7-Day Programmable Thermostat.  The instructions for installation and usage for the Honeywell are crystal clear and well-illustrated, programming with the touchscreen (and no physical buttons and sliders like this Lux) is extremely easy and the shell has a solid feel to it.In contrast, this Lux thermostat's plastic shell and buttons feel cheap;  you have to flip the front open and manipulate sliders and hold various buttons down - 2 seconds in one case, 5 seconds in another - to switch into modes that let you program.  The installation instructions are a bit of a joke - so many steps are omitted and so few are illustrated.  For example, the obvious step of detaching the back plate for installation is not mentioned, and it wasn't completely obvious how to do it without trial and error.  After wiring the back plate, they never tell you to push the thermostat onto it.  Not worth detailing every step that had errors or was omitted, but it wouldn't matter too much for someone who has installed a thermostat before - but for someone for whom this is their first, I just cannot recommend the Lux in comparison with the crystal clear and lavishly illustrated Honeywell installation manual - down to Honeywell's caution to properly dispose of the toxic mercury switch in old thermostats.  The PDF manuals for these and most products are online, so I recommend that buyers review them before purchasing to get a full feel for installation and operation.The display on the screen does not look like the photo with this product listing, so they must have changed the software.  The room temperature number is smaller, and there is a permanent battery level display to the right of it in the shape of a battery with a %-sign next to it.  Because my batteries are new (not included), it looks almost like a large black ""1"" to the right of the room temperature.  Ugly, confusing and unnecessary.Granted, this Lux TX9100Uc is half the price of the Honeywell - and for that I can excuse the cheap plastic, but not the poor instructions and software (firmware).  If you're in a cool-only and/or heat-only climate and on a tight budget, I'm sure you'll find this fine.  If you're in an area that needs heat in the morning and air conditioning in the afternoon, you'll want to look at the Honeywell or other thermostats that can handle multiple modes automatically per day, as this Lux can only be in heat or cool mode based on a a slider switch behind the hinged front panel.UPDATE 11/2/14:  This TX9100Uc is not ""daylight savings time"" aware.  My old Honeywells, mentioned above, automatically set themselves back an hour last night, but not this Lux.  I see now that it isn't mentioned as a product feature, although another Lux product has it.  Another reason for me to not particularly recommend this thermostat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3ORDFZNOOU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX2QA3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3ORDFZNOOU7","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bose, Bose, Bose.  Years go by and you guys don't learn...  There are two versions of the QuietComfort 2 - which are only distinguishable by the shape of the socket/plug for the audio cable.The original QuietComfort 2 has a perfectly round black plastic shaft.  The revised version, matching this cable, has a slot in the headphone for a long ridge along the shift.  The perfectly round cable will fit any model.  This version with the ridge only fits the newer version unless you use a tool of some kind (I'll try a Dremmel) to file off the ridge.My cable broke a few years ago, and I had to phone Bose to get them to re-ship the correct cable.  My wife's cable just started disintegrating last month (multiple plastic breaks all along the length, exposing the wires) - so I ordered this, hoping that Bose had their act together by now.  Apparently not.If you are not comfortable cutting/filing down the plastic ridge and your old QC 2 was one, like mine, that did NOT have the ridge, you would be better off phoning Bose directly to make sure that they send the correct cable.

"I've used NiMH rechargeables since they first appeared in AA and AAA sizes. My previous chargers were dumb ""light goes green when done"" chargers. This BC-2000 charger is pretty amazing in comparison, offering choices for charge current, progress indicators showing storage capacity and voltage, special discharge and reconditioning modes, and a test mode that works even with alkaline batteries. (Be sure NOT to insert alkaline batteries in any other cycle!)Compared to having to separately use a multimeter to check the status of my batteries - without as much information as provided here - the Ambient Weather charger is a breeze. Love it so far after charging 3 batches of NiMH batteries.Also, my other chargers require insertion of batteries in pairs, and this charger treats each battery bay as a separate charger. You can insert and remove any number as needed.Only slightly strange thing is that the user manual - including the PDF online - says that the device will default to charging at 200 mA, but the default is 400 mA. No biggie, just weird that the online PDF isn't updated. I'm guessing this is something to do with the update to the device, as the box has a big round sticker saying ""with 2nd generation firmware and hardware design"".The User Manual, like the device, is something only a nerd/geek will read and understand. The average consumer - which includes pretty much every family member I can think of - would not understand half of the manual, nor figure out how to operate the options on the charger. A simple, graphical 'how to' for each task would make using this charger a piece of cake for even a member of Congress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCJBPDLG9WVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUZHL4C#wasThisHelpful","R1HCJBPDLG9WVX","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Mead scissors are sharp with a tight fit between blades that cuts paper and thin fabric well, although if the intention is for sewing, I'd recommend a high quality fabric shears instead.The shape of the finger holes is such that they work left or right handed.

"I cannot believe how bad this ""Motorola"" streaming camera and the associated Hubble cloud service are.  I've rarely reviewed anything so horrifically badly implemented, and advise all readers to avoid this device even if, as me, it is provided at no cost to you.  Look instead to something like the Dropcam Pro Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera.  Yes, the up front cost will be more, but that will diminish over time if you subscribe to cloud storage - but also, you'll get a true clear, smooth, high-definition video stream instead of the fuzzy, jerky video transmitted by this FOCUS66.This was so bad, that I had to verify that indeed, Motorola does not exist as an engineering firm any longer (we old timers would associate Motorola with quality based on name recognition).  Instead, it is a patent portfolio and the name and logo are licensed for marketing purposes in this case to a company called Binatone Electronics which created this device and the Hubble video cloud service available at http://hubbleconnected.comSetup is a convoluted process using the Hubble app for IOS and Android to connect to the camera as if it were a WiFi hotspot.  My first sign of trouble was touching the link to read the full terms and conditions... as there was no exit or back button to get me back to where I had already entered my desired user name and password.  I got multiple ""Unable to join the network"" messages on my iPad Air as I followed the instructions to set up the camera even though it was in pairing mode.  After multiple attempts, I finally connected and got it set up ... and then no live streaming would appear.  I connected, and quit the iPad app multiple times and could never get a live stream.  Installed on my iPhone and again no live stream...  and eventually, only on my iPhone, I got a message that the camera firmware needed an update.  After that, live streaming worked.  (As another reviewer has noted - it is not at all clear if a live stream on a local network only uses the local network, as the manual states, or does in fact go through the Hubble cloud servers.)My internet connection is fast.  VDSL with 40 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up.  So, my observations of this camera's quality have nothing to do with my connection...The live stream is jerky (low frames per second), has a very small viewing cone, and is fuzzy.  If I was trying to recognize a burglar, determine if a baby spit up saliva or food, etc. ... it would be impossible.  If this indeed produces 720p video ... the quality of those pixels is so low, that it is irrelevant.  The images are simply horrible.  Yes, I removed all packing plastic and cleaned the lens.Contrast this jerky live stream to the incredibly detailed, smooth, true high-def image that I get from a relative's Dropcam Pro stream.  Night and day - and the Dropcam has a wider viewing angle to capture more of a room or other scene, among other superior features.Motion alerts.  How could they be as bad as they are?  The default is that the camera can send alerts for motion or sound.  You can tune the sensitivity and even turn either off.  Other cameras have an internal buffer so that when motion is detected, the video clip saved begins slightly before the motion.  With the FOCUS66, the video clip starts considerably after the motion (my cats are my test subjects) ... and then continues for a long time with no motion whatsoever.  For example, a typical cat capture with the camera aimed at the door for them wanting in has a couple of seconds of cat, followed by about 25 seconds of the door. Worthless for home security, babies, or whatever you want the streaming cam to capture.  This, too, is something that Dropcam does right.To watch the alert video on your IOS device or for Mac users in the Safari web browser... what looks like a video player comes up ... with a round 'thumb' for the time position within the video as it plays.  But, the IOS app or Mac browser (don't have Android or Windows to test there) will not let you ""scrub"" the video ... to drag the thumb dot backwards or forwards to a critical frame and then pause.  You must instead close the viewer and then watch again from the beginning.You can log onto the Hubble site on a desktop computer and download these alert videos.  Strangely, you can only download from a desktop - which does not have the ability to control certain other settings that only the IOS or Android app can do (e.g., set the temperature format to F or C).  BUT... is it mp4?  No!  The fuzzy, jagged, jerky downloaded video is in FLV/Flash format.  Who are they kidding.  Have you tried to edit an FLV video?Temperature.  It is kind of cool that the FOCUS66 has a temperature sensor and can even send temperature alerts (you set a low and high temp).  But, Fahrenheit vs Celsius:  you can only choose the scale on the IOS or Android app ... but if I select Fahrenheit there - then I see Celsius in Safari on my Mac.  Have to wonder if these people tested anything at all before going to manufacturing.Even though I got a pre-release version of this FOCUS66 for free, I have absolutely no idea what I might use it for since the picture is of such low quality and the motion capture clips are unreliable and grab the wrong content.UPDATE: Yesterday, the Hubble server would not let me view the motion alerts for at least an hour (I was then without a signal for a while).  If the alert is important:  e.g., baby or intruder, any kind of server issue makes the alert almost worthless.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNIC17277ONNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K81OTP8#wasThisHelpful","RNIC17277ONNP","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the same stainless steel fingertip strawberry huller for about 40 years, one very similar to Norpro 5127 Strawberry Huller with Finger Grip.  It works well with any size berry, as long as it is soft (ripe), particularly with local or wild berries.  The finger grip lets the huller stay on your hand while you have both hands available to work with the berries and waste.  (I slip it on my middle finger; others with smaller hands use their thumb.)  Equally nice is that the edges of mine are blunt, making the finger huller safe for children to use.The OXO Twist & Pop huller here at first seems massive for such a simple job and the teeth are quite keep-out-of-reach-of-children sharp.  Yet, for strawberries on the firm side of ripe and of medium to large size - it works remarkably well!  The teeth go right through the leaves, which is part of what makes this OXO huller so fast.. just plunge, twist and pull.  (In contrast, the finger huller mentioned above cannot press through leaves - making the process a little slower as you brush the leaves to the side or pull them off in an extra step.)  The size is actually comfortable in the hand... and I suspect that the large size would make it comfortable for someone suffering from arthritis, too.The OXO is an epic fail for smaller or very ripe berries.  It'll just mash them into mush.The hole left by the OXO huller looks large when the OXO is pressed halfway in before twisting... but when I look at the removed leaves and hull - there really isn't much waste there at all.  Just an illusion based on the shape of the removed bit, I think.... at least on larger berries.  If pushed fully in, the hole is ridiculously large with a lot of wast.  Even on the largest berries, the OXO teeth did not fully close over the hull when twisted, so I never had a case where I needed to push the button to release the hull.In sum:  not safe for children in my opinion, this huller is efficient for medium to large strawberries that are slightly on the firm side.  For riper or smaller berries, and for children, I would look at other methods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NMBBNN0SHWOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3W2RJO#wasThisHelpful","R2NMBBNN0SHWOS","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Bissell 1305 has enough design features that I really like (""Wow, it fits THERE!"") to make up for the ones that have me scratching my head (""What WERE they thinking?!"").First off, I have to pick on the ambiguity of the product name.  This is NOT a ""pet vacuum"" - which would be used, presumably, to vacuum your pets, similar to the Electro Groom which we have to vacuum our horse.  (Really... you do vacuum the horse's coat... and would not believe how great this is until you've done it.)  Rather, this is a vacuum that owners of pets that shed hair inside their home will appreciate.  But, pretty much, it is just a vacuum that anyone can use, pets or not.We have a Dyson (mixed feelings - more negative than positive) and a Kenmore HEPA Intelliclean upright (which is great, even on bare floors, but not along edges).With cats and dogs, the (expensive) bag on our Kenmore fills up with animal hair and stray kitty litter long before it has filled with dust and dirt.  A bagless vacuum such as this Bissell is a great choice when lots of pet hair is involved.  A real plus of the Bissell over our other vacuums is its size and edge-to-edge suction.  The vacuum head is not very tall - and easily fits under the toe-kick of our kitchen cabinets - something our other vacuums cannot do.  Stairs!  The width of this Bissell head is only one foot - PERFECT for being able to vacuum the treads of stairs side to side, something none of our other vacuums could ever do.  And, less effort is required for vacuuming stairs due to the swiveling head and the ability to hold/lift the unit by the handle above the dirt tank.  Super long cord lets you get the stairs done without having to move to another outlet at the other end.Do a quick-release on the tank, and place the end in a trash bag and push the bottom/trap-door release button to dump everything you picked up.Attachments?  Very limited.  This comes with a crevice tool and a suction-activated upholstery brush.  No extension arms, dust brush, etc.  And nowhere to store anything other than the crevice tool (inside the extension hose).PowerGlide?  It works well ... and is pretty much the action of the spinning floor brush pulling the vacuum forward while you work, requiring less muscle.There are aspects of the machine design that are very similar to the Dyson (which is of course much more expensive).  Unlike our Dyson (an original model), the vacuum head has rollers in the front to prevent scratching of hardwood floors.  The cyclone suction dirt container feels like a copy of a Dyson.  But, the hose engineering is really lame in comparison.  The Dyson has a single super-long hose that the handle/wand is inserted into - and when you use the hose with tools, it exits the machine in an upwards direction so as not to kink.  In contrast, this Bissell has an extremely short hose connecting to the floor head.  If you remove the hose to use a tool, it is so short that you would have to be on your hands and knees as seen in the manufacturer's photo on this product page.  To get a longer hose, you attach the extension hose, and can now stand... but the hose is kinked:  it exits the vacuum pointed downwards, and you're now pulling the hose upwards to reach things.  Just doesn't make sense and I have to wonder how many years will pass before the hose will tear at that connection.As others have mentioned, the User Guide's assembly instructions leave a lot to be desired.  The detail images for putting the pieces together are about 1"" tall, and the part of any image that you need to see is only 1/4"" tall.  They should just provide a web link to a web page with large, color images if they cannot justify a better printed manual.Why 5 stars then instead of 4?  Because I view this as a secondary, not primary vacuum (based on the included tools)... and for getting the hairy areas of the house, the stairs, under counters, and the spilled kitty litter, this lightweight, bag-free Bissell seems a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGRPY3QE4VNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR5UJJU#wasThisHelpful","R2OGRPY3QE4VNV","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very pleased with the value and performance of this SanDisk Extreme PRO 480 GB SSD.I was a SSD early adopter and only felt that I could afford a 120 GB drive when I originally converted my Early 2008 Mac Pro some years ago when prices were much higher.  While that smaller SSD reduced boot time and application launch time, it was too small to fit my user account onto it.  I cloned that drive onto this SanDisk 480GB unit via an external dock, and replaced the smaller SSD with the SanDisk in the Icy Dock EZConvert 2.5-Inch to 3.5-Inch SATA SSD / Hard Drive Converter which fits the pre-2013 Mac Pro drive bays perfectly.  Finally, I migrated my User folders to the SanDisk SSD boot volume from one of the other internal hard disks.Performance is excellent and significantly better than when I only had the operating system on an SSD.  The SATA controllers on my 2008 Mac Pro are only capable of 3 GB/s so I cannot obtain the advertised peak data transfer rates.

"This Logitech Big Bang case provides great protection from abuse via a thick rubberize surround.  If you'll be using your iPad Air in an environment where it is likely to be abused - for example at a trade show with concrete floor - I would definitely consider this.  I don't like it at all for every day use, though, because of its weight and bulk.It's easy to slip the iPad Air into the case, but the cover is a little squirrelly - does not always shut perfectly like an Apple Smart Cover... and so the magnet to put the iPad to sleep or wake it up doesn't always do its thing.  The Logitech description says that the cover safeguards from accidental spills ... but it doesn't cover any of the ports - only the lock and volume buttons - so liquid spilled on the iPad can still enter the headphone jack, lightening charge port, speakers, etc.  The case is so thick, that it is impossible to plug a credit card reader into the headphone jack without buying a special extension cable.I would argue with the product description as ""ultra-slim, feather-light"".  Who are they kidding?  The case weights almost as much as the iPad Air itself!  My Air (cellular model) is 1.06 pounds and the case is .92 pounds.  Total is about 2 pounds.  The extra weight and bulk make my Air feel like the iPad 1.All of these factors make me drop a star for this case which is still very suitable for many environments.I'd use this when at a trade show or other harsh environment where the Big Bang protects the air from abuse and its stand offers multiple angles securely, unlike the unstable vertical position with an Apple Smart Cover.  But on a day to day basis, try as I did, I just hated the weight,  bulk and tactile feel of the Big Bang and prefer my Belkin Shield Sheer Matte Case / Cover for iPad Air (iPad 5) (Smoke) which only weights 2.5 ounces and my Apple  iPad Air Smart Cover - Black which weights less than 4 ounces.  Total is more than 8 ounces lighter than the Big Bang and feels great in my hand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WG72W0KA515/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZM7TKI#wasThisHelpful","R5WG72W0KA515","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a very long-time user of Norton / Symantec products and highly recommend Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014 - 1 User / 5 Devices [Download] and various other combinations of multi-license packs of Norton 360.As I write this, the Norton web site does not provide ANY information whatsoever about what software products will be installed on Windows, Mac, Android or IOS devices as part of this ""Small Business"" package.  That's just unacceptable.  Because it is a business product... I expected top-of-the-line Norton products, namely Norton 360 and Norton Hotspot Privacy for mobile devices.  But that is not the case.I was extremely disappointed that this 10 device ""Small Business"" pack - which costs more per device than the 360 Multi-Device - installs only Norton Internet Security under Windows, rather than their complete 360 product.  Why pay more to get less?The main features of 360 that I miss in plain Internet Security are the file and registry clean-up utilities.Symantec does not offer multiple options for Macs, IOS or Android devices... so there was no need to evaluate installation on those platforms.  (In general, you can read that people advice NOT installing the product on Macs... and IOS devices already have the features that Norton provides.)The only positive thing I can say for this ambiguously-marketed product is that it allows the distribution of its overpriced licenses to other individuals (presumably in your small business) by registering their email address...so that the recipients do not need access to your confidential Norton ID login credentials.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346UY7KWKC8ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZNHU88#wasThisHelpful","R346UY7KWKC8ZA","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've brewed teas from Traditional Medicinals and several other organic producers for many years, but had not tried this Green Tea / Peppermint combination before.Delicious and smooth, it should really be called ""Peppermint Green Tea"", as there is twice as much peppermint leaf by mass and the mint is the only noticeable flavor.  In one test brewing, I brewed a cup of this tea, a cup of peppermint only, and a large cup with peppermint as well as green tea bags.  I used the Traditional Medicinals long brewing method of 10 to 15 minutes (advised for pretty much all of their products)- which goes against typical advice for brewing green tea (shorter time and lower temperature to avoid bitterness).I could detect no green tea flavor at all in this tea when compared to pure peppermint tea, nor could I detect any bitterness - which was quite evident in my other test cup which brewed organic green tea and peppermint together for the same duration.The box claims about 12 mg caffeine per bag, which is about half that of green tea brewed alone - and is as much as the maximum Mayo Clinic measured for certain decaffeinated black teas and coffees.We choose Traditional Medicinals teas for the health benefits of certain of their blends along with being certified organic, Fair Trade and non-GMO.  This is a very pleasant minty tea at a remarkably good price via Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341559WLYOI0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSYVFQY#wasThisHelpful","R341559WLYOI0P","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very pleased with this Linksys WRT1900AC router so far.  It's replacing a Netgear WNDR3800 N600 Premium Edition Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Router to provide AC service as well as extended wifi range.Setup was painless.  The wizard could be accessed either via Wifi (I used my iPad), or via cable and connection to 192.168.1.1.  The instruction booklet contained the default SSID and password, so that if configuring via Wifi, there was no need to look at the small print on the sticker on the device, as is often the case.  We have a variety of Macs, iPads, iPhones, AppleTV, Nest Thermostat, printers and scanners on our network.  All negotiate their connection to the WRT1900AC faster than to the Netgear, perhaps due to the dual processor managing the Linksys.  I reserved certain network addresses for certain devices as required by our workflow. Set up up our guest network with a different SSID, renamed devices in the network map.  All easy.Range.  We have full bars now in a bedroom that previously required a range extender, and speedtest shows full internet speed at that location.  While some have commented on the potential additional power requirements of this router, in our case, eliminating the power used by a range extender probably makes that a wash.Speed.  I tested transferring a 1.34GB video file from my gigabit-wired Mac Pro to a recent iMac.  With a Wifi AC connection on the WRT1900AC, the transfer was about 24.8 MB/s (megabyte, not bit) and with a wired gigabit connection it was 95.7 MB/s, or less than 4 times faster.  In contrast, the best the Netgear could do at N speeds was 3.7 MB/s.  Getting a factor of 6.6 increase in wifi speed to the iMac via AC is tremendous.The USB port painlessly shared a thumb drive with the connected computers.  I haven't tried the eSATA port yet, which is an interesting addition, as it could potentially give NAS-like speed for the attached device.Range, fast device connection speed, fast data transfer, and easy setup make this an easy router to recommend.  The web interface takes some getting used to compared with others that I've used... for example, finding where port forwarding is buried. But, that's my only quibble at this point.UPDATE:  Even happier now that it is clear that the WRT1900AC resolved various device drops that happened with my prior Netgear WNDR3800.  A Wifi laser printer stays available continuously now, where it had to be restarted daily before.  Apple file sharing between our Macs works 100% of the time now - while with the Netgear, connection by name from Finder was not possible, only by IP address... and even that sometimes didn't work and required reconnecting each machine even though they they were otherwise successfully connected to that router and had internet service.  I suffered through it thinking it was an issue with an OS X update; now I know it was the router.  Great to have fast, reliable connections with the Linksys WRT1900AC.UPDATE 2:  The Linksys USB 3 port and gigabit ethernet give better performance for a USB 3 drive than a direct USB 2 connection in my 6 year old Mac Pro.  About 3x faster copying a video file to a USB 3 drive connected to the Linksys WRT1900AC than the same drive connected to a USB 2 port on the Mac Pro.  Also, almost 2 months after my review... our network is still running smoothly and I have not had to power cycle the Linksys router even once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVYPD5NIT3ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KEK4Q5Q#wasThisHelpful","RCVYPD5NIT3ER","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 8/3/2015: I've dropped another star because after 18 months of pretty light usage (about 100 pages per month), the feed mechanism no longer works.  Worked fine one day.  The next time I turned it on, the feed mechanism is making a nasty clicking noise and cannot separate the pages of a multiple page document.  Only a single page can be fed at a time with a click-click-click sound in the process.  I followed the troubleshooting directions and found nothing visibly wrong with the rollers - which I'd not examined before to observe how cheap they are.  Baffled that just out of the blue it stopped working and 6 months out of warranty.  I've become dependent on this fast scanner, but will look to another manufacturer for a replacement. [Other reviewers are reporting this issue as well.]Original Review: Just awful software and documentation, particularly related to the wireless setup.  You cannot simply switch from USB to Wifi and back again, but must re-install the scanner driver and select the interface.  For Wifi, the Access Point method failed for me - the unit never broadcast its SSID for me to connect to it for configuration.  Instead, I had to use WPS setup, which was an option on my router, fortunately.  You can read some other reviews of issues when your router does not have a WPS setup mode.In the box was a big ""Notice"" sheet saying that the latest firmware had to be installed for the network interface panel before scanning.  Gave a generic Epson web address and said to download the Epson Firmware Updater... but there was no such thing anywhere on the Epson site.  Googling, I found it redirected me to the standard Epson software updater... which did not provide any firmware update, nor even provide any feedback on the firmware.  Epic fail.This DS-560 scanner is the sibling of the DS-510 scanner that I reviewed in January.  The only difference is the addition of the B/G/N wireless interface.  Both can operate via USB 2.  I'm merging some of my comments from that earlier review with ones specific to the DS-560 here:The speed and quietness of this DS-560 scanner is remarkable.  I tested with both large documents and stacks of thin thermal receipts. I easily got the rated 26 pages per minute on the 190 page report that I scanned. The pages were punched for a comb binding (19 rectangular holes in the side) and the corners were dog-eared. After setting up a new job-type that masked the left one half inch to eliminate the binding holes, the scanned document was like new - no dog ears or holes - a perfect scan, incredibly fast. Even with all of the holes and bends, there were no jams.The 26 pages per minute speed is the speed of the paper getting through the machine. There is an additional delay afterwards as the data is transferred to the computer via USB 2 and the software processes the images.For thermal receipts from stores, I changed the paper setting to 'thin' and got excellent results with text enhancement enabled. I set that job to create a fresh PDF for every page (receipt) - vs my job for the large report that kept asking for more pages until the scan for the single PDF was complete.I tested the color drop-out feature which worked very well. Setting a scan to grayscale, I selected blue as the dropout color and scanned a Costco receipt that had a blue highlighter drawn down it. Color gone, image looked like it had never been marked up. A text that has been highlighted with yellow highlighter will scan as if never highlighted. Nice built-in feature.I'm on a Mac...The hardware scan button can be programmed on a Mac, but it only works when connected via USB, not Wifi.  Launch Document Capture, click the Scan > Manage Job menu or the gear icon in the toolbar. Select or create a job. With any job selected, click the gear icon in the Job List > Event Settings ... and pick the job that should be run when the scan button is pressed. Close Document Capture.The software functionality is typical Epson, with options squirreled away in several different tabs and buttons, and not all options available in all places (e.g., Epson Scan vs Document Capture job setup).Note: If you're a Mac user, there is no software included to create searchable PDF's, one of the top features listed for the scanner.  You'll need your own copy of Adobe Acrobat Pro (or something similar) to do that at extra cost. Windows users, however, can scan to searchable (text-recognized) PDF.The Epson driver, when connected via Wifi, does not work with Acrobat Pro in my experience.  It is not a standard Twain driver and communicates partway, then locks up.  When used via Wifi, the scanner is not listed as an available scanner by the OS X Image Capture app, or the system preferences. This is a really serious issue for Mac users and takes a star off my review.  Since you need to use USB for reliable scanning on OS X from apps other than Epson Scan, just buy the cheaper USB-only  Epson DS-510 WorkForce Document Scanner (B11B209201) which I give 5 stars to.Both Windows and Mac platforms have ABBY FineReader to convert scans to editable word processing or spreadsheet documents.  I've found that ABBY does a better job of text recognition for later editing in Word than doing the text recognition in Adobe Acrobat Pro and exporting as a Word document.The Epson software does not come with an Uninstall utility for Mac. The online Help manual directs you to their web site where you can download an uninstaller. Running it, though, only offers the ability to uninstall each Epson app... it does not offer the ability to uninstall any particular Epson scanner. In my case, I have the driver for an old Epson scanner on my machine... and so that scanner and this new DS-560 both show up every time I want to scan with the Epson software, and I have to choose which one to use. Epson provides no way to remove the unused, old driver (much less this new DS-560 driver).IOS app...I installed the Epson Documentscan app on my iPad and it found the scanner and provided a basic set of settings for the scan, although there was no control at all for compression level.  Scanning a two-sided document created a huge PDF.  Once saved in the app, you can send it to an email, Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Kindle, etc.But, if someone wants to go paperless and only has a tablet, the app just isn't adequate.  Suppose you have a stack of receipts that you want in your Dropbox as individual, named documents for taxes.  You have to initiate a separate scan for every receipt.  From the desktop app, you can specify that each page will be a separate document, load 50 receipts, and you're done (other than renaming the files perhaps).Scanning BOTH sides of a two-sided document so quickly and with so little noise is almost magical. The software issues, difficulty in setting up a Wifi connection other than via WPS, inability to switch between Wifi and USB modes, and the lack of an included carrier sheet drops one star for me.  If I were to give an overall ""normal"" consumer rating, thinking of non-IT people I know who would find the instructions, software and setup challenging ... or thinking of someone who only wanted this for wireless access from their mobil device...I would give it 3 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0VEQAYBMJCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHCJY5A#wasThisHelpful","R2A0VEQAYBMJCQ","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Francois et Mimi (made in China, as are most stainless steel items these days) 50 ounce french press is an excellent value and makes great coffee if you fill the pot near to its capacity.  The actual capacity is approximately 42 ounces - not counting the volume lost to the grounds.... so about three 12 ounce mugs in reality.The reason for my caveat about making a full pot is that, unlike the other dozen or so french presses that I've had or still have, the stem on the press mechanism here is too short - and when pressed fully down, the screen is about 2.25 inches above the bottom of the carafe.  If you make less than a full pot, this means that you'll have grounds and water sloshing around below the screen continuing to extract the bitter remnants of the grounds, agitating the sediment and not letting the other grounds help filter out the finest particles when you pour.With a full or nearly full pot (I added 9 scoops of grounds and water to within an inch of the spout), this screen position isn't an issue and the resulting coffee was super.Assuming that the other presses by Francois et Mimi have the same short press stem, I'd advise choosing a model that is closer to what you would normally brew.I have a variety of smaller (32 ounce and below) presses, so this press is a welcome addition for when we have company or I feel a need to get really wired.  The double-walled carafe keeps the bottom from getting warm - leaving it safe to place on any surface.  It also keeps the coffee hot for quite a while - 20 minutes after pouring my first mug, the coffee was still as hot as I would want it and had not turned bitter yet.My only quibble beyond the short press stem is that when you disassemble the screens (simply unscrew like all presses) - the thin mesh screen just has a hole cut in the center.  I'm not sure how many years this will last ... my other presses, 3 different brands, all have a stainless steel washer welded or crimped to this center hole for reinforcement.  Dishwasher-safe, yet you do need to disassemble the screens to clean thoroughly, unlike Frieling's which are shaped in a way that can often (not always!) clean the screens in a dishwasher without disassembly.This somewhat retro / 60's-looking 50 ounce Francois et Mimi press does not have the heft or the modern design of a Frieling Polished Stainless French Press, 23-Ounce (44-Ounce), but at a fraction of the cost it is an excellent value and highly recommended.-----------Proportions used for testing:I dialed my Breville BCG800XL Smart Grinder down to the French Press position, and selected 8 cups.  This produced 9 scoops of coarsely ground coffee which went into the pre-warmed press.  Water boils at my high altitude at 202 degrees, which is just right for press coffee, so I filled the press halfway with boiling water and covered (plunger up), letting it sit for about a minute.  Removed the cover, stirred the floating grounds gently with a wooden spoon a few times - causing them to sink and the crema to develop.  Added enough more water to reach about an inch below the spout.  Covered again and let sit for another 4 minutes before pressing the plunger.  Perfect cup, smooth and rich.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYTE6TFQXE1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSRQN0Q#wasThisHelpful","R1VYTE6TFQXE1U","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hard to beat the price for this Samsung Class 6 32 GB SDHC card.  If you have devices that cannot take cards faster than Class 6 (such as my Canon HD video camera), then this card is the best value out there at the moment.Works perfectly in two Canon cameras that I have.  Tested the speed of a full initialization (format) as well as copying files on my Mac... and while the Lexar Multi-Use 32GB SDHC Flash Memory Card (LSD32GASBNACL6) was a bit more than 10% faster, I don't believe that this would affect normal camera operations.  That Lexar card, at this writing, costs 32% more than this Samsung.My only quibble is that the card does not come with a case.  I have lots of memory cards that I take on video shoots and most came with SD-sized plastic cases to keep the contacts clean when not in the camera and to help organize the cards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4I4HZ8MTT0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVPU5HY#wasThisHelpful","R2O4I4HZ8MTT0C","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You can tell when a set of authors have not been through the fire of teaching a group of people something in person, but are doing their best to write up their own, expert experience.  Things get explained out of order or incoherently without the experience of interacting with people as they learn, discovering what they needed to know that you forgot to tell them, or watching their faces screw up in confusion and call you on a recursive explanation that actually says nothing.This is such a book, in my opinion.  It has some valuable information because of the depth of coding experience of the authors - but even for an experienced programmer who might already know some Objective-C and Cocoa, I find the presentation tangled.  For example, the audience is defined as ""a reasonably capable programmer"", and yet the chapter introducing Objective-C alleges to introduce what it means to be an object-oriented language (something a capable programmer in 2014 should be aware of anyway) ... and then manages to not provide a meaningful overview of what it means to be object-oriented...or to introduce Objective-C for that matter.  The Cocoa frameworks are not so much introduced with their purpose and overview and master hierarchy as much as bits and pieces are simply used here and there.  There is no big picture.The publisher, O'Reilly, should be ashamed of the quality of the printing for the screenshots which are pretty much unreadable and muddy. My 'favorite' is Figure 7-13  which is pretty much a solid gray screen which was supposed to represent a blue gradient fill.  In general, the screenshots are not that necessary for following the content so not a deal breaker.In contrast to this book, the books associated with ""The Big Nerd Ranch"" and author Aaron Hillegass are clean and clear as one reads and learns and I recommend them instead for those looking for a sequential learning resource.Slight tangent:  Even with the new Swift language from Apple (June 2014 / XCode 6 Beta) replacing Objective-C as the recommended language for new code (or at least new coders), anyone working on the OS X or IOS platforms needs at least a reading, if not working, knowledge of Object-C because of the vast amount of existing code and resources in Objective-C.  So, don't think that Swift eliminates the usefulness of books such as this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVQ4CG8M96CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149190139X#wasThisHelpful","ROVQ4CG8M96CX","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ready to just plug into a Mac and use, this high capacity and USB 3 fast Seagate 4 TB drive is an excellent value.  But, the noise it makes is really annoying.  Really annoying.  It varies from a constant grinding whir to a buzzing, most of which seems related to the plastic shell which is a little loose and clearly has no sound-dampening pads attached to the inside.  If your Mac has a fan, you probably won't notice this.  For new iMacs which are almost silent, as well as Macbook Airs which are silent, this could be a factor for you.  Of course, if you have forced air ventilation where you use this, you'll never notice.The plastic shell is attractive and has small rubber feet for placing the drive horizontally on a work surface.  The corners are dangerously sharp.  I'm not really sure why the photos show the drive placed vertically like the previous generation of Seagate drives... because this drive is not designed for vertical orientation.

"I'm reasonably happy with this D-Link DAP-1520 Wifi range extender...when it works.  (Note that Amazon has aggregated all kinds of D-Link device reviews together here... be sure you look for reviews that actually cover the device you're considering.  No idea why Amazon does this!)Setup was easy using the WPS buttons on both the unit and my Netgear WNDR3800 N600 Premium Edition Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Router.  You can also perform the setup through a web browser interface to the device.  Be sure, regardless of how you perform the setup, to go to the web interface and update the firmware.  My DAP-1520 came with firmware version 1.00 and the update at this writing was to version 1.02 which was dated 3/24/14.My router is on one floor, and I plugged this DAP-1520 in a central location on the next floor where the signal to the router was strong.  The result is a strong signal everywhere on the second floor for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz transmitters.  I find that I get slightly better speed test results with the 5G frequency, with a big BUT:  the range for 5G is very limited.  If I go out in the yard, I lose 5G pretty quickly, but the 2.4G range is over 50 feet.As with all Wifi, the distance from the transmitter reduces the data rate.  You may see full bars, 2 bars, etc... but those discrete 'levels' do not reflect the continuous small loss of signal as distances increase.  I saw nothing about this DAP-1520 that was out of the ordinary for Wifi performance, except that I believe that the internal antennae are not adequate for both frequencies.  Close to the device, I get slightly higher speeds over 5GHz... at about 30 feet, I get half the speed at 5GHz, but only slightly less performance over 2.4GHz.My house is vertically arranged, so for practical purposes, this device fills my low signal spots and is perfect.  For a sprawling house, you might need several extenders (although you should then centrally locate your router so that you're not extending the extenders and losing performance that way).Neither my router, not any of my devices can handle the newer AC protocol, so I cannot evaluate the DAP-1520 on its acceptable implementation and relay of that.I dropped to 2 stars stars because the DAP-1520 has become 'wedged' daily, offering only about 300kbps downloads on either channel.  After unplugging it and plugging it back in, speeds returned to normal.  Not worth dropping another star is the peculiar continuous handshaking and waste of bandwidth that the DAP-1520 does with my router... transferring about 1k of information every second when no devices are connected.If D-Link comes out with another firmware update to keep the device running at full speed without daily reboots, then I'd be happy considering how effective this is in my house, how easy this is to set up, and how compact and inconspicuous the device is.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OH0DLSPKBKGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I48MK9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1OH0DLSPKBKGW","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FileMaker - A Mixed BagFileMaker Pro 13 (FMP13) continues FileMaker's excruciatingly slow evolution.  Instead of the tag line ""An Apple Subsidiary"", the FileMaker Inc tagline should be  ""Owned by Apple, but apparently with no Apple Product Management Oversight"" lest buyers anticipate an Apple-like experience.This should be a great product, but I rate it as just 3-stars, which is ""It's OK"" in Amazon's rating scale.  I've taken a few weeks to evaluate version 13.0v3, test new databases, and convert parts of an existing database.Bottom line at the top (for those who don't want to read my long ramble):  If you expect that your database needs are and will remain limited to ONLY Windows desktops, then in my opinion, Microsoft Access is your strongest choice.  (Even Access 2002, which I am still using, is more powerful on the Windows platform than FMP13.)  In all other configurations - requiring Mac, Windows and Mac, desktop and mobile, desktop and web, etc - FMP13 is really the only game in town.  Give the 30-day trial a whirl to see if it satisfies your needs.The good:One of the best things about FileMaker is that it is cross-platform (Windows and Mac - unlike Microsoft Access), and is multi-user, including mobile devices with the free FileMaker Go app for IOS.  This functionality is only on your local network (LAN), unless you purchase a subscription to FileMaker Server.  Working with my iPad and desktop at the same time was seamless.With FileMaker Server, you can not only have multiple users on multiple devices anywhere... you can also provide a web interface to your database.  (In FileMaker  Pro 12, you could provide a web-based interface to your database at no extra charge using Instant Web Publishing.  That feature was removed from FMP13.)  FM Server is licensed annually, so it is a continuous cost, and not cheap.  You still need the hardware platform to run Server, but the software fee runs from $348/year for one user to $3,348/year for up to 50 concurrent users.  (Web designers expecting large numbers of visitors would of course look elsewhere to things like MySQL solutions.)Another strength of FileMaker is the attractive presentation of Layouts - which represent on-screen forms as well as reports.  With 13, there is even more flexibility in defining Themes, which allow for easily changing the color scheme, fonts, etc ... and for making groups of Layouts consistent.  (This is not unlike themes in certain design products.  It is not like CSS themes for web sites in that a subsequent theme change does NOT change existing Layouts...only new ones.)The fact that FileMaker can operate on desktops, phones, tablets and web browsers, and has Themes, would lead one to suppose that it might have fluid layouts that automatically conform (per rules) to screen sizes, like modern fluid web site designs.  But, unfortunately, that's not the case.  As the examples included in the product illustrate... you'll most likely want to design separate layouts for each screen type.The not-so-good:Crash example.  FMP13 crashed numerous times while I tried to import a variety of Excel files (.xls).  Opening and re-saving the files in Excel got me past that.Bug example.  Auto-update tables don't refresh the data in linked layouts.  I imported an Excel file with the setting to refresh the contents upon launch and displayed a Layout that showed records that were joined to that table.  I edited the Excel data, quit FMP13 and relaunched... and the Layout looked the same... the linked fields did not change.  Only by switching to the layout for the refreshed table and then going back to the desired layout did I see the effect of the re-import.  Pretty serious as the wrong data is initially seen.  (FMP13 can live-link to other FMP13 databases, which is great, so you can partition your data and share bits of it as needed.  I just wish it could live link to other external files like Microsoft Access always has - allowing live updates as other software exports updated versions of data as CSV or Excel, etc.)Referential integrity is poorly implemented in my opinion.  By default, when you set up a relationship (join) between two tables, there is NO referential integrity enforcement.  So, even if the second table represents data that has no meaning if the parent is deleted... deleting the parent will leave orphaned records.  You must manually edit the relationship to check the box to enforce integrity.  This differs from Microsoft Access which enforces integrity unless you say not to, and which also warns you if records will be orphaned, or if a deletion will result in a cascade of deletions of child records.  I received no warnings from FMP13 during testing.  A typical user database could end up with all kinds of problems, or dead records.  (A professional database implemented in FMP13 would require extra scripting to provide a better user experience.)Data entry.  I like quick entry.  Other database programs let you tab past the last field in the last record to start typing a new record.  FMP13 requires that you click the `new record' button.  (If scripting can change that behavior, it doesn't help the casual user who will not be writing such scripts.)Joins.  Strangely, if you join two tables and there is no matching record, the fields for the missing match are displayed as blank.  I didn't see a simple way to have either (a) records hidden if there is no join, or (b) to not display the fields if they are empty.  These things are easy and standard in MS Access.Queries.  In Microsoft Access, I can create complex and elaborate queries, both visually and in SQL when the query cannot be represented visually.  FMP13 only allows SQL in scripts, and even then, the SQL can only retrieve data - not perform schema updates or deletions.  FMP13 limits me to the relationships I can draw in the relationship graph.  This is plenty for simple databases.  It is extremely limiting for sophisticated use.Computations.  A big difference between Microsoft Access and FMP13 is the handling of computed fields.  In Access, you compute either inside your query or on your form or report.  In FMP13, you add additional `calculated' fields to your table and reference these fields in your Layouts.  This latter approach clutters up your table's field list ...but on the plus side, it also means that you don't have to repeat (and maintain) the same formula in multiple layouts as is the case with Access (unless the calculation is inside a common query).  What I don't like about the FMP13 approach is that if I have a dozen reports that each has several calculations... I'll then have several dozen additional calculated fields in my FMP13 table, not organized in any meaningful way to tell me which Layouts (reports) they are used in.  I won't know if I need them, when I can delete them, etc.... so the list of fields will probably just grow longer and more confusing over time from concern about deleting something that might be in use somewhere.Missing basic features.  It is quite common to have Boolean (yes/no, true/false, active/inactive) values in a database.  It is extremely common in normal application software and web pages to have a checkbox that corresponds to the state of a Boolean - checked is `on', unchecked is `off'.  But, here we are in 2014 and FileMaker does not have a Boolean or Yes/No field data type at all... much less a checkbox object that can be assigned to such a type.  The closest you can come is a radio button set with two buttons, one for yes, one for no.  Do a web search for `checkbox filemaker' and read through the proposed solutions.  Apple should be so embarrassed.Scripting in FMP13 is more limited than in Microsoft Access, where Visual Basic for Applications can do pretty much anything and interact with other applications as well.  Reformatting individual records in a table view based on the content of one or more fields of that record is much more complicated than with VBA, for example.  While VBA can control all other Microsoft Office apps, FMP13 itself, and its script language, are seemingly unaware of OS X and the standard Apple apps and data such as Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, etc.  Reformatting a single field is super easy in FMP13, though, although the formula builder does not guide the user properly through the steps of performing a full or partial text match.Bento, which FileMaker Inc dropped as a product, could link-in standard Apple data such as Contacts.  It is inconceivable that they did not add this feature into FileMaker for the Mac platform when they canceled Bento...with similar access to Outlook contacts on Windows.  Etc.When you add new fields to a table, and specify a validation that requires a value... that value is not auto-populated into existing records as it is with Access.FMP13 pricing is peculiar and has a disincentive to upgrade.  FMP13 Advanced includes additional tools for development and customization (most of which, by the way, are included in the standard edition of Microsoft Access as far back as 2000).  The retail price of FMP13 is $329 and the retail price of FMP13 Advanced is $549.  For a user who has purchase FMP13 and decides that they would like the debugger and additional features of Advanced, you would think that the upgrade price would be the price difference (or less) - $220.  But no.  It is $299 - and it is the same price even for users for FileMaker Pro back to version 10.  (Similarly, upgrading to FMP13 costs the same for someone who purchased FMP12 last year... as someone who has version 10 from several years ago. )FileMaker Go is a full featured, stable platform from the tests I've run.  Yet, it is frustrating if you do not subscribe to FileMaker Server (and perhaps that is the intention).  You can leave FMP13 running on your desktop, and access the open databases on your iPad or iPhone while on your LAN.  But, to access them off-site requires extra steps.  You cannot, for example, store a copy of the open database on your IOS device over the LAN (except via iTunes copy).  Instead, you can copy the database into your Dropbox or OneDrive space (or email a copy to yourself) and then download and open it on your IOS device...launching FM Go.  When finished modifying the database remotely, you go through multiple steps to save a copy within FM Go and then send it back to Dropbox/OneDrive.  So many other IOS apps have Dropbox/etc integrated... and you'd think iCloud would even be integrated for an Apple-owned company ... but not so.  Needless extra work by the user to move the database to and from your IOS device.FileMaker's interface on the Mac does not align with Apple's `pro app' paradigm.  Its dated interface has floating inspectors and no full-screen mode.  Most strangely, it has just a single palette - the Field Picker - which uses the Pro App heads up display (HUD) graphic scheme of dark charcoal/black with white text.  Really odd.  I don't take any points off my evaluation for this.  It's just worth noting that from a UI perspective, it is as if the FileMaker developers don't follow what parent Apple is doing... and the product lacks overall quality control.FileMaker's help files and tutorials are far from Apple-like and make learning challenging.  Filled with FM-specific jargon and without index terms to standard database management concepts, it is a challenge even for an expert to migrate to the FM platform.  Looking at colleagues who would be casual users... the documentation is insufficient to teach them what they need to know.  The online knowledgebase articles are similarly not aimed for casual users.  All FM resources have insufficient  `how to' topics and no illustrated examples for specific needs and techniques and trade-offs.  It is as if they do not expect new users, but only long-time users who are upgrading.Bottom line:  see the third paragraph.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33XDTPO1FUWL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWH3CK0#wasThisHelpful","R33XDTPO1FUWL7","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had hand surgery this past February and couldn't type for 6 weeks.  Did I use Dragon?  No.  In spite of the amazing speed and accuracy of Dragon Dictate, it has too many usability issues for day-to-day use.  I used the built-in, offline dictation in Mavericks instead (fn-fn)... which allowed me to enter text absolutely anywhere.  Accuracy was perhaps 90% with OS X's dictation feature - but entering text anywhere without putting on a headset let me get through my day, even with small corrections.  I tried to use Dragon, but copying/pasting was just too much effort as you cannot simply place your cursor anywhere and start talking, and it was too much hassle to keep putting on and removing their headset.I gave Dragon Dictate 3 for Mac a 3 star review in November 2012: http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K8LO2C2CRSU/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009348X7QThe negatives beyond those mentioned in that review as I look at version 4.0 include:- 4.0 offers almost no new features.  The advertised transcription improvements did absolutely nothing to the audio on a video file, the same abysmal failure as I had in 3.0 with audio from a voice recorder.- 4.0 comes only on a DVD... yet no new Macs have optical drives!  (How do you say ""marketing idiots""?)  Often, software comes with instructions giving a link to a download page.  Not so with Nuance.  Even their web site offers no download link... although if you purchase at their website (for full retail), they send you to DigitalRiver for a digital download.  Duh.- 4.0 STILL does not recognize the microphones built into Apple displays!  Amazingly dumb that they cannot yet manage this - even though OS X itself can do voice recognition using those microphones.  My Apple LED Cinema Display microphone attached to a Mac Pro is not recognized by Dragon 4.0 ... I have to use a headset.- Nuance does not offer any upgrade pricing- The UI is so dated.  Clearly, Nuance has astonishing technology behind the scenes for the engine of this product... but they seem clueless for how to design a modern UI that interacts well with users and the OS X environment.IF you need to dictate long passages of text into Word, or to be pasted into an email, then Dragon Dictate continues to be astonishingly accurate and able to recognize your voice even when speaking very quickly.  But, if you are partially disabled - as I was for 6 weeks - and want to voice enter text everywhere - Google Search, Facebook comment, email reply, tweet, etc - stick with the OS X dictation and Accessibility features.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317NQA9PQOG5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP93PV4#wasThisHelpful","R317NQA9PQOG5J","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm totally pleased with the 2797LMT for what it offers, particularly in comparison the the 4.3 inch Nuvi 855 that it replaces.  Are there features I wish it had?  Of course.  But, it provides a stress free driving experience.My old Nuvi 855 is only just now 4 years old.  Feels like 10 years old.  The battery won't hold a charge and the cost of a map update and battery was more than a new unit with lifetime maps would cost.The 2797LMT's big, bright 7"" screen and large speaker makes seeing and hearing really pleasant.  The bluetooth pairing with my iPhone gave me better sound quality than a separate Motorola bluetooth device.  Traffic was good enough for a recent week-long visit to Columbus, Ohio where the 2979 kept me off congested roads.  New features over my old unit include being able to create your own avoidances.  A road was blocked for a fair, and it was simple for me to tap on the start and end of the blocked area to have the Nuvi route me around it in a variety of ways.  (It seems that the traffic radio should have 'known' that the road was closed for the 4 day event though.)You can tap on routes to see what the alternate routes are to your destination if you have a reason to choose something other than the default (based on your time or distance setting).  The ""Up ahead"" feature lets you find banks, gas stations or food options along your route... although I did find some of these were not truly along my route and would have caused detours.  Still, a big improvement over my old unit which gave no idea of if something was on your route.  Tapping icons on the screen gives more details on points of interest coming up, too.The lane guidance and split screens made navigating in a strange city easy.  I liked the tone and speed warning display before I entered school zones.  All voice guidance came at just the right time.  I thought I'd miss the old ""recalculating"" voice when I changed routes... but I actually didn't.  The Nuvi just very quickly came up with a revised route and kept navigating.Everyone else in the car loved the 2797 and one person plans on buying one herself now, or perhaps the 5"" version.The basics are done so well... that now I'm looking forward to a future with better internet connectivity.  The iPhone app lets you search and send addresses to the Nuvi... but doesn't support sending addresses received as texts, email, from a web site, etc.  And, while it lets the Nuvi display the weather... it will be great when it also provides information on POIs.  While we looked for places to eat every day, the Nuvi was of no help as it just has names and locations... if it tied into Yelp, we could have seen ratings and reviews and picked places without having to search our phones/tablets for information.  Sure, a phone-based navigation app might already provide all of that... but not with the large useful display and clear sound of the Nuvi.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJNZH53AWUST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXX0JOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XJNZH53AWUST","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is always forgetting where she left her purse, so we thought this would be a cool product.  It is somewhat useful - just not as useful as the manufacturer advertises.(Do note that this is Bluetooth 4.0 - so requires a device that supports that (iPhone 4S or newer, iPad 3 or newer, etc.)The 'separation' alarm only works if the app is running - makes sense.  But, there are all kinds of reasons including airplane mode when this may not happen.  You have to be so far away before the alarm sounds, that a purse could easily be stolen from where you left it at that point.The ringer in the device itself is the only thing we found useful in practice when my wife forgot where in the house she left her purse.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3L1BMMDAAP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK0ECYA#wasThisHelpful","R1J3L1BMMDAAP3","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bushnell has a known presence in both the optical and digital (e.g., Trophy Cam) worlds.It wasn't clear to me from the product description that this is a digital-only viewer.  Yes, there is a beautiful fixed optical lens  - but your only view through the eyepiece is of a low resolution 640x480 (VGA) LCD display.  The pixels are very visible, making it appear that you're looking at the image through a thick screen.There is no point in using this scope during the day.  Get an optical scope or binoculars, or even a good zoom camera for better results.Night vision is remarkable in its clarity and range.  Really bright looking at a hillside 100 yards from my house.  (This was my first infrared device...so a funny note was that I first tried to look through my windows and instead of seeing outside, I saw a perfect reflection of something else in the house.  Was a great verification that my new windows with a low-E coating do indeed reflect infrared radiation!)  As others have noted, the digital view is so bright, that my eye was blinded for quite some time after trying to see normally after viewing.  Definitely needs more fine brightness control of the display.Why 3 stars? --all of the oversights and limitations of the device, which has a list price of over $400.First, a little thing: no batteries or microSD card are included... which would have cost Bushnell just a couple of dollars.  Inexcusable at this price point.  I haven't had a microSD card since an ancient flip phone that is long gone and didn't buy one to complete this review.  The Equinox should accept standard SD cards.  With a memory card, the scope can take low resolution (640x480) pics and videos...grainy images that are not compatible with editing into any kind of modern HD video workflow.  The minimal resolution the device should have is  HD = 960 x 540.The button design.  You're using this at night, right?  So, you cannot see the buttons on top of the monocular.  So, there should be some kind of tactile ridges and dots on the buttons so that you can distinguish, by feel alone, which buttons are which.Battery compartment.  The manual illustrations show that the + and - orientation symbols are white on black to help you insert the batteries properly.  Mine were black embossed on black.  Pretty hard to see.  A further dumb design is that the compartment lid can be oriented incorrectly before screwing on.  You must carefully match the + and - on the lid with those on the body before screwing on the lid.Conclusion:  night vision is pretty cool tech, but this device rates only an ""OK"" (3 stars) for me based on the low res LCD screen, the use of microSD card (and lack of one in the package), the limited zoom, and the poor usability design (buttons, battery compartment, lack of reasonable brightness control).","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S82TBBA172PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9CDTZO#wasThisHelpful","R1S82TBBA172PP","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Kensington Keycover for iPad versions 2 through 4 is a niche product and I'm just not in that niche.  I tried to like it over several days with my iPad 3.My review unit arrived without any instructions for charging or pairing, although the instructions found on the Kensington web site could certainly have fit onto the box (3 sentences).  After charging, bluetooth pairing was easy.The keyboard is of course not full-sized (keys spaced the same as a desktop keyboard) - since the entire keyboard would then be larger than an iPad.  Anyone getting their first iPad keyboard should be aware of that.  Not a plus/minus affecting this review, just something to be aware of if you hadn't thought about it.The pros:Relatively lightweight (11 ounces)RechargeableHas a convenient row of function buttons at the top of the keyboardConvenient viewing angle when the Keycover is used on a desk.A real keyboard, for those who have problems typing on the iPad virtual keyboardThe cons:Does not protect the iPad - only the glass.  The back and sides of aluminum are fully exposed to get scratched (and mine did during testing).  The Keycover does not work if any other protective shell is on the iPad such as the Belkin Snap Shield Case Secure for the Apple iPad 3 (3rd Generation) (Black) - the keyboard cannot snap to the iPad, and the iPad with the shell cannot fit into the slot in the Keycover.  So, fully exposed aluminum seems the only option with this Kensington device.  That may be OK for you.If the Keycover is used on a surface other than desk height, the viewing angle is not ideal - and cannot be adjusted.If the Keycover is used in your lap, sitting or in bed, the iPad has a tendancy to pop out of the stand if you try to angle the keyboard for a better viewing angle.  There is very little physical ""purchase"" in the little plastic trench that holds the iPad.It takes two hands to unsnap the Keycover from the iPad to use the iPad with or without the keyboard, and two hands to snap it back on.The magnets that lock the iPad screen are only on one side of the Keycover - so the autolock function only works if you place the iPad in the Keycover with the dock connector on the right side of the keyboard.  There is only a notch for the dock connector to be accessible on the right side, so this makes sense... except that there is nothing to keep you from orienting the iPad the opposite way and neither locking the screen nor being able to plug in a cable.  I think the case should have been made symmetrically so that it didn't matter which way you placed the ipad glass against the unit.Personally, I can type quickly on the iPad virtual keyboard, but otherwise prefer a full size keyboard such as the Logitech Tablet Keyboard for iPad, iPad 2, iPad (3rd/4th generation), and iPad mini (920-004440).  It's bigger than the iPad itself and weighs 30% more than this Kensington Keycover, but is easily thrown in a bag with the iPad when going somewhere.If the iPad would stay securely in this Keycover during use, and if there was some film to protect the aluminum back of the iPad that was compatible with this Keycover, then I might actually use it.  Instead, I'll just pair it with my AppleTV and leave it in the living room.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPZ4C637X9BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEGS4R0#wasThisHelpful","R1OPZ4C637X9BV","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I requested a review unit of this TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 wireless adapter for use in an older Windows PC ... not realizing that that PC was so old that it did not support PCI Express.  So, lesson one is make sure you have PCI Express slots (vs PCI).  That older PC was easily added to our wireless network with a TP-LINK USB adapter, TP-LINK TL-WDN3200 Dual Band Wireless N600 USB Adapter, 2.4GHz 300Mbps/5Ghz 300Mbps, WPS Button, 802.1a/b/g/n, WEP, WPA/WPA2.I read other reviews here, as well as other sites, where people had successfully installed this WDN4800 adapter in their Macs, utilizing the built-in driver in OS X.  I finally attempted that today on a 2008 Mac Pro running OS X 10.8.3 (Mountain Lion).  I was initially stoked as the adapter was recognized when I powered on and turning Wifi on resulted in not only my network being seen - but distant neighbor's networks that do not show up on any of our other wireless devices.  So, clearly the antennas on this WDN4800 can pull in a signal.Unfortunately, that was about as far as I got (on my Mac).  When connected to either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, no web sites would show up.  Running Ping from Terminal showed that the connection was indeed live and pings were fast, but watching network traffic in Activity Monitor, there would be a short burst of data transfer followed by nothing, as if there were some kind of buffering conflict between the WDN4800 and OS X.  This is NOT something I can fault TP-LINK for!  They do not mention anywhere that the adapter is compatible with OS X and clearly in their documentation and web site only support Windows.I hope this information is useful to some readers - Windows folks assuring that you do indeed have PCI Express, and Mac users realizing that this card might work for some reviewers, but didn't for me.  I would not normally have submitted this review at all, except that the Amazon Vine program, under which I received the review unit, requires that a review be submitted.  I rated 4 stars so that my review does not affect the average review for the product; I would have rated N/A if that had been possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTV2Y5AKU2KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GMPZ0A#wasThisHelpful","R3NTV2Y5AKU2KT","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this series 30 years ago and looked forward to sharing it with my wife as we catch up on a variety of India-based dramas.  My memory was of a well-acted period piece with astonishing scenery that I never imagined existed in India, with minor historical insights through interesting and ambiguous personal stories.The reality on watching this in 2013 is that the quality of film and BBC productions today is so high, that Jewel in the Crown pales by comparison in every measure.  We laughed after each episode, saying ""Is that all that happened (in 50 minutes)?""  I'm not expecting an action movie but at least meaningful insight into people, etc.  Time literally slows to an intolerable pace.The actors are all quite good, while the script and editing create a jumble of disjointed plot lines and characters who come and go without ever really being developed.  As Great Britain loses her Jewel, no attempt is made to explain Congress, the Muslim / Hindu conflict or much of anything really.I agree with others on the poor transfer quality and lack of closed captioning.  It is so easy in a digital video editor to clean up the color and sound, and obviously A&E didn't put the least bit of effort into it.For its time, Jewel in the Crown was great TV on our old low-def tube sets with few quality made-for-TV options out there.

"In principal, Norton Hotspot Privacy should be something that nearly everyone with an IOS device or portable Mac or Windows computer would want.  (Strangely, it does not support Android devices.)  It really isn't a software solution, per se, as the operating systems include the key VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology already - it is really a subscription to a VPN service which allows all of your internet traffic to be encrypted so that nobody else on an open network can 'sniff' your data to obtain passwords, account numbers and other critical data that might not otherwise be sent securely.A one year subscription for up to 5 devices seems reasonably priced... if things worked well.But, I ran into the kind of 'version 1' issues that a company like Symantec shouldn't have, particularly on something that should be a no-brainer revenue generator for them. A little glitch in the setup process on my iPhone is that after entering the license key, there was no confirmation or any buttons for downloading the app.  Clicking the browser 'back' button gave me the download icons and a confirmation of the subscription.  A major glitch is that when I enabled the profile for 'manual' use of the VPN - a connection could not be made to the Symantec servers no matter how many times I tried (""Negotiation with the VPN server failed."").  The normal installation is 'automatic', which means that all traffic, even your Netflix movie, will flow through the VPN at slower speeds than a direct connection... since the connection is encrypted and relayed through remote servers.The 'automatic' connection profile, which automatically enabled the VPN for all internet traffic, initially prevented Mail from retrieving my Google Mail.  That turned out to be a useful security feature from Google.  But, I was not happy as I tracked down the solution.  Google sent me an email - which I could only get on my computer, as the VPN was blocking the iPhone - to tell me that my account was accessed by a hijacker at a particular IP address.  Following the instructions there, I went to the web mail interface and found that the IP address belongs to anchorfree.com - a completely different VPN solution provider who appears to not be associated with Symantec at all.  I trust Symantec, after many years of using their products, and expected to be using only Symantec servers.I'm not sure why the 'automatic' profile connected me to the VPN in any case, since I'm currently testing on a secured Wifi network, and the product advertises itself as only connecting automatically for unsecured networks.Because of the failure of the manual connection profile, I've uninstalled Norton Hotspot Privacy, and haven't even tested on Windows/Mac laptops.  I may reinstall when I'm at an open connection at an airport, etc., but otherwise don't want to be bothered with a flakey service that doesn't even use Symantec servers.PS I should add that it is ridiculous that Symantec packages this product in a large box when all it contains is a card with a license key and download instructions.  This goes for lots of other companies and products, too, such as Intuit's Payroll which is just an activation key.  The waste of energy for shipping and handling an empty box is a bit silly.UPDATE:  Since first writing this review, the responsiveness of the 3rd party servers has been fine, connections being made almost immediately on iPhone, iPad and Macbook Pro.  The 'automatic' setting still does not distinguish a secure or unsecured network and is always on.  The manual setting works fine, but there is no option to start in manual mode to begin with:  setting up Hotspot Privacy on a new IOS device puts it in always-on mode.  To change to manual mode, the app leads you through steps to uninstall one VPN profile and install another ... and guides you to where in the Settings app you would turn the VPN on and off.  This process is still too involved for some of my test users.  One noticed that her iPad was too slow at home after returning from a public campus hotspot ... but didn't know how to turn the VPN off to get full speed again on our home network.  The Macbook Pro setup is a bit strange - as the Network Settings on Mountain Lion doesn't show a VPN as having been installed, even when Hotspot Security is enabled.  Some magic is happening behind the scenes that cannot be monitored.  As with IOS devices, I like enabling the ""VPN"" icon in the menubar when the VPN is active for reassurance, and this isn't happening on 10.8.3 with the Norton product.UPDATE 2:  Another day, another story.  Was unable to connect to either the US or UK server with a dozen attempts over 30 minutes the other day.  Just not a dependable service.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P328QCIFK7UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YYZJDQ#wasThisHelpful","R1P328QCIFK7UI","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This TP-LINK TL-WDN3200 USB Wifi adapter is a bit large, physically, but comes with a USB extension cord in the even that either (a) the adapter doesn't fit well into one of your available USB ports, or (b) you need to reposition the adapter to obtain a stronger signal.Installation involves installing the driver/utility from the provided CD and doesn't require a reboot.  Within two minutes, your computer will be connected to your Wifi network.Ideal for any computer lacking but needing Wifi, even if only to eliminate cable clutter, the use of USB makes this adapter suitable with very old as well as current models.  My testing was with an old Windows XP box where I obtained 144 Mbps throughput.The software doesn't behave as advertised for me.  After I manually set up a connection to my hidden SSID router and checked the box to automatically connect, the connection was not restored after rebooting and I had to manually select the (single) connection item and click the Connect button in the software interface.

"This Bemis Mayfair 148E2 toilet seat offers the most solid installation hardware of the dozen or so seats I've put in over the years.  The bolts have an adjustable plastic collar that fits (snaps in my case) very snuggly in the hole in the toilet, eliminating the side to side wiggle of some other seat bolts that rely on double adhesive tape for security.  The 'nuts' are attached finger tight first (I had to lift the seat to most easily press the bolts in and get to the finger tight stage) - and then tightened with a 1/2"" wrench.  A cool thing about the nuts is that they cannot be overtorqued.  There is a snap off nut that breaks off when the tension is correct.  The remaining stem still accomodates a 1/2"" wrench for future removal.The removal-for-cleaning method is part of why this seat is more stable than some competitive seats.  A comparably priced plastic seat that I installed on another toilet has a snap in mechanism for removing the entire seat for cleaning (not that we do that much). You just pull the seat forward, and two clips unsnap from the hinges, leaving the hinges bolted to the toilet.  But, that seat has a fair amount of side to side wiggle because of those clips and different bolts.  This Mayfair seat actually unsnaps from the bolts, after twisting the locking hinge cover.  To return, snap the hinges back onto the bolt studs left on the toilet, and twist the hinge covers to secure.The quiet closing hinge avoids any slamming of either seat or lid.  You can just start closing and walk away.I've taken a star off because of the poor packaging by Bemis which resulted in a chipped seat on arrival.  I've uploaded photos that show the hardware bag placed loose in the packaging, bouncing around loose between the seat and lid.  One of the metal bolts chipped the edge of the seat.  The bag just needs to be taped down to the cardboard.I'm cautiously optimistic, but concerned by other reviewers for whom the seat broke after some use.  I'm concerned that the seat is 'molded wood' (meaning particles and binder) rather than solid wood like our old seat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3UH3FRQNFN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TD4QLM#wasThisHelpful","RX3UH3FRQNFN8","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received review units of the TP-LINK TL-PA511 today.  Do note that Amazon appears to be mixing reviews of various TP-LINK products together, do note that this review is for the TL-PA511.These powerline adapters allow you to run a 'wired' network connection to another location in your home using just your electrical wiring for the data transmission.  This is not a Wifi adapter.  The package comes complete with two short Cat5 cables.  Just plug one cable between your router and one TL-PA511 and plug the unit into a wall outlet.  Connect the other cable between your device and the other TL-PA511 and plug that unit into another outlet in your house.  Good to go without further configuration assuming nobody else on your same electrical meter is using this same technology.My router is in my basement and I've connected a DirecTV receiver in my living room.  The circuit breaker panel is at the opposite end of the house, so the total wiring run is probably about 100 feet.  The outlets are on separate circuits.  Throughput measures about 180 Mbps.Power consumption is stated as 6W per unit, so roughly $10/year for the pair.You can purchase additional units for additional remote devices; only one TL-PA511 is needed at the router.Depending on your needs, if you already have a good Wifi setup at your home or business, a Wireless Access Point might be a satisfactory and cheaper solution.  I'm able to get similar throughput with a WAP.There are some odd things about the software, documentation and device.  The software to configure the adapters for special security situations or to monitor speed only runs on Windows.  This is silly, as the device is operating system independent.  A web-based (operating system independent) configuration utility should be provided, as is the case with most wifi devices. The documentation calls this a Gigabit adapter - but of course the 500 Mbps peak is half a gigabit - and yet calls the Ethernet port a 10/100 Mbps port (rather than 10/100/1000).  The user guide is confusing, some due to bad English - for example, for quality of service settings (QoS) in the Powerline Utility, it says ""Choose what type of traffic you will user your local HomePlug AV device for by pitching on one of the four radils.""  (They meant to say clicking on one of the radio buttons.)  The user guide and short installation handout are pretty confusing as to how or why you would want to change the default security settings, which you would likely want to do if you are in an apartment/condo/office that does not have its own electric meter.Bottom line:  works effortlessly out of the box, more expensive than a wireless access point, potentially faster than wifi, software will not run on Mac OS X so Mac users should only consider this if you live in a private residence and will not need to reconfigure the units.  The Amazon product page indicates that a newer model is available now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O89VYAIRLIH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081FLFQE#wasThisHelpful","R1O89VYAIRLIH7","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Epson V370 scanner and software achieve remarkably good results, particularly for its low price which is achieved in part via fairly cheap feeling plastic construction.  (On the plus side, Epson notes that the plastic case is recyclable.)  Making this unit stand out from the crowd at this low price is that it is capable of scanning unmounted film (negatives or positive 35 mm) and mounted 35 mm slides using another light inside the cover, which is exposed by removing  the top document mount.I have almost no reservations at all recommending this unit for document scanning.  It is fast,  instant-on due to the LED lamp (vs old scanners which use fluorescents requiring warm-up), and gives quality results. For Mac users, do note that the buttons do nothing for you - as Epson has not gotten their Event Manager, which responds to the buttons, to operate on Mountain Lion for this device. So, document scan use requires launching the Epson Scan software to do the scanning. Personally, I get the most compact PDF files that have been also converted to searchable text by scanning with the Adobe Acrobat Pro File > Create > PDF from Scanner... command.  The Epson's TWAIN driver is recognized automatically by Adobe Acrobat Pro.The Epson software is a bit awkward (and with an ugly UI), and there is no user-manual.  As another review pointed out, you have to go to the Epson web site and view the documentation for another scanner to find documentation on using the software.  And even then, the documentation is web-only with no downloadable PDF.  The installation software installs a web link to the user manual for the unit itself - but the URL doesn't work.  You have to go to the Epson support site manually to get the link to display.  Pretty ridiculous to not just provide a PDF manual, much less a working link.  The software's settings panels based on a usage choice of ""Auto"", ""Home"", ""Office"" or ""Professional"" are pretty awkward - with some settings appearing in only one of each, where you might expect 'Professional' to include ALL settings.  The ""Home"" group seems oriented towards photos and slides; the ""Office"" group towards documents.For photo and slide scanning, the results are quite good if you are not a 'prosumer'  - and if you are, you wouldn't be looking at such a low priced scanner anyway, I would imagine.  Comparing the results to my Canon CanoScan 9000F Color Image Scanner which is just one step above the Epson, priced 50% higher and for some reason 50% thicker in size as well, the image quality of the Epson at first seems quite similar.  On close examination, though, all medium to dark areas of the Epson scans are filled with digital color noise - pixels of colors not related to the main color of the area.  In contrast, the Canon has none of this, with pure tones in all areas.  The Epson colors, even with color-restoration applied to old photos, seem much more like the original, which is a good thing, I think - while the CanoScan over-saturates.  Saturation is easy to fix;  getting rid of the color noise generated by the Epson scanner is more difficult and hence I cannot recommend it for people with a discerning eye.Scanning a 35mm slide at 4800 dpi took about 90 seconds.  The same scan on the CanoScan 9000F took 40 seconds.Removing the white document cover in the lid to expose the upper lamp for film/slide scanning is easy.  Replacing it is quite tricky, requiring aligning various bits.  (In contrast, the CanoScan 9000F document cover pops out and back in without much attention.)As another reviewer noted, it is annoying that the power 'cord' for this Epson is a large brick that makes the adjacent sockets of a power strip unusable, or which requires yet another short extension cord to plug it into a UPS battery unit.Dust and Scratch removal is via software, and appears to do nothing in my tests.  (The CanoScan 9000F uses an infrared dust removal process, but unfortunately, it doesn't accomplish much in my tests either.  Others have reported success with 3rd party scanner software with the Canon.)Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is made possible with the included ABBYY FineReader Sprint 8.0 which gave very good results in my test.One reviewer claimed that this scanner was completely silent.  Not true.  Like all flatbed scanners, it makes various whirring/whishing/buzzing noises as the optical reader moves across the bed.  To my ears, it is about the same as the CanoScan, but definitely quieter than the scanners built-into our four Brother and HP MFC units.Bottom line:  great value for office document scanning or home hobby photo/slide/negative scanning.  Woefully inadequate documentation; awkward software; scan buttons which do not function for Mac Mountain Lion users; power 'brick' awkward for plugging into power strip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQN4PPXSNEEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ZDCZ8Y#wasThisHelpful","RKQN4PPXSNEEK","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample unit of the WD10EZEX 1 TB 7200 RPM drive with 64 MB cache for review.  Formatting and testing it in an external firewire 800 dock on a Mac, it felt as warm (not hot) as a WD 'Green' drive, but was definitely a bit noisier:  there is an audible ticking sound during drive access that I don't hear with the Green line of drives.It seems a good value proposition for internal storage or an external backup drive, although I'm not sure I would have purchased it had I not been offered a test unit.  The Amazon price for either a 2 TB WD Green drive, twice the storage, or a 1 TB WD Black drive - higher performance and 5 year warranty - is not substantially greater than the cost of this drive.  Personally, I prefer WD Black for internal and the larger capacity WD Green for backups or media.  But, if you're on a tight budget, this drive is worth considering.The drive requires a special formatting utility download if you're running XP.  For OS X or newer versions of Windows, the 'advanced format drive' can be formatted properly by the OS.  For Windows users, WD offers a free download of a special version of Acronis True Image to allow upgraders to clone their internal drive onto this new drive to make it your new boot drive.

"My review below is mostly unchanged since the last release of Norton 360.  The product I was provided with for review this time, the 2013 Premier edition, differs from the standard edition of Norton 360 by including 25 GB of online (cloud) storage vs only 2 GB in the standard edition.  Considering that Symantec charges almost $60 just to add 25 GB to your Norton account, the minor price increase for 360 Premium makes it an economical choice for those people using the Norton online backup technology.Note that Norton's online storage is accessible only by its backup (and restore) component of 360.  You cannot drag and drop files there, as you can with other cloud storage services.  To email people links to files in your storage, you must use a web interface - but you cannot upload files there.Tip to all Norton users:  the LiveUpdate process does NOT download free product updates to which you are entitled.  From time to time, click on the Support menu and then ""Check for New Version"".  Even if you are running, say, version 2012, when version 2013 comes out during your 12 month license term, you are able to download and install it free of charge.The review:You probably know somebody that everybody in the family calls to fix their computers when they slow down or have problems.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  Now that I've (finally) discovered Norton 360, I'll be spending less time with the relatives once they buy copies.I've used Norton Internet Security for years and have recommended it often, particularly in recent years when Symantec made it run faster and leaner.  I never went for Norton 360 before receiving a review copy because frankly I couldn't really understand what it was from a quick glance.Norton 360 does everything Norton Internet Security (NIS) does, and more, but with a different interface.It includes firewall and antivirus protection as well as Identify Safe, identical to NIS.  (Your NIS settings and Identity Safe vault all migrate if you switch to 360 from NIS.)  Identify Safe is primarily a password manager, saving and entering your passwords for you under the protection of a single master password so that you are more likely to use appropriate, complex and site specific passwords for the web sites that you visit.360 includes features in two areas beyond NIS:  Backup and PC Tuneup.The PC Tuneup portion automatically cleans up things including:1. Removal of Windows temporary files (no more searching %temp%, %tmp% and all of the other places that these things hide)2. Removal of Internet Explorer temporary files3. Startup Manager - controlling the many hidden programs that launch when you start your computer.  Way easier than running MSConfig, the Norton 360 Startup Manager lets you mark non-essential startup items as ""delayed"" - so that your computer starts up in a jiffy, and then these things are launched somewhat later (reported to be 5 minutes) by 360 itself.  For example, there is a Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader item in most people's startup group.  These allow Office applications and Reader to launch faster when you need them, but at the cost of slowing down the time before you get control of your mouse when you start your computer.  With 360, you get your desktop sooner - and these things can still get launched, just a little bit later.  (Or you can disable them - which has no affect on the functionality of Office or Reader - just makes them launch slower.) Etc.4.  Registry Cleanup - the Windows Registry is a single, huge database that all software on your computer stores settings in.  The bigger and more cluttered it gets, the slower the computer runs.  360 can find entries for software that has been uninstalled and did not clean up after itself and tidy things up.5.  Internet Explorer history cleanup - nothing special, other than it can be scheduled to run at times you choose6.  Disk Optimization - defragmentation is essential to fast disk performance on Windows machines.  The defragger that comes with Windows itself is fine, but must be run manually.  The Norton 360 one can be scheduled to run automatically, eliminating the issue on most computers of the user either not knowing how to defrag, or continuously forgetting to do it.All of these tune-up activities can be set on a schedule to keep things running smoothly.Finally, 360 adds a Backup service that can backup via the internet to the ""cloud"", or to local media. This is useful and adds to the completeness of the product, but the user interface is so poor, that I take one star away in this review.Symantec gives you 25 GB of online storage with your Norton 360 Premier registration.  You can purchase more, but at a hefty charge relative to competitors.  You can access this storage through a Norton product or the n360.backup.com web site;  you would have to upgrade your license annually to maintain this 'cloud' backup.  But, the backup service can run automatically, incrementally uploads only files that have changed, and knows where they came from if you need to restore a file right back to its original location.  This is an excellent option for off-site backup of really important files that would make your life miserable if the disappeared in a  fire or explosion.  But, of course, it is slow to transfer large files.Note:  your files backed up to online storage are only as secure as your Norton account login password - hackers could try to access your files via the web interface which is accessed purely with your Norton account login credentials.  And, the web interface can be outrageously slow.  On the plus side, the web interface to your online storage has a search function so that you can quickly find the file you're looking for.  On the downside, the web interface is supposed to include a ""Purge"" command to allow you to delete files to free up space.  This command does not appear for me, however.You can also backup to thumb drive, optical media, a hard disk, or a network location (mapped to a drive letter).The negative about the backup system is that  you do not have a normal Explorer-like browser tree to select or exclude the files to be backed up.  Instead you have a horrendously ugly long scrolling list of full path names to files - no enclosing folder, nothing, to make it easy to browse and find files that you want to exclude/include.  There is not one person who I help with their computer troubles who would have a slight clue as to what these long file path names mean relative to their data.  I just don't know what Symantec was thinking of, putting this in a program otherwise designed for everyday Windows users rather than tech geeks.  It is not just this list, but the whole backup process which would confuse my less techie friends and relatives - they need a wizard to lead them through the process.One last thing I like about 360  is that in the Activities and Scans window, there is a checkbox to shut down the computer when activities are complete.  So, there's no excuse not to save energy when you leave the computer for the night - let 360 download updates, do backups and Tune-up activities, and then allow it to shut your computer down when it is finished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCC6EXGT0QZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TNCZNK#wasThisHelpful","R2PCC6EXGT0QZQ","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rhyming book is geared towards being read to very young children who will be interested in the illustrations and the cadence of the rhyme.  It feels over-priced at the retail price for the hardcover edition.  I found the illustrations, such as the buck-toothed boy watching the police horses, to be very 1950's in both style and coloring; this may be appealing to some and not to others.Anyone who ever had a working horse or team wearing harness will have a problem with the illustrations of working horses, most of which show incorrect harness and/or connections to the cart or sled.  Most of the other tack is close enough for a children's book.  The black horse on the police horse page (there are no page numbers) has its legs in non-horse places - both the left hind and the left fore are extended and off the ground.  After seeing that, I noticed a few other odd leg positions.The final page of the book, ""Popular horse breeds"", felt a little strange as it mixes true breeds with Palomino, a color; the illustrations did not clearly distinguish each breed, so perhaps the page is there just to introduce the words to the young horse lover.If horses are not a strong part of your or your child's daily reality, you may be quite happy with this book and not notice any of the hangups I have with the illustrations.

"I'm an expert Mac user and help a lot of folks from beginner on up, so I was hopeful upon receiving my review copy of this book that I'd find it useful.  But, in my opinion, it doesn't satisfy the needs of any audience particularly well.  The Introduction states that the ""book is designed to address"" all users:  ""new to the Mac"", ""new to computers"", ""Mac users who know the basics of OS X"", and ""experienced Mac users looking to see what's new and different in the latest version of OS X"".I think it is impossible to address the needs of all such audiences without an organization and layout that allows each audience to easily find and read the bits that pertain to them and their needs.  For example, the information specific to Mountain Lion could be called out with a margin graphic.  The little information appropriate for experts could be in sidebars.  Etc.Even if only one audience was picked for a revision of this book, the chapter organization just doesn't make sense to me.  For example, Chapter 14 on ""Using AppleScript and Automator"" beginning on page 249 of the 828 page book, and even the prior chapter about extending OS X with third party utilities, comes before the author even talks about using Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and so forth - a flow that would be bewildering to the targeted audience of ""new to computers"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWSW78T2GKVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118401433#wasThisHelpful","R3NWSW78T2GKVM","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're quite happy with this Logitech keyboard so far,  my wife preferring a physical keyboard to the IOS virtual keyboard for touch typing.  (I can touch-type fine on the iPad virtual keyboard - but have to admit, I can type much faster with this Logitech Tablet Keyboard.  No question about typing faster when the keyboard is paired to an iPhone.)I bought this on an impulse when it was a ""Lightening Deal"" - but would have paid the normal Amazon price,  having seen the quality and ease of bluetooth pairing.  Important to both of us was that the keyboard have the same key spacing as a normal keyboard.  (Some cases with built-in keyboards have tighter spacing which can be awkward.)Related, but off topic:  We recently received a Case Logic MLM-111 11-Inch Laptop and iPad Messenger Case (Ink)  - see my review there - and this keyboard fits perfectly in the padded slot intended for an 11"" Macbook Air - with the iPad (in case or smart-cover) fitting fine in the adjacent, padded iPad compartment.

"Designed for an iPad and optionally an 11"" Macbook Air  and accessories, this bag is perfect for those uses and my wife is quite happy with it.The interior is divided into three compartments, two of them well-padded.  An iPad, even in a case, fits perfectly in one.  My wife prefers a real keyboard for typing vs the virtual IOS keyboard, and the Logitech Tablet Keyboard for iPad 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and iPad Mini (920-004440) slides easily into the compartment intended for the 11"" laptop.  There's still room for my iPad when we go somewhere together.Additional compartments easily hold the iPad cord and charge block and earbuds or lay-flat headphones.  For air travelers, note that the Bose case for their QuietComfort headphones will not fit, but the headphones themselves (with lay-flat earpieces) fit fine and the flap still closes.The outer flap has a zippered compartment (padded) for a phone (or whatever).  An iPhone 4 in a (bulky) Otterbox case fits fine.  The body-side of the bag has an open pocket for mail, paperwork, etc.Attractively made from durable material and with a comfortable strap, my only disappointment is that the carrying handle is stitched in a way that is asymmetrical to the weight of the bag and the bag hangs awkwardly when that handle is used.  The magnetic closure is easy and fast and I don't have any concerns about the iPad falling out as it doesn't weigh enough to cause the flap to open even if the bag is held upside down.An excellent value (compare the price to the price for just an iPad case or cover, or an iPhone case), this bag is a good choice if its capacity meets your needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEYUSER64IRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OYYI8S#wasThisHelpful","RBEYUSER64IRE","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living Streets is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in or involved in the shape and function of our street-scapes, applicable to both urban and suburban (but not rural) areas.  It is up-to-date, covering current activities in a variety of cities, and providing web links to the resources related to those projects - providing quick access to the most recent information about them.The authors discuss the transformation of public rights-of-way that can build community, improve natural aesthetics, and provide improved and/or more relevant transportation flow.  The many examples and topics are written at a comprehensive but very readable level that is a little repetitive between chapters; that repetition, however,  allows chapters be read out of order and emphasizes the values to be considered.  There is guidance both to the design professional, as well as to the citizen activist.Like others, I was disappointed with the grayscale photos for a book of this price - and with such a beautiful color cover.  You can click on Amazon's ""Look Inside"" link at the top of the product page to see how this is laid out and if it bothers you.  Personally, I found that by the time I was halfway through the book, I was focused more on pattern and design and didn't mind the lack of color.  Yet, the book would have much more value with color images (or links to them) so that it could be more useful in persuading all of the stakeholders in a project to consider some of the ideas presented.The thing about the imagery that I found frustrating, was that the 'before' and 'after' shots were almost never from the same viewpoint.  Often times, 'before' had the camera aimed East (e.g.) and the 'after' was West.  Or 'before' showed an entire street, and 'after' was a close-up of tables on a sidewalk, with no idea of what happened to the overall road.  It seems that the authors relied on public photos rather than grabbing a camera and going out and taking matching 'after' images themselves.  The only accurate before/after shots were architectural renderings.I'm in the ""choir"" that this book is preaching to, which is perhaps why I enjoyed it so much and felt so encouraged by the projects described.  However, I live in snow county and I am disappointed that the authors do not recognize the huge issues that snow present to planning transportation corridors.  The only mention of snow is in a passing reference to alley maintenance.  Yet, snow removal is a real issue that can seriously complicate projects.  For example, the authors show projects that replace four lanes with three, two traffic lanes and a center turn lane (with associated pedestrian facilities, etc).  Yet, in areas of reasonable snowfall, plows must create a berm in the center of the roads, to be removed later.  The central turn lane, which otherwise offers so many advantages, fails here since the berm cannot go along either side (cars from that side could not enter the turn lane to turn), and cannot go in the middle (no cars could use the turn lane).  Snow removal in the created park areas, bike lanes, pedestrian areas, etc. is a serious issue.  I hope that it'll be discussed in the next edition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0ZPMA13N1RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470903813#wasThisHelpful","RX0ZPMA13N1RK","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was consistent Ravensberger quality to the pieces of this puzzle, with no dust, clean edges and only one slightly damaged piece of the 1,000.We completed the puzzle in one evening plus a bit the next morning over Thanksgiving week.  The semi-glossy finish to the picture side made seeing the details of the pieces difficult for me both in artificial lighting and daylight; but the others working on the puzzle didn't have any problems.  We all agreed that the final puzzle looked much better than the photo on the box.  Speaking of the photo:  we're not the hard-core types that do puzzles often and without looking at the box image.  The iPhone covering up the lower left corner of the image, and the banner covering up part of the lower right corner definitely made this more challenging than the last Ravensberger puzzle we did which had a full image on the box.On completion, we downloaded the iPhone app - which is a bit large as it includes images for several other puzzles as well.  The app is totally lame.  Holding your phone about 30"" away from the puzzle (which you've already identified from a list in the app), you hear birds chirping, suggesting spring or summertime.  Tapping over and over, more and more snow falls on the scene and frost forms around the image... but the birds keep chirping.  Stop tapping, or hold your finger down, and the snow goes away.  Yup, that's about it.  Maybe Germans are more easily amused than Americans.Ignoring the iPhone gimmick, this is an enjoyable puzzle with many difficult areas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMPLG8XH84OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ADIBXS#wasThisHelpful","R2UMPLG8XH84OY","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quickbooks for Mac has come a long way since my last  and not-so-positive review of the 2010 version.It's now stable, attractive and quite capable for many businesses.  If you have never used Quickbooks before,  give the Mac version a try for your business.  If your company deals with a single currency, is service-oriented, or if product-oriented has simple inventory needs, Quickbooks for Mac 2013 could fit your needs well.My wife and I still use Quickbooks for Windows on our Macs for about a dozen companies by running the Windows version under Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac.  But, for several of these companies, Quickbooks for Mac is now a viable option.  It still lacks the full feature sets of QuickBooks Pro 2013 [Download], much less QuickBooks Accountant 2013 [Download], which is why most of the companies we work with will stay on the Windows version for now in spite of the additional complexity of running Parallels Desktop on our Macs.Quickbooks for Mac 2013 permits batch invoicing (perfect for homeowner's associations and businesses that bill a group of clients a similar amount), payments via Intuit Payment Network (no monthly fee e-checks and credit card payments), and the ability to attach documents to transactions.  It supports up to 5 users on the same local network working in one company file at the same time (per-user licenses required), with user-permissions that limit what each person can see and do.  Since 2012, it has supported progress or phased invoices, useful for contractors and architects, for example.QBMac still uses the floating window paradigm, one which Apple, Adobe and others are moving away from for Mac applications  (e.g., Aperture, Final Cut, iMovie, iPhoto, Photoshop, Dreamweaver), but it remembers the last location and size of each window, so you can create a working layout of activity windows that suits your needs - you'll just see whatever other application windows are behind these as with all old-style Mac apps.The new Guide Me window automatically changes its content to reflect help and guidance for whatever you are doing, however many of the videos simply display ""Work in Progress"" when you click on them.  Some of those that do work have muddy sound and are compressed so much that you cannot read the screen text.A personal thing due to my age:  Most program text in QBMac is quite small on my 27"" Apple LED Cinema display which, as with most Apple laptops, has a higher pixels-per-inch PPI than older monitors.  I'd like to see Intuit give us the option of changing the type size, the size of which strains my aging eyes, even with special computer glasses.  It is the tiniest text of any program I work with.  (Palette text in some other programs is the same size - but not functional dialogs/windows.  My workaround is to drag QBMac onto an old secondary monitor that is 72 ppi.)  An exception to this is the left-column list of customer:jobs, vendors, etc in the Invoice, Enter Bills etc windows - this is extremely readable for me.  Registers, not so much.  I don't need any of Apple's 'Universal Access' features for anything else on my Mac, so adding 'zoom' or changing from non-native screen resolution just for QBMac is not something I'm willing to consider.For the few companies I have that would work with the feature set of Quickbooks for Mac, there are still small things that will keep me on the Windows version... but only because it's already running on my Mac.  If I wasn't already set up with Quickbooks for Windows, I might force myself to live with these issues in Quickbooks for Mac:1.  Consultants, attorneys, accountants, architects, graphics artists, etc. often like to record their time while the work is actually being done.  The QBWin Enter Single Activity window has a timer built-in.  It's so easy to start the timer and add additional notes as you work on a task.  If the phone rings, or you have to work on another task for a while, just stop that activity, to be returned to later, and start a new one for the phone call.  Etc.  When you return to an earlier activity, just start the timer again to continue on, adding additional notes and obtaining a total time entry for that one task which can later be transferred, with the notes (optional), as a single line to an invoice.  With QBMac, there is no built-in timer.  Instead, you must download the separate My Time application via the Customers > Time Tracking > Download My Time menu, and remember to refresh its lists every time you add or edit a customer:job or billable item (no dynamic linking to your company data).  My Time saves a separate time entry each time you pause it.  These entries can be merged when you export back into QBMac, but not with the same per-activity result as QBWin if you continue to add additional notes for what is intended as a single billable entry.  In general, I find having to launch a separate app (My Time) that requires management and export to keep the company file up to date an unnecessary additional level of complexity over time tracking within QBWin.  QBMac just needs to add a timer button to their Single Activity window, as has been requested for many years.2.  QBMac now allows very long Notes fields for time and invoice entries, and thus is able to import that data from a QBWin file without data loss.  (QBMac 2010, e.g., truncated all imported notes and did not allow data entry of long notes.)  However, none of those fields expands to show the data or displays a scroll bar.  For example, in an invoice, only a single line is displayed - making it nearly impossible to edit a multi-line note.  You can only see the multiple lines if you switch to preview mode - but you cannot edit there.  (This contrasts with the Windows version which wraps the notes in the invoice, giving a live, editable preview.)3.  QBMac doesn't work with Intuit's convenient GoPayment system unless you sign up for a merchant services account at a monthly fee.  For QBWin users, GoPayment is free of fees other than transaction fees.4.  QBMac still only works with Intuit's online payroll, which starts at $25/month.  This $300 per year compares to the street price of about $50/year for the basic 3-employee payroll for QBWin.  One company we have has a single part-time employee with under $4,000/year in wages.  The $300/year Intuit fee is just unreasonable for us.5.  Column width cannot be changed in forms (Bills, Invoices, General Journal, etc) - and thus complete data cannot be read.  For example, if you have nested subaccounts, you'll have no idea what the actual account is by viewing one of these forms unless you click on the account control. Ditto customer:job if the customer name is long.  Dynamic column resizing (and remembering user preferences) is essential (and works in the Windows version).Conversion of QBWin files to QBMac format improves each year, for those who are either migrating, or need to send their file back and forth to a bookkeeper or accountant on the other platform.  As always, it is important to know what things do convert and which things do not.  QBMac does not have a means of importing accountant changes or journal entries, and so if a file is sent to an accountant, the QBMac user must not do anything in their copy of the file until they receive the file back from the accountant/bookkeeper.  (This differs from the abilities of QBWin.)Bottom line:  Quickbooks for Mac 2013 is a solid release that can address the bookkeeping needs of many types of small businesses.  Intuit offers a free trial, and I encourage you to download it to see if your business needs are met by the product.  For myself, as a Quickbooks for Windows user who wants to switch, Intuit needs to resolve the issues in this review before I would migrate.  Naturally, I also look forward to the day that the Mac product achieves feature-parity with the Windows product so that we can completely leave Windows behind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPQBEIHH92962/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RA5EHY#wasThisHelpful","RPQBEIHH92962","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:17 MinsI'm incredibly impressed with the accuracy and speed of Dragon Dictate 3, after testing on a 2009 Macbook Pro with dual cores  and 8 GB RAM and a 2008 Mac Pro with 8 cores and 12 GB RAM, both running 10.7.5 Lion.  As far as I could tell, at most one core is used by Dragon Dictate, though.The attached video shows the speed of recognition after voice training by reading the phrases in just the first and simplest voice training scheme.  I read some paragraphs from an advanced equine anatomy text and everything was typed perfectly.  I was truly amazed, not just in comparison with Apple and Google internet-based recognition (which do not involve training) - but in comparison to the last time I evaluated speech recognition using a trained product, several years ago.The pluses for me include:1.  A profile is created for each user-microphone combination.  This profile can then be voice-trained by reading scripts to improve accuracy.  Five script scenarios are included, and all five can be done if one wants to really tune things.  I found amazing results after doing just one script.2.  Individual words can be added and trained, so that names and technical terms will be recognized accurately.  This is easily done via the Vocabulary Editor.3.  I can speak really quickly and the result is still accurate4.  Dictation can be into pretty much any application.5.  Voice commands can be used to control apps, but I have little personal interest in that.  It would be extremely helpful for someone with limited eyesight, coordination, or other physical limitations.6.  A variety of microphones, including smartphones, can be used for dictation.  Sound files from phones and voice recorders can be transcribed.  A corded USB microphone is included in the box.7. Efficient voice selection and correction of textThe negatives for me include:a.  Transcription of a sound file (from a voice recording) can only proceed if a profile (trained voice/microphone pair) is loaded.  Dictate will ONLY load a profile if the corresponding microphone is connected.  Tech support says this is as-designed.  But, it is incredibly stupid when the microphone is neither needed nor used during a transcription process.  The effect is that if you have a sound file containing someone else's voice, and they've trained a profile with a microphone that you do not have, you cannot transcribe the file.b.  Special vocabulary is saved per-profile, so you have to re-enter all special words (and then re-train) for each microphone that you might use.c.  The user interface seems really illogical.  I've attached an image to the product at the top of the page showing that there is a red 'Stop' octagon when the microphone is off.  Clicking it does not stop dictation ... it STARTS it.... turning the symbol to a green circle.  The green then means 'go' ... speak and Dragon Dictate will transcribe or respond to commands.  Clicking the green circle restores the red stop sign.  This seems backwards to me, but that's just me:  I would think that clicking the stop icon would STOP recording and clicking the green circle would START it.  If thinking of status lights, most recorders have a red light when they are recording / broadcasting and no light when inactive.  I can't get my head around what Nuance was thinking here.d.  A variety of actions in the tutorial would not function, particularly spelling mode.e.  It is challenging to type words that are also Dragon commands.  For example, whether I pause before and after ""new line"" or say it all together within a sentence, the words are never types ... instead a line break is always created.  I can fake it by pausing on either side of ""new"" and then either side of ""line"", but the instructions say that this is unnecessary.  Dracton Dictate has so many built-in commands, that you never know which ones will be obeyed versus typed, so you need to watch your output as you speak until getting used to it.  Personally, I'd like the ability to create a profile in which I disable all commands I never intend to use.Bottom line:Useful?  Depends on your typing skills vs verbal skills.  I can type extremely quickly and (usually) accurately and compose best while typing.  Others I know, while reasonable typists, think better when voicing their thoughts aloud, and one friend is particularly interested in Dragon Dictate to get some rough drafts onto paper because of her vocal process.  For those who are slow or poor typists, or who have some physical limitation, I think Dragon Dictate is an excellent value.  For those on Mountain Lion, which includes free internet-based dictation from Apple, the choice will be more personal.  The Apple dictation requires a live internet connection and is not voice-trained, and hence is less accurate; it also does not support voice correction or voice command.  There are audiences for the free Mountain Lion feature as well as for the more powerful Dragon product - I'd suggest first trying the free Mountain Lion feature and if it satisfies your needs, great; if not, take a look at Dragon Dictate 3.UPDATE 11/30/12:  I would take a star off this review based on the absolutely horrible Nuance customer support.  I've never encountered a more useless system - slow web response,  keeps invalidating my support account, preventing access followed by inability to re-activate the account with the logged cases...and staff which give stock responses that do not address the question asked.  Terrible customer experience leaving me feeling pretty negative about Nuance as a company.Latest tech support response (unbelievable to me):  Asking them why the built-in microphone on Apple's LED Cinema Displays is not recognized by Dragon Dictate, this is the response:  ""Dragon Dictate requires a mic that has a type that is USB. Go to System Preferences > sound > input. What is the ""Apple LED Cinema Display"" connection ""type?"". If it is not USB, What type is it?""  In other words:  they did not even test Apple's hardware for a Mac product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K8LO2C2CRSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009348X7Q#wasThisHelpful","R32K8LO2C2CRSU","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third Logitech Harmony remote, the most expensive, and my least favorite.  If I had purchased this, it would be on its way back to Amazon for a refund.  The functionality is that bad, for my usage.The significantly less expensive  Logitech Harmony One Advanced Universal Remote is a far more useful remote for me than the Touch, because it puts my most used buttons under my fingers where I can operate things by feel - particularly the play, pause, skip ahead (skip commercials), skip back, fast forward and rewind buttons.With the Touch, SOME of those buttons are at the very top, not within finger reach when the remote is held with the otherwise very comfortable curved back in one's palm.But, get real:  if you watch TV on a DVR  - you are using the 'skip ahead' button all the time to skip commercials, right?  On the Touch, that function is in a scrolling list on the touch screen.  Not only do you have to touch the screen once to wake it up  (no motion sensor wake-up like other Harmony remotes) - but you then have to actually look at the screen to be careful you touch exactly the desired command... if you're lucky enough to have the screen with that command displayed and don't have to go through menus to get it to show up.I could write pages about how poorly designed this Harmony Touch is, but I doubt if anyone wants to read it, so:Bottom line:Good:  if you have an existing Harmony remote, the MyHarmony web site transfers all of the functions from that remote to the Touch.  The remote feels nice in the hand, and they've moved the USB port from the IR transmitting end, to the opposite end, which might give better IR spread.Bad: basic functions are not within finger reach when held as designed.  Many basic functions have no physical button, requiring scrolling and careful touching of the right command on the touch.  Any screen command required at least two taps, as the first tap merely wakes the screen up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8106ALH6R3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EIUH6G#wasThisHelpful","R3N8106ALH6R3C","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Seagate Backup Plus 3TB USB 3.0 drive is an excellent value for the price - which at the moment is not significantly different than that of a raw 3 TB drive.  Pre-formatted for OS X, it works perfectly with Time Machine out of the box.  Additional Seagate software is included to allow use with a Windows computer, or for non-Time Machine backups.Seagate offers additional interface options for this drive - which appears to be identical to their GoFlex line.  For example, a Firewire 800 and Thunderbolt adapter are advertised as available, although nothing in the box points you to proper part numbers for ordering them.  Assuming that the Firewire 800 adapter is the same one Seagate has used for the last couple of years, I would recommend against that as there are many reported problems with it.  USB 3.0 with any new Mac supporting USB 3.0 is faster than Firewire 800.  If you have an older Mac, this drive, like any USB 3.0 device, will operate in the slower USB 2.0 mode.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H62VDTIKVEGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HQHPC4#wasThisHelpful","R2H62VDTIKVEGC","AO2EURP2Y4JZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2EURP2Y4JZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was a nice width and my husband liked that part.  He is not a fan of this type of buckle but that didn't figure into the rating at all.

Wearing this makes me feel safer since I have a friend who was horribly injured riding a bike home from work late at night (was hospitalized 3 months and another 6 before he could go back to work.)

" 2:12 Mins I like to think of myself as a good cook, and I love to eat good food.  One of the things I've learned over the years is that seasoning can take the worst cut of meat and make it seem gourmet.  I've recently discovered different kinds of rock salt that tastes amazing on food, and I love this particular grinder set because it is easy to fill and easy to hold.  It holds a lot more of what you are wanting to grind also, so you don't have to fill it as often.  It also looks good on the dining table or on the counter (I keep mine on the back of the stove).

"I haven't always lived the healthiest life, and one of the things I've learned is that my hair is the greatest reflection of my overall health.  At 52 I probably keep my hair longer than I should, but I prefer it shoulder length, but because my health hasn't been the greatest, most of my hair is pretty dry and fly away.  I try to use good products on it, but even after using natural conditioners and masques, I still have some dryness that just doesn't always look good (or professional).  I have been using this Macadamia Hair Oil Treatment, and while I know that nothing can 'heal' damaged hair, some products can help it look better, at least for a day or two, and this is one such product.  I don't use it exactly as intended, but as a smoother.  What I mean is that after I dry my hair, I rub a dime size portion of this oil between my palms and smooth it over the worst parts of my hair.  I've been getting compliments from co-workers (It must have gotten bad if they notice an improvement).  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5?  The smell.

Now, if you've done any grocery shopping lately, you know that the price of beef is astronomical, and as such I didn't want to risk over or under cooking these expensive cuts of meat. This cooking thermometer is extremely easy to use, and when I thought the steak was done, I used this to test the internal temperature of the meat, and it was slightly under-cooked (I got thick cuts of Rib Eye), so I knew to keep it on the coals for another minute or two.

"I work at a local community college, and while I am frequently running in between my office (a generous term for a very small cubicle), I don't always remember to bring change for the vending machines.  A couple years ago, my husband installed a mini fridge for me, but it finally died this year so I've either been drinking water from the fountains, or coffee, but haven't really had a way to keep soda cold (and buying it from the machines at 1.50 each just isn't cost effective.  So when I received this I was happy because I don't really use the fridge for anything but soda.  This works great for that, and if I've only got a couple cans in it (which is normal), I have room for a sandwich.  I haven't used the car charging function, nor have I used the heater function, but for what I need this is ideal.  It doesn't take up near the space the mini fridge did, and can fit in the corner of my desk (I also get a lot of attention from co-workers for the retro look of it).

"This is a decent power strip for travel, although it doesn't quite have the quality that I like for everyday use.  I like that the cord wraps and that it comes with a travel bag for easy packing.  I like that it has 4 charging ports, as I usually have at least 3 items that need to be charged using USB, however, only one of them is over 1 Amp, so those will be slower.  I would love one of these with at least half of the ports being 2.4A.  However, the convenience of taking this with me, the fact that the cord winds up (albeit not always as neatly as I would like), and the carrying bag makes this a winner overall.  The housing is plastic, and not the sturdiest, but figure the convenience, the portability and the price, I can't complain too much.

"I never thought I would like a dry shampoo, but I recently went through a pretty bad injury and bathing and showering was more difficult for awhile.  I can sink bathe pretty easily, but shampooing my hair for about 5 days was darn near impossible.  I had received this and just never found a good time to test it, but after 4 days of no hair washing, I needed something.  I sprayed this through my whole head of hair, and fluffed my hair up, almost like I was shampooing wet.  Then I let it set for about 5 minutes before brushing my hair thoroughly.  My hair wasn't 'clean' per se, but it looked better and cleaner than it had.  I'd also read that many dry shampoo leaves a white dusty residue on the hair that is difficult to get off without wet shampooing, but I didn't see any of that when I used this product.  Granted I have quite a bit of gray (especially at the roots), so it may just not have been noticeable on my head.  Regardless, my hair looked better so I didn't feel as icky as I did, and I only had to deal with it another couple days til the pain of my injury allowed me to shower normally.  I also loved the fragrance of the shampoo and conditioner set, it was subtle and not too perfume like.  All in all a great experience.  I don't plan to use this often, but if I need it, and can't, for whatever reason, manage a normal shampooing, I'm not afraid to use this now.I received a discount on this product in exchange for my review.

"I received a sample of this car adapter/hub to review and I've seen quite a few different car adapters.This one ""is"" different though.  It has 4 ports in it which in itself is different than any other I've seen and when tested, all four ports charged both my LG G2 cell phone and my Nexus 7 Tablet quicker than most I've tried.  I don't have the tester that some folks use, I am not that tech savvy to be honest, but I am a consumer, and my experience is telling me that this works faster than most of the others I've used.  The fact that it has 4 ports in the one cigarette lighter spot is also important because it helps save space in my car, and it seems I am continually juggling cables to keep all my devices charged.  This will let me charge my phone, tablet, GoPro and sometimes my Bluetooth headset.  It barely affects my cup holders (another bit of prime real estate in my vehicle) so that is another plus.

"My husband and I recently moved into a new home, and are very excited about having a real house to light up for the holidays this year.  My biggest concern was that our electric bill would go through the roof, but with this string of lights at least, it is solar powered, so no worries on that account.  This particular string is 40 feet long (about 13 yards) which is the perfect length to outline one of our outbuildings.  I love it.  The power lasts long enough for us to enjoy it in the evening (even after a rainy day which we have had a ton of lately).  It doesn't last all night, but lasts long enough for the purpose it is being used for.  We haven't had a fully sunny day since these were installed, but even on overcast days it collects enough of a charge.  It has several different modes so we can have it flashing or fading.  I'm very thankful that it is waterproof as well, as that has been an necessity in North Carolina recently.  There are 10 clips for installation (we had some from another string of lights as well) so it was fairly easy to install (I let my husband do it).  I'm thrilled with this and they look great.

I am a tall woman at just under 6' tall so the fact that the length on this rope was adjustable was a great appeal to me.  Adjusting is very easy, and this jump rope turns smoothly.

" 3:57 Mins It has been years since I've had a compact all-in-one sewing kit.  I usually end up buying a spool of thread, or a package of needles when I have mending to do, but it is really nice to have everything I need in a nice kit, that I can keep in one place and know where to find it!  This comes in a nice nylon zippered case (in purple which I love, but it also comes in black and dark blue).  This kit comes with snaps, safety pins, a tape measure, a variety of sizes of needles, a small pair of scissors, a seam ripper, a fabric pencil, 11 small spools of thread, a different type of thimble than I am used to (but it works), and two little plastic cases: one with a variety of straight pins, and the other has smaller safety pins and a few odds and ends of buttons.  There is also a device called a needle threader, but I must be honest that I have absolutely no idea how to work that.  But even without it, this kit ROCKS and has everything I need (except for a needle threader I can figure out).  This is great for anyone, and in this throw-away culture we live in, it is nice to see a product that will help me conserve and save perfectly good items that simply needed a little mending.I received a complimentary or discounted sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BDS9T8N02A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BPWRO#wasThisHelpful","R20BDS9T8N02A9","ATJQIZDDMLIFC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQIZDDMLIFC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:47 Mins My husband's birthday is coming up and when I got the opportunity to receive this watch at a discount, I jumped on it.  We are both in our 50s, and while we consider ourselves up on all the latest technology, when it comes to some things, old-fashioned is our favorite way to go.  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry, well made and works flawlessly.  It is easy to set, the date is in English and Spanish (we only need the English), and even comes with a tool so that we can adjust the watchband to fit him perfectly.  I didn't even need to shop for a gift bag, because it comes with that, a certificate of authenticity for its Swiss workmanship, and it is ready to go.  The box it comes it is very sturdy, and I am hopeful that my husband will like it as much as I do.I received a discounted sample of this product in exchange for a review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZOO7RLO244HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FMU7EG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZOO7RLO244HQ","ATJQIZDDMLIFC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQIZDDMLIFC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We got this portable when we bought the Oreck XL and it is the handiest vacuum cleaner ever.Way more powerful than its weight would have you think and the extension wands and tools let you clean baseboards and between cabinets and appliances easily. Very easy to vacuum the stairs when you can hang the vacuum cleaner on one shoulder and put a wand on to keep you from having to stoop over.The bags are cheap and easy to replace, which is good, because this little thing pulls up more dust and pet hair than you even think is there, and the bags fill up fast. I love this vacuum cleaner!I like using the cinnamon scent tablets in this vacuum, too - the floral ones I tried aren't so great, but the cinnamon is nice.We're at eight years on our Orecks and they're still both powerful and working well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJROBLOVH5E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AAJVC8#wasThisHelpful","RJROBLOVH5E8","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I see people calling it ""discomfort,"" it reminds me of Lamaze classes where the instructor calls labor pain, ""discomfort."" The truth is that the pain is so bad sometimes, it makes me nauseated.I use cotton balls soaked in witch hazel on the external ones and that is more helpful than anything else I've ever tried. But it doesn't help the internal ones.These do. Not instantly, but when you're in agony and suddenly you're not, it feels instant.Keep them in the freezer, open them into a little baggie of ice and don't touch them until you're ready to use them because they melt fast from the heat in your hand.No more sitting on ice packs for hours. No more $90 prescription foam. No more of any of the other things I've tried. The relief from this is just as effective as all of them.Never want to run out of these.

"A Winter Frost service for 12 has finally dwindled down to just a few pieces left - after more than 19 years.I'm replacing them with same exact thing because they're beautiful and durable.

They go with everything, no designs to hide food remnants, dishwasher safe, microwave safe, tough as nails.I dropped a stack of plates on a tile counter once and there was not even a chip or scratch on any of them.When you do drop and break them from a greater height, they shatter into a bazillion very sharp pieces, so you don't want to be barefoot in the kitchen.

"I bought the Ultimate system at a quilt show in both the blue and the white iron-away type and the system IS very easy to use.The problem is that when you're quilting, the vibration of the needle hitting the quilt is enough to rattle the particles away, first making them blurry, and after a minute or two, anything within about 6 inches around the needle is obliterated. Quilting complicated designs is frustrating, even in bright light and wearing strong reading glasses.It works great for simple lines and small, single motifs. I tried to mark a whole border and ended up going over it with a Chaco liner tool just to get that border done.Better to mark your design precisely with something that stays put or memorize your design before you quilt it. If you try to mark your whole quilt with this, you are wasting your time.For me, the Frixion fine point markers and Frixion highlighters have been the real miracle tool for marking quilt designs, garment construction marks, embroidery guidelines and designs, etc.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R270LTK0PL67BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JS55OY#wasThisHelpful","R270LTK0PL67BA","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first time took some fussing, but then I figured out how to fold them and make them fit. And now I have clamps to put over them and hold them tight to the nails.I think these wraps are tailor made for people like me, who rarely strip off the gel down to bare nails. Even using half a set at a time to do both hands, it would be pretty expensive to use these every day or two.The thick pad holds a good soaking amount of acetone. I take them off halfway through (after about 5 minutes) to remove the loose polish and add more acetone for another 5-minute soak.Holds the acetone where you need it and you're not tied to a bowl of remover while it's working.

"I love this stuff. Like PB Blaster, it softens up decades worth of hardened 3in1 oil, lint,  dust and grime from the insides of my antique sewing machines and makes them run smooth as new.Sprayed onto a rag, it cleans the exterior of the machines - stay away from decaled designs. Just magically removes decades of old oil and dust.Loosens stuck screws - though not all. I gave up on one and basically mauled it into submission with a SpeedOut and visegrips. Another one felt like it was welded in and was starting to strip, but between Liquid Wrench and PB Blaster applied every day for a couple of weeks, it finally budged and a few hours later, came free.But, this is still a favorite for general cleaning and loosening up of old, gummed up works. Scrub with a brass (on bare metal) or nylon (on black shellacked parts) brush, wipe it all away with acetone or denatured alcohol.  When everything is clean and the gunk is gone, you can wipe everything down with plain sewing machine oil and put a drop at every metal-to-metal point and the machine will turn as smoothly as the day it was made.The only thing I don't like is there's something grey in this, where PB Blaster is clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQZURTDD15GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZZWNYG#wasThisHelpful","R2AQZURTDD15GC","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The gel will not smudge or streak - It just floats away in little threads.You can get this exact same product a lot cheaper - except for the different packaging, they even smell identical.

"Beautiful little book that I will definitely keep. The basics for several different methods of appliqu are included - invisible machine, needle-turn, wool - lots of fun!I know lots of people call appliqu,  ""the 'a' word,"" and even though they love the look, they think it's too difficult or time-consuming, so they put off trying it. That was me - I wouldn't even look at a pattern for appliqu because I thought that that was for advanced quilters. I missed out on a lot of fun and avoided some really wonderful patterns because I was afraid of it.I finally tried it a few years ago and found that I LOVE starch-prepared and needle-turn appliqu. Then I went to a class by Kim Diehl and learned a whole bunch of new tricks to speed up my work.Best of all, I learned how to do her method of invisible appliqu by machine and ohmigosh, is it ever terrific! The crisp edges you get from starch-prepared, and the speed of application is phenomenal! The appliqu looks like precise needle-turn when it's done. And because it goes so fast, you're going to finish a lot more projects!She shows you how to add trapunto for dimension and charm, too. So pretty!There's a section on fusible appliqu, which is probably the least intimidating method and great for quick projects that are going to get a lot of laundering and use.There's one pattern for a sample project in the back for practicing the different methods and a couple of layouts for different ways to display your new addiction.This is a techniques book, rather than a pattern book - if you're looking for step by step how-to, this is it, but if you already know all the how-to and seek a pattern book, this well be far less interesting and useful for you.The whole book is full of hints and good advice - and gorgeous photos of Kim's beautiful work, both finished and in progress.

"I LOVE these strips. It's worth it to fuss with them a bit to get them on straight because you will more than make up that time when you're cutting strips.Make sure your ruler is clean - wipe it with an alcohol swab/lens cleaning tissue to get skin oils off of it. Don't handle the strips until you're ready to use them and make sure that your hands are clean and dry.Peel a strip off the backing and hold it by the ends in one hand with the adhesive side down - in a ""u"" shape. Drop the middle of the ""u"" on the line you want to cut along and with a finger on the other hand, press the middle in place. Then a little on each side, making sure that it all stays aligned. It only takes a couple of minutes.You can cut a LOT of fabric - eight or ten layers at a time - with these strips in place. The ruler aligns itself very accurately and instantly - whoosh. Take away the cut strips and align again.And you don't have to pull them off if you need to cut a different size - just lift the ruler and set it down on the measurement that you need. I actually like these things in place because they really GRIP the fabric underneath to prevent slippage while cutting.

"These are fantastic little lights if you have machines that are not lighted adequately, but in order for a magnet to function, you must give it something that contains IRON for it to attract to!It's not the lamp's fault that your plastic machine won't hold on to it.The solution is very simple - buy a little steel washer or screw plate at the hardware store and glue it to the back of your machine or work table.OR buy a thread cone stand with a cast iron base and stick the magnet part to the base.OR use a Command Strip to attach the flat part of the magnet to a flat part of your machine or the table behind it.It's not fair to the product to leave bad reviews for your own lack of understanding about how magnets work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLNOK3EC60SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X24VWY#wasThisHelpful","R3LLNOK3EC60SW","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be trivial to add a true 1/4"" and a generous 1/4"" line and hole to this tool, making it more versatile.The Qtools Corner Cut has all three, so it's the better choice for a quilter's seam measurement tool.Even better if they'd add 1/2"" and 5/8"" markings, so you don't need two separate tools for quilting and apparel sewing.Still a good idea and nicely made.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3J5NEWVQ7DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KYYN82#wasThisHelpful","R1X3J5NEWVQ7DS","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why the company calls this a picot foot, because it does not make anything like a picot edge. If you look at the YouTube video for this foot, the result is so messy looking that you wouldn't even buy it, and that's a shame if you like heirloom sewing by machine.What this foot does is a shell edge. For vintage zigzag machines, it was called a shell hemmer, and it's used with fine fabrics and the mirrored blind hem stitch to create a tiny scalloped effect on rows of tucks or the edges of collars, hems or trims for women's clothing, lingerie and baby clothes.You set the stitch length to give you the width of scallops that you want and you may need to tighten your needle thread tension a bit in order to make the scallops deeper or more pronounced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D44GXZJG5K4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NQN6AK#wasThisHelpful","R3D44GXZJG5K4K","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazon price is a little expensive for five strips of plastic, and the strips are not very reusable.That said, this is my favorite seam guide.I cut them in half, so I get 20-30 uses from each package. When the sticky back gets linty and doesn't stick well, you can rinse the back with plain water and let it air-dry. Don't scrub, or the adhesive will be removed.Once you apply the strip to your machine (assuming that it's clean - free of oils and lint) it will stay put for hours and hours of piecing, which helps you keep your seam allowance consistent throughout your quilt top. I usually use the qtools Corner Cut to measure a scant 1/4"" and lay the strip right next to the Corner Cut and press it down.Once you remove it, it doesn't stick as well as it does the first time, so I try to get it exactly where I need it on the first try.There is another brand of adhesive strip that will take the paint and shellac off of your vintage machines, but this Sewing Edge hasn't ever damaged any of my machines.It's low profile and firm, so you can use your fingers to keep the fabrics lined up perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCO7HUD13P1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617451932#wasThisHelpful","R3LCO7HUD13P1E","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I used this, I was able to get the strip applied properly on the first try, thanks to the excellent instructions.The next morning, I had no pain in that toe from ordinary walking, and by the third day, my dog stepping on my foot didn't hurt, where it had caused pretty significant pain, just a few days before.Two weeks later, there was no tenderness at all and I could wear closed-toe shoes. This is *without* digging under the corner of the nail and cutting that prong off at the quick, which I normally have to do every 2 or 3 weeks.It came off after about two weeks and the trouble started with the second application. The glue bottle was welded shut, despite my careful cleaning of the glue tip after the first use. I have yet to find a super glue which does not do this. I usually buy super glue 3-packs at the Dollar store and once they're opened, I consider them disposable.Not only does the top weld itself shut, but this glue begins to change when it comes in contact with air, gradually losing its effectiveness. Since I resorted to unscrewing the top and dipping the end of the cotton swab into the bottle to apply the glue, this chemical change is probably going to happen a lot more quickly.I could not get the brace to stick, despite using the same amount of glue as the first time. It took several tries and finally worked when I used a little more glue.Next time, I will try a fresh tube of super glue, or maybe experiment with the gel form.Overall, I'm very happy with the way that the brace worked and relieved to be out of pain and able to wear my regular shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13U83NTGKUU0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OYKE6A#wasThisHelpful","R13U83NTGKUU0I","AN3BXZ2AZ28ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN3BXZ2AZ28ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this stuff for refurbishing antique sewing machine parts.The nickel plating is usually at least a little pitted, allowing the steel underneath to rust.Soaking those parts won't remove the plating, but it removes all the rust *plus* the years of old oil and dust that have turned hard and orange and is so hard to remove with other methods. I'd much rather use this than acetone, even though acetone is a lot cheaper.The parts are ready to buff and wax after soaking, unless the rust removal uncovers much worse pitting, which might call for removing the plating. I have found that more with the old handwheels and some slide plates, where taking them down to steel looks nicer than leaving the nickel plate.I also used this to clean up a ""widow's mite"" bronze coin - It was so corroded, it looked like a little rock, but soaking for a few weeks and brushing with a toothbrush every few days, all that corrosion soaked off enough that I could see the design.But, now I have a real rustbucket of a machine that I'm just going to immerse, so I need the 5 gallon size.

"I have this booklet in print and Kindle editions because it is so helpful in those times when I am ""stuck"" or too distracted to focus properly.This rosary contains all twenty mysteries, and each mystery is accompanied by a masterpiece illustration and a meditation. Far from a lecture, the meditations are short enlargements on the statement of the mystery, two or three paragraphs, each. They provide much food for thought, applying the mystery to our own lives or pondering the mystery as it was observed by Our Lord's Blessed Mother. You can even course one sentence at random from the paragraph and meditate on it through the prayers for great reward.All of the traditional prayers of the rosary are included.There are several short articles about the benefits of praying the rosary and the transformations it can bring about in our lives.I try to buy these booklets in bulk, to give someone when I give them a rosary.

"I had high hopes for this light, as I had always wanted one for various precision tasks.  However I have been disappointed.ASSEMBLY:This light is heavy.  I was amazed at the weight of the box.  There are 2 pieces (base & arm) and two screws along with 2 allen wrenches and the cord.  To assemble the top to the base was interesting to say the least. It was a 2 person operation for us.  To hold the base on the side as the instructions suggest and align the arm of the lamp in any position is impossible.  It took us nearly 15 minutes to put the two screws in to assemble the light to the base.  We did that by one person holding the lamp upside down and the base on top of that with the other person doing the screws.USAGE:Since you use 2 screws to hold the lamp in the base, it cant pivot there.  That was a major problem for usage.  If you want to use the lamp at a desk, or workbench, it has to be exactly aligned to the back or side of where you want to use it, because it wont pivot.  The second joint, the elbow is limited to only bending as well, you cant twist there either.  Imagine a > symbol.  It can go up and down only.  Finally the wrist joint, can rotate around the axis of the arm and bend up and down.The light is easy to turn on and off.  Seems to from Off, to Maximum brightness.  To reduce light, you have to tap the -.  To increase tap the +.  I was hoping you could slide. If the light is turned off when it is at a lower level, that is the level that it comes back on at.5X sounded like a good magnification until, I used it to look at coins.  My old eyes (Im in my 50s) would like more magnification and this is with my reading glasses on. However looking on the web, this is a common magnification for this type of magnifier.ACCESSORIES:I saw some reference to accessories, such as an arm that would help add the pivot option, but dont have that documentation right here, so I figured I would just look it up on the internet under Black & Decker.  Cant find this product even.  Maybe its too soon, but since you can buy it today it should be listed.  Would also like to swap out the magnifier for a higher value one, but dont know if that is possible.WHAT WOULD MAKE IT WORTH IT TO ME?I want a pivoting base. If you have to make it heavier fine.I would like it to be easier to assemble or come pre-assembled.And I wish I could swap out the lens for a higher power one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XDJHQSB0ZVMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW75FY#wasThisHelpful","R2XDJHQSB0ZVMF","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never read a graphic novel of this type, I was unsure what to expect.  What I did find was a pleasure to view and read.  This is a fairly large format book, so it is heavy.  A single-hand hold when reading will fatigue you.  But, this is my only negative.  Im sure the large format made the artwork inside more compelling, or at least I thought so.If you read magazines like Discover or some science-based other magazine the content of this book will grab you with its meandering stories of locales, people, etc. and the effects of weather on them. There are several sections each covering an aspect of weather, such as wind or fog and in these sections stories related to this phenomena.  Essential bits and pieces that capture the essence of this weather fact. It is not comprehensive by any means but just facts and info that caught the authors fancy to include.The artwork relates to the stories within.  Some of it very involved and some simple such as an entire 2-page spread that captures that azure blue a sky gets on a warm and humid day.  All the artwork is in a cartoon or caricature type of style, befitting a graphic novel.

"Reading this and having  heard of various movie stars home life, the drug use and the lack of parental guidance, was not a surprise. However, Kelly Carlin herself, is at times not a very sympathetic figure.  She was nearly in her 40s before she even considered that she needed to be a contributing member of society. But, maybe in making her story so transparent, this is her redemption.She clearly can write.  This book is evidence of being able to do that.  It flows; though the narrative at times is of a spoiled Hollywood brat. George her father and her mother, did not have their act together in the parent role.  George was the typical artist obsessed over his craft and his wife, his enabler in that craft. It seems raising of Kelly was an afterthought..  Parenting is hard work and they sucked at it.  Limits that would normally be on a child, were absent, as the self-control was not to be had for these two parents, themselves.  One was a major drug abuser and the other an alcoholic.  It is no wonder the daughter was aimless, there was nothing to strive for. If she wanted something Daddy gave it to her.  That is except, much of his attention.  When she got that the sun shone and all was good.  That is true of most children and especially those of absent parents..You can see George had quite a shadow cast. It did not seem he shared his spotlight ever, until much later in life in an interview with his family as some stars do.  But based on what I recall of Carlin, his comedy was who he was, not just a role he played.  Hard to share that.When she writes of her Moms death and quitting her job to care for her.  She is lucky she did not have to choose between this care and a job that she needed to support her family.  Most of us would be torn apart, due to the lack of income and the need for care.  However the never-never land of caring for a terminally ill patient did not spare her its unceasing hopefulness/hopelessness and the mind-numbing tasks.  But, unlike us, after her Mom passed she was not able to move as easily beyond, as she had the luxury and curse of time on her hands.Later, she decided to try school, psychology, as she felt she needed help there herself.  Though she was going to school as a counselor, she expressed no desire to help crazy people.  However to complete this degree, she had to and it seems she found her niche.  I have a colleague who went into psychology and had the express opinion, that the people that needed the help the most were the ones that went into the training.  He did not excuse himself from these ranks and it would seem this was true for her case as well.  Later however she ditched licensed counseling for her pursuit of performance, becoming instead a life coach, so it did not interfere.Though I laughed at the start of this schooling when she indicated trepidation about taking on a 40K loan for her education, as several of the cars her father gave her, plus also the houses made that seem like a drop in the bucket.  But, I give her credit for pursuing some worthwhile pursuit, though it seems she ditched it ASAP for performing.  She cant compete with her father as there is only one George, but I think she finally realized there is also only one Kelly.Overall this was a good book and as another reader pointed out, this is a book about Kelly, the daughter of George and this is what it is supposed to be about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SQMEI8KG3XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250058252#wasThisHelpful","R22SQMEI8KG3XS","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hard to write a lot about an anti-fatigue mat, but I will give you my observations.APPEARANCE:This mat is a neutral dark brown with a bit of grey in it.  As I have warm beige tiles with a brownish orange tinge in my kitchen and medium oak cabinets it was a good fit.  At work, since it is behind my desk, its color is neutral enough to be not noticed. The finish on top is matt, so there is no shine, but can be easily wiped clean.DIMENSIONS:Mat measures 20 x 30 with a 2 chamfer all around where it blends flatter to the floor.  Thickness in the middle is about .  If you roll a chair into it, it will stop and not creep onto the mat. So if you change between standing and sitting you will need to move the mat. The mat when shipped is not rolled or folded and most likely you dont want to roll or fold it to risk flattening it.USAGE: HOME & WORKHOMEIve used this mat both at home in front of the sink and at work behind my standing desk. I found at home, that it was comfortable but I didnt stand long enough behind the sink (dishwasher makes that possible) to make it of much use there.  Food preparation also happened at various other spots on the counter, such that it would have to be moved around to suit.  You will catch your foot slightly on this mat (very slightly) so you need to know where it is.  Moving it around is makes that hard to predict.  If you are a person who stands in the kitchen, in one spot more than I do, this might work better for you than it did for me.  Another alternative might be at a work bench for a hobbyist. Since that is not me, I cant speak to that.  In my case, work seemed a better fit.WORKIve noted at my standing desk that various shoes had degrees of comfort if standing all day. So this mat really takes the place of a pair of shoes that have great support.  (think high quality running shoes on steroids).  After a few moments usage, I have noted the different of standing on the mat, to walking on the floor.  Suddenly the floor seems harder.  Similar to the home usage, a chair will catch on it, so when I switch from standing to sitting the mat will need to be moved.but, here I feel is where its real benefit is for me and the movement is slight and not likely to be tripped on.  Im more motivated to use it as it works and it will not be difficult to move it.  Still not sure what our office cleaning staff will think of it.Another note, unlike a nice cushioned shoe, the thickness of the mat is constant and your weight on your foot is not.  Much of my weight is on my heels so I felt they were sinking in more, and you feel a slight back tilt. My running shoes has more padding in the heel to accommodate that and you experience less tilt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSS13VNWAVXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PQXK68#wasThisHelpful","R3GSS13VNWAVXP","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderfully written book that chronicles the authors early years and vet school.  Jessica is an introvert that discovered quickly her relationship with dogs was more rewarding than with humans.  She has several dogs growing up and her early years as a vet and young mother that provide her companionship and love that only a pet can.Working as a vet can be challenging and rewarding.  This book covers a bit of both.  She also tells the story of a dear friend of her husbands, whose personality reminded her of a friendly dog (in a good way).As you can imagine since she mentions 3 dogs that she also deals with their passing.  This is done in an understanding way. Its sad, but it also the price you pay for loving a pet.  Having had pets all my live (mostly cats but 2 dogs), the joy is worth the pain and she observes this as well.Thoroughly well written and enjoyable book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JIY1GVU7JZ2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554936#wasThisHelpful","R1JIY1GVU7JZ2M","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pair of Samba 2 dress shoes was my 2nd set.  The first was a size 11, I had purchased, as I own another pair of this brand (Taos Jive pump) in the size 11.  When I received the size 11 in these, they were way too big.  I had a finger sized gap in my heel.Since I wear a perfect 10-1/2 which no one makes, I would say this particular shoe runs a bit large and I'm okay with that.  Would be nice if the two shoes were consistent, but returning the too large pair only cost me time (thankfully I purchased these in plenty of time).I purchased these for my son's wedding.  I have to wear a low heel due to bad knees and these were perfect.  I also liked the cut out top.Especially nice was the velcro-closure.  If you have ever struggled to put shoes on that have a hole and pin, this was a breeze in comparison.A silver looking shoe is quite dressy.  However, as much as I liked these shoes they did not seem as dressy as I would like.  Maybe it was the beige interior in combination with the silver exterior.  No one saw that but me however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N691CSFOB13O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPMM85A#wasThisHelpful","R3N691CSFOB13O","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caroline Jacobs is a mouse, a mouse that suddenly roared with no warning and then no explanation.  Caroline is the ultimate introvert, that manipulative people know how to tie in knots.  Even her teenage daughter walks over her.Finally one day she has had enough and embarks on a mission to right some wrongs. Deciding she needs a partner in crime, she basically kidnaps her daughter to accompany her.  Along the way they discover who each other is.The author captures the trap of the introverted.  Their best replies go unsaid and planned speaks can get diverted easily.  Often, so used to tamping back their feelings of how people have treated them, they bully themselves they are over-reacting. Bravo in catching this accurately.I started reading this story and finished it the same day. It positively flowed and you cared what was going to happen next.  Funny that one I read just before this (Night Blindness) also dealt with guilt over the death of a sibling.  It seems when tragedy happens, guilt and blame even in accidents play a large part in the families of the deceased. It is rare that it is resolved.This book was wonderful as it flowed.  It was unpredictable and very predictable in the right measures.  The characters were well developed and unique.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLIYP5SDHHSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250006309#wasThisHelpful","RPLIYP5SDHHSF","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started this book, I felt the main character hopping back and forth between the present and the past a bit annoying and hard to follow.. The info on this book indicated there was a deep dark secret and it was clear the main character (Jensen/Jenny) was obsessed with this issue. However, as the book continued, I felt the author smoothed this out.The main character Jensen, is married to Nico, her former art teacher. He is older and clearly controlling her life.  She models nude for sculptors.  Just once give me a girl next door character, without being gorgeous and nearly being anorexic.  Of course these men are all in love with her, she is aloof with them and a knockout.  Later, they reveal her feelings of inferiority over her looks, but it was more of an after-thought. Okay off my soapbox on that one.The characters are well developed and I think they capture the fracturing of a family over the loss of a child.  Grief isnt even.  The irony does not escape me that Jensen does not see the parallel between her own reaction and her mothers.Many of the characters are pretty iconic, the big bear of a Dad, the ice maiden Mom, the counterculture Uncle and his psychic girlfriend, the bad girl best friend, the one who got away because of this awful secret and the sibling that died too young.  BUT, it is a good book to read.  I never set it down due to boredom or lack of interest and I doubt you will either. It has an interesting story and captures the aspect of being different selves with different people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXDVSIJ37AAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042836#wasThisHelpful","R2EXDVSIJ37AAT","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we received this rack in the mail, the first thing that impressed us was the sheer weight. It is clear the items are of durable quality just by that metric. After unwrapping assembling and using this assessment became even stronger.  Several friends have commented on its appearance.INSTRUCTIONS AND ASSEMBLY:This was very nicely done.All the parts were well labeled and nicely wrapped to protect all the surfaces.  Stickers were on each part so you know what parts went where.  All the hardware was in a bag.Not only did they show you in wonderful illustrations how things got put together they recommended the orientation of the parts.  Sometimes you installed with the rack in different orientations and they were clear to note when this was to happen.  They also told you when not to tighten up stuff completely, so it had some play while other things were still being attached.Also and these means a lot,  they included extra hardware.  This is a godsend if a part goes ricocheting off somewhere never to be found. I recently put together a very expensive tool that didnt have a single spare and we lost 30 minutes trying to find a nut we dropped.The assembly went smoothly and we carted this very solid rack up 8 stairs and I can vouch for fact, the weight was in the rack not the packing.USAGE:The beautiful wood on the top, base and small shelves is a nice match to my medium oak dining room.  The darkened silver uprights, glass and bottle racks are a wonderful accent.  Not too flashy or tacky.  All 28 bottles that I have put in it, have a  nice tilt and the glasses slide in their holder.  Of course the glasse have some play and are not secured.  Might take them out when the grandchildren come over, but other than that, Im content with their fit.  Any tighter might cause different issues.  I have grasped the rack and shook it to see if there was any play and it was limited only to making my glasses ring.  Very little movement was noted.  Since I have the unit on carpeting that is most likely where the play came from.The dimensions are nice fit in my house. 16.5 tall X 38 wide X 41.5 tall.  Only you will know what works for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UKMX18XD6NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVSRHKK#wasThisHelpful","R38UKMX18XD6NJ","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a primer for leaping without a net, but more the authors exploration of her own experience and talking to others who have done the same thing.This book talks about the psychology of what our job means to us and her personal journey of what quitting meant to her.To be honest, I found the first half very repetitive.  Okay, you are not THE Tess Vigeland of Marketplace anymore.  I get that.  So whats next?Later in the book she talks a bit more about what is next, working from home, the money aspects, if you have kids etc. But, these seem very lightly touched. There are other peoples stories in this book, but it didnt flow, quite the way I would have expected someone who spoke for a living.Having never heard Tess Vigeland on radio, I didnt come to this book to read about someone I knew, but more the job change aspect.  I think we all think at sometimes we would like a change and I was hoping for some guidance.  I can empathize with some of her comments about loss of identity years back when I gave up a job I loved due to changes in the office and a dynamic, I could not tolerate, but in my case I moved into another job, so it was not that dramatic.However, if you, like me came to this book expecting a bit more guidance or recommendations, I really didnt find that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TUTL54QPPJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140758#wasThisHelpful","R16TUTL54QPPJS","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book caught my eye for two reasons, the author is an ex-pat in Japan, a country I have found interesting and have traveled to a number of times, as well as the aspect of relating issues to yoga.  As I practice yoga, I thought this would be an interesting mix.  I dont think of yoga associated with Japan, though you see Tai Chi in many parks in the AM, so I was wondering how this went together.This book is the story of a young Jewish woman meeting a Japanese man while living in Japan, falling in love and traversing several countries.  They marry and try to start a family to no avail.  Knowing how strict Japan, is regarding race & family, I was curious to see how an adoption of a Japanese child to an older mixed race couple panned out.  In this book you can see the authors struggles, not only with the institution of adoption, but relinquishing the option of a child of her own.  It is a struggle I have seen some friends and family go through. I think she captures the emotional side of it well.The book is wonderfully well written. Even if you dont have an interest in yoga, or have issues with fertility, this book is an interesting read of the authors life.  I had a hard time putting it down and finished it in 2-3 days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STWDTJ1GQGWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611720214#wasThisHelpful","R2STWDTJ1GQGWL","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this story is a young woman is raped in college and walks the PCT to sort things out.  In a nutshell this is what it is about.THE PCT ITSELF:The descriptions of the PCT are great to read and you get a good sense of the harshness of the journey and the appreciation of trail angels.  Hypothermia, malnutrition, dehydration and infections as well as outright injuries or death are a very real part of this journey as well.  You also get a sense of the beauty and pride as well as the sheer athleticism of this walk.  30 miles a day, is as the author called a marathon a day.GREAT WRITINGFirst of all the writing is great, she clearly knows how to tell a story.  I found the latter third of the book however spent more time describing the scenery than the earlier sections.  Maybe at that point she was being more aware of her surroundings, than the people and her own internal struggle. It seemed a real shift in the writing.SOME ISSUES:But, I struggle with some of the inconsistencies represented in this story..Her rape was a complicated thing.  Not a violent assault, but a confusing jumble of being the victim of an overly assertive guy in a compromising situation.  Still rape, but fell within a very grey area, that often finds in favor of the rapist. That was unfortunate.  But, the counselors at the college and her parents reaction was abominable.  Clearly there was an issue and it was not dealt with even remotely correctly.  You sense the damage to her self esteem and it only got worse with the number of people that downplayed it.One issue I had was her characterizations of her parents.  A woman that dresses her teenage daughter through high school, I find it hard to believe could not be unawares of her daughter lying about walking a portion of the PCT during a summer holiday (prior to this walk).  That to me is inconsistent.  Her parents were highly educated professional people.  This level of control (dressing) seems inconsistent with being blithely unaware of where your daughter is for an entire summer.  Then the mothers reaction in the doctors office versus dealing with the college over her rape makes no sense, unless the lawyer in her wrote off the situation as unwin-nable.  Were they so older parents that, they alternatively were overbearing and dismissive.  Seems off the mark.The author herselfs choice of walking the PCT after a rape where she is an extreme minority is peculiar.  She said she didnt think it out but maybe this was her way of healing (baptism by fire).  I guess.  Her actions on the trail; Going naked in the pool, giving herself the name Wild Child has all sorts of connotations and even the prior on-line relationship with the other PCT hiker hopeful all speak to someone testing sexual waters..  Sometimes the water gets  too hot.  I get that she might have been a bit messed up, but it does raise a red flag. Her testing of IceCap seemed borderline on controlling him as well.  Hmm, the nut does not fall too far from the tree here.As far as compassion, she had very little.  What stood out was getting her then boyfriend IceCap to ditch the annoying other hiker when he was most leary of an area.  That kind of casual disregard for another is how people get killed in these situations. Then, she alternately resented her Moms control, yet relied on it.  One minute worrying that her Mom was up all night and then casually forgetting to contact her.  I dont know too many 19 year olds that refer to their Mom as Mommy. That was jarring.  Additionally she seemed to be still fighting very old fights in her head regarding her own independence and did go on about that ad-nauseum. The book is a coming to terms, but highly repetitive.In the  latter part of the book she calls herself out on her relationship with her Mom and it would seem she and her Dad patched things up as well.  Maybe reading her own book over and over provided some sort of judgement on her part for her lack of maturity.Overall, she is a good writer, the PCT is one heck of a walk.  The book was an interesting story, that included a sometimes not easy to like prime character.  If you like to hear stories of the PCT and hiking you might enjoy this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HBX9GVTOS2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R16HBX9GVTOS2W","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book could have been all sorts of facts and figures on how memories are made and recalled, but instead the author took a much more interesting tactic and used personal anecdotes and case histories to bring the personal aspect of memories into play.We all know (at least all of those old enough to read this book), that elusive memory that plagues us.  Or that one we are sure of that, despite facts to the contrary, we insist is true.  Why does this happen?  Why are only certain events recalled from our childhood?  Why are some emotional events dead on, and others shaky?  The author covers this and many other cases (from PTSD to amnesia) in a very readable and interesting way. The chapters are below:Casting a Line: Intro, while trying to remember a specific event.Getting Lost: Remembering gone wrong.  Finding inaccuracies in what you remember.The Scent Museum: The role of scent in triggering memories.The Sunny Never-Never: Events, we have forgotten versus those remememberedWalking at Goldhanger: Memories of conversationsNegotiating the Past: Memory seeding.  Telling others about a person/event and their memoryThe Plan of What Might Be: Architecture of memory and some memory enhancing processes.The Feeling of Remembering: Deja-vu is a chemical processRemember Me a Story: Remembering changes your memoryThe Horror Returning: PTSDThe Martha Tapes: Recollections of a Grandmother how we tend to recall ages from teens to 30s.Special Kind of Truth: SummaryThis  really is an amazing book.  It gets you thinking about what you recall and when and how detailed these memories are. The authors stories help you realize, that you have been there as well.  I especially like that he re-enacted several memories of his own and found them wanting in familiarity in one case and in facts in another.  That kind of twist can leave you wondering.  Its nice to that it is a fairly universal phenomena.

"This story has an  interesting delivery.  You are reading a young mans story of an adored adopted uncle, while also reading the book penned by that uncle Poxl West..  As you can imagine any story about WWII has the protagonist a hero of his people and this book was no exception.The book is well written and the shift from one voice to the other is well done.  Its a very introspective book.  The uncle often casted people he know as characters from Shakespeare, so if you know Shakespeare (I dont), you have a sense of how he felt about them and their role in his life. You can understand some of his choices, from his youth, even though they mystify himself years later, context is everything and that serves to remind ourselves of this aspect. This I thought was very well done.The young man, is a very typical young man with an overly busy father whos uncle spent a lot of time with him.  The uncle to him was larger than life adored and provided an outlet for his attention.  I found the other important figure in this young mans life, his rabbi an interesting mix of contradictions.  Essentially a hippy rabbi, who was into the Kabbalah and worships the Grateful Dead.  He provided some interesting commentary, in contrast to the young mans concerns.This book makes you think about biographies.  How people reconstruct scenes years later, to give you a fresh sense that they just happened and the liberties around this truth.Overall it was an interesting book, well written, easy to read and an thoughtful premise.  You dont get a clear resolution, or completion however and that is just what life is like.  A minor complaint, is I thought some avenues were left a bit vague and wondered why they were introduced, but maybe I just missed the point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGCORWI4B334/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250051681#wasThisHelpful","R3UGCORWI4B334","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I opted to get this razor for my boyfriend who uses a 4-5 blade standard razor every AM.  He said prior electrics didnt work well for him, but this one being top of the line was worth a shot.PACKAGING:First of all I was surprised when this razor came.  It was frustration free packaging and I wasnt quite sure what that was.  It meant there was no extra retail box inside the packing one.  Less waste.  That is a good thing.  There is a base, the razor and the triple head as well as a separate head for trims and a carry case for travel.SIZE:While the razor was a fairly common size, it was housed in a base that takes up considerable counter space about 5 x 5 inches and about 10 inches tall. If your counter space in the bathroom is as precious as ours, this is too big.  Im sure you can plug it in elsewhere or only occasionally as I dont think daily (or maybe even weekly) charging is necessary, but thats a lot of bother. This base provides charging and cleaning.  A few times, I think it went through a cleaning cycle in the middle of the night which was a bit weird.QUALITY OF SHAVE:Well, this is what its all about isnt it?  It did not meet my boyfriends expectations. He was hoping for an ease of shave, which he did not find.  He tried it dry and with electric shave lotion.  Still he felt there was too much drag on his face.  He was looking for a closeness of shave, if not as close as a blade, at least a reasonable substitute.  However he remained disappointed.  To be fair, he used the blade about 3 weeks before returning to his normal method of shaving using a 4 or 5 blade standard razor.  He did not feel this was a reasonable substitute in a pinch.How does this compare to other electrics, we can't answer, so please take that in account.  That's why we gave it a 3 and not a 2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6064MVTCLA6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","R6064MVTCLA6Z","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having a food processor before this I had certain expectations.  My prior one is a Kitchenaide and it sits on my counter ready for use with the large bowl set up, as it is integral to some of my recipes.  I use it for a chicken recipe to grind up the chicken, to grate cheese, to slice vegetables and fruits and to chop nuts.  So this unit has to meet that high bar.The short version, ""whys"" are below:OVERALL RATING:Height: Negative. Wont fit under counter with bowl attached.Weight: Neutral: Heavy, would not be an issue unless had to movePower cord: PositiveSmall bowl needing big one to use: Neutral since common with other food processorsCover fit: Neutral.  I dont like it as much as what Im used to, but others may have no issueSettings: Positive, More is better.Accessory box: Positive, Nice.Rotating blades: Positive, heavy and adjustableDouble food pusher: Positive, can accommodate larger foodsUsage: Neutral, Comparable to the KitchenaidePositives:  5Negatives: 1Neutrals: 4The neutrals you need to decide for yourself if this is an issue.DOESNT FIT UNDER MY CABINETS ON THE COUNTERWhat I first noticed about the Cuisinart is that it will not fit under my cabinets on my counter.  It measures 17 inches tall with the large bowl in place.  My cabinets are 16 inches from my counter.  My old Kitchenaide measures 15 inches tall.  This is a problem for me as I would have to have it on the counter without the bowl attached.  Certainly I would not want to pull the Cuisinart every time I used it.  It is quite heavy.  Its listed shipping weight it 27.5 pounds, so at least 22-23 pounds of that is the unit itself.WIND UP POWER CORD:This unit has a nice wind up cord.  You pull it to recoil.  This is a nice option, if you like me unplug and wrap it around the unit when not used.TO  USE SMALL BOWL, YOU MUST ALSO USE THE LARGE BOWL:Similar to the Kitchenaide the top cover is for both the small bowl and large bowl and you must use the large bowl with the small, so that this fits all together.  I never liked that.  Often I will use my smaller food processor to not have so many things to wash.COVER FIT:I have been used to the Kitchenaide so this is a bias and might not affect a first time user.  The bottom bowl twists in, the top bowl sets in and the cover has to snap on one side and the back, rather than twist on.  I find this really fussy and would be concerned that any side spill could make this tricky.  I havent found this happening, but there is something fussy about this.SETTINGS: ON, OFF, PULSE AND DOUGH:Having never done dough in my prior food processor, Im not sure how handy this will be for me, but, more is better right?  My prior Kichenaide does not have this.ACCESSORY BOX:I like this, as there is a drawer under the box, that stores the rotating blades. This is nice.ROTATING BLADES:There is a less and more here. The shredding blade is a single one, one thicker that flips to one thinner. But notable is an adjustable Madoline style blade.  You have 22 adjustments from 1-10. This is pretty cool.  I noted that these blades are a lot heavier than my Kitchenaide ones.  The cutting blades are a small one for the smaller bowl, a large one and a dough one.  Overall these blades seem more durable than my Kitchenaide.DOUBLE FOOD PUSHER:This is a positive.  The cover has a food pusher inside a food pusher.  The big one is integrated (for safety no doubt), so you cant run the processor with this not in the cover, the smaller is not, so you can drop food in this one.  What I like about this is you can put whole potatoes in this and not have to cut to fit.USAGE:This being summer, I have not used it as much as I will in the winter, so I will update.  It is comparable to the Kitchenaide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLD8UJZSXQZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLX6M5M#wasThisHelpful","RQLD8UJZSXQZR","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high expectations that were not met.  I had been familiar with a pillowcase offered that the same group that sells the Sleepnumber bed and knew of another pillow a friend had purchased.  So when I saw this I jumped at it.I could feel the cooling surface side of the pillow felt cool to the touch with my hand so I was excited.  However except for initially feeling cool, the pillow was no cooler than my newer Somus pillow that I have used for the last year.  I slept on this new pillow for about a month.I tried this with a cotton pillowcase and even without a pillowcase and still it was not any cooler than the Somus or for that matter any other pillow.Comfort-wise it was okay as well.  My Somus pillow is a little bit thicker and as I have a jaw and neck issue this is preferred.Im going to let my boyfriend try this one for a bit to see what he thinks, but this is just so-so for meIn the past I have often found my buckwheat pillow to be a bit cooler than most.  Maybe I will try that out again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NS2JYGS9KZLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPA3NKU#wasThisHelpful","R3NS2JYGS9KZLV","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found the premise of this book compelling.  3 sisters essentially failing at life compelled to make a pact for suicide when one of the 3 has intractable cancer.  The word in the description of this book used was ""hilarious"".  I could use some comedy.  Alas for my purposes none was found here.Had I not been reading this book for review as part of the Vine program, I would have put it down and walked away. Nothing is hilarious about a bunch of misfit woman feeling they need to make reparations for a grandfather who was responsible for the means to annihilate the Jews during WWII.  There is a long story here, the why, the when and in about 1/4 of this book you get the full background story.  In fact you get most of the stories of the family suicides.  Do you see my point where ""Hysterical"" does not cut it.All 3 woman are introverts and have issues with interacting with people.  One is good with puns and can remember her father enjoyed them as well. No one knows where he ended up.  There are a few inspired sections about word usage specifically ""then"" capturing the elusive nature of before and after in our world but for the most part it is a sad, sorry slog about people you just don't get.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG64M32ZXWK7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062355880#wasThisHelpful","RG64M32ZXWK7V","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book does remind me of Maeve Binchys books in the way that you are made familiar with the inner workings of several characters and then they are all slowly brought into the mix of a greater story.  However this author has their own unique voice.I chuckled when I started to read however, not too many books start with a mammogram.As with some mammograms, Iris wound up with the doctor asking her to come in for subsequent tests.  That worried her.  Add to that losing her job and suddenly Iris day was not looking too stellar.  Being a fairly recent widow, having lost her husband to cancer two years prior, suddenly her future and her mortality was looking her in the face.  This prompted Iris to remember her promise to her husband, that she had stuffed in the back of her mind, unacted upon.  Luke was concerned that if anything happened to Iris, since he would be gone, their daughter Rose would be all alone in the world.  As Rose was adopted, her birth-mother was considered a form of insurance, in that instance, she might be someone for Rose to rely on in the unfortunate situation she ended up alone. Luke made Iris promise on his deathbed to find her.As we all do, when faced with crises, we overreact and Iris was not immune to that.  She immediately started a search for her daughters birth-mother and was ready to race to the end of the earth to find her and this is the story of how that went.Rose in the mean time, unaware of her mothers panic was having a crisis of her own.  Faced with a daunting masters program solo, she deliberately did not tell her mother of the date, so she would not add to her worry.  She regretted this, as she needed her reassurance, but then events unfolded that set her on a tailspin of her own.I like the way the book ended, not all wrapped up and tidy, but with pleasant possibilities at hand.  A great summer read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V9YQWSF4IZBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250054214#wasThisHelpful","R1V9YQWSF4IZBF","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having had a holster for prior phones (Samsung S4 and HTC Incredible), Im kind of hooked on holsters.  Part of the reason I like them so much is during work, I always have a belt and a jacket on, so my phone is easy to store and essentially invisible.  When Im not at work minus the jacket and belt, the holster clips on a pocket in my purse.  I can also toss it in a fanny pack, and the screen is well protected.  That being said how did this holster do for the LG G4?  Pretty darn good.PHONE FIT IN CASE:Ease of putting phone in case: Great.  However this is a tight fit and you dont want to have to get it out in a hurry.  My prior cases were like this and I never had an issue with that unless I had to change the battery or pull a card.  Ideally this is infrequent, so I was okay with the tight fit.  The phone will NEVER fall out of this case.CASE USE WITH HOLSTER:Thankfully both case and holster are made of hard plastic (had a prior one that was rubberized...bad idea).  The phone is initially harder to pull out and push in on first usage and it gets easier over time.  I suspect there are two reasons. One the case settles in around the phone, and the holster stretches.  The other is  you learn where to grab it.CASE STAND FOR READING:A prior case I purchased would not hold up the phone to read in any orientation. This does fine in both vertical and horizontal. Mind you, if you poke the screen to page through an e-book in a vertical orientation, you might knock over the phone.  But, this is minor...at least it stays up unpoked.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:I have a dock at home that I cannot use due to this case.  However I think that might be true due to any case, as the curve of the phone forces the shape of the case.  Also, unlike the HTC and Samsung, this phone does not have side buttons, so this case will be nice and strong on the sides.  A prior one had cutouts on the side and a drop took out a chunk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEIJVLR4J50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCHNOKU#wasThisHelpful","R2XEIJVLR4J50","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The short version of pros and cons:POSITIVES::**** Thin and light**** Beautiful display (1376 x 768)**** Big hard drive (1TB)**** 8 GB RAM**** Battery life (supposed)  - I havent had it off power enough to know .**** Numeric keypad: Some computers this size dont have them.  Keys are smaller.**** Much speedier than a 5 year old HP, it can handle also handle tough tasks like opening multiple tabs in Firefox at once better than the HP.**** Bluetooth works nicely, I sent a photo from my phone to the laptop in approx 10 seconds.  Pairing was painless.**** Connecting a wireless mouse took a bit longer than I expected, but when it did, it added all the extra controls.  I think the delay was due to a network issue we were having not the computer.NEGATIVES:**** Feels cheap. The surface flexes when pressed on, the 5 year old HP is solid, and my work Dell even more so.  The keypad feels cheap when compared to the HP too.  Less material equals lighter weight though. You get a hollow click when you use the mouse buttons.**** Sharp edges on the outside bottom edge where your arm lays, if you are touch typer.**** Hard drive speed - only 5400 rpm, 7200 would have been nice.**** Mouse pad is not as responsive as the 5  year old HP is to a touch.  Taps go ignored at times.  It might also be a learned thing too.Other:**** Ive had problems unmuting my speakers when in Firefox, Ive found exiting FF, unmuting, then relaunching FF to work.  I dont know whats at fault - Firefox, Windows 8, the laptop, or a combination of the 3.FAST, LIGHT AND EASY TO USE:Like the average computer user, Im not an expert in laptop speeds whatever.  But, I do know what I like in equipment.  Fast, light and easy to use.This laptop seems all that.  First of all, this is my first foray into Windows 8 and its a little confusing at first, but Im glad its the 8.1.  Ive used Windows 8 on my daughters Surface tablet and was exposed to this style GUI on a Windows phone as well.  So Im hoping Windows 8 will not influence this review.  I know the later Windows 8 made accommodations to Windows 7 users, so I should be okay.OUT OF THE BOX AND SETUP:The lightness of this laptop struck me out of the box and put next to another computer (a ~5 year older HP) it is  the thickness of the older computer.  Looking at the finish it is a flat brushed black, and that also makes it look unique.The textured area around the keyboard gives it a pleasant feel, compared to the shiny ones that most laptops have.  Sometimes in warm weather my bare arms would stick on other laptop surfaces. The only negative there is the edges around the outside edge of the laptop felt a bit sharp.  Imagine sitting at a table and if you are like me, your wrists scrape across this area a lot when type (touch-typing, not hen-pecking).Start up and set up were smooth and quick. Each new computer I get does this faster and easier.  One thing that struck me odd, was that this was the first computer that did not stress creating recovery disks during setup.  Mind you, it is in the quick start guide step 3. Does anyone but me read those though? Mind you, since Windows XP, I dont think I have used my recovery disks on any computer.  We keep our virus checkers up to date and todays computers are a lot more stable.One of Toshibas advantages is that this computer does not have a whole bunch of added software.  Years ago that might have been a disadvantage, but now, many of us have our email online and our applications as well.USAGE:So far, after more than a few weeks of shared usage (my boyfriend and me), we have combined notes and feel this is a pretty good deal.  He likes Firefox and I like Chrome.  Both work well.  I like a separate mouse at times and he always uses the touch pad.  Both work okay.  He indicated the touch pad sometimes was not as responsive as he liked, but this might be a carryover from his laptop.  Time could change that.  I will update if it doesnt.The one thing I didnt like was Microsoft related.  Windows 8 has all these handy things on the start screen: Mail, Calendar, etc. and to really use any of those effectively you need to use a Microsoft account.  Mind you, this can be set up with a non-Microsoft address, but it is not so easy to figure out.  Since my primary email is Yahoo and Roadrunner and my calendar and shared documents are Google, this gets complicated really fast.  I like the way my Android phone does this a whole lot better.Some spec comparisons between this and a Dell Inspiron 15-5000 at a similar priceTOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240**** 5th Generation Intel Core i5-5200U 2.2 GHz ProcessorDELL INSPIRON 15-5000**** 5th Generation Intel Core i5-5200U ProcessorTOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240**** 8 GB DIMM RAMDELL INSPIRON 15-5000**** 8GB 2 DIMM (2x4GB) DDR3L 1600MhzTOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240**** 1 TB 5400 rpm Hard DriveDELL INSPIRON 15-5000**** 1TB 5400 rpm SATA Hard DriveTOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240**** 15.6-Inch Screen; (1366 x 768)DELL INSPIRON 15-5000**** 15.6 inch LED Backlit Display (1376 x 768)TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240**** Size: 10.20 x 14.96 x 0.93 inches; Weight: 4.8 lbsDELL INSPIRON 15-5000**** Size: 10.0 x 14.9 x 0.9 inches: Weight 5.24 lbsTOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240**** (2)USB 3.0 and (1)USB 2.0**** (1) SD card slot**** (1)HDMI output**** (1)Ethernet**** (1)high-speed Wireless-N connectivity**** (1)with BluetoothDELL INSPIRON 15-5000**** (2)USB 3.0 and (1)USB 2.0**** (1)Media Card (SD, SDHC, SD3.0, MS, MS Pro)**** (1)HDMI 1.4a**** (1)10/100 RJ-45 Ethernet network**** Security slot","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R384UP2A1N6KOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFY8LY2#wasThisHelpful","R384UP2A1N6KOX","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had an older table saw with a much smaller blade so this table saw with its bigger blade and easy storage capability had a certain amount of appeal. Having seen a Delta saw in the store with much smaller wheels, Im glad this one had the larger ones.  Much easier to move around on an uneven surface..ASSEMBLY OF FOLDABLE FRAME: PAINFULAssembling this portable saw, had you only to put together the frame that made it portable and the guards, but the process was made painful by muddy black and white pictures in the manual.The parts were all nicely labeled, but except for accounting for having them all, no attempt was made to use this labeling when it came to put the items together.  I had to look up what they called them in the spot where you accounted for them to figure this out.Also the close ups of the assembly, were so close you could not see the parts that were supposed to be assembled.  Also, at one time during assembly, we dropped a nut and panicked, because if we did not find it, we would have to stop assembly.  Im used to equipment coming with some spare parts, this one did not.  It think a few extra nuts would be appreciated.  It took a while to figure out how to fully assemble the anti-kick piece, initially.  The instructions were not handy in this regard at all.  The pictures on the box and the description in the book dont jive.IMPRESSIONS: VERSATILE AND HAS NICE STORAGEThis saw appears to have everything you could want in a table saw.  It is also clearly made to move around.  I found it quite easy to move it from a storage position to an upright and usable position and back again. (Im a woman in her late 50s)**** It tilts up to 45 degrees.**** It has two slots for its included miter gauge which is fairly common.  I liked that the miter gauge clicked in at every 15 degrees. There is a spot to store it under the left of the saw table.**** Blade raises nearly 5 inches we did not feel it was tall enough for a 4 x 4 piece of lumber though.**** Comes with a fence, like most table saws that fits nicely in place and has storage, though if you dont position it well, it will fall out. Fence can slide out the length of the right extension making the useful table size much wider.**** The wood pusher stick provided slid on its locking tabs under the table.**** The blade wrenches had a spot as well.**** There was a spot to wrap the cord with room for a longer extension cord.**** There were two table extensions: One on the rear for to support long workpieces and another on the right side to essentially make the table bigger and accommodate larger pieces of wood. The fence can attach to this.The manual makes a point of indicating that you can do the following and shows how to approach it.  This part of the manual is okay, as it uses illustrations  It even shows how to do a Dado cut by using stacked blades, but needs a special throat plate.  However the standard ones that can be done with this saw are:**** Crosscuts**** Rip cuts**** Mitered Crosscuts**** Beveled Crosscuts**** Beveled Ripcuts**** Compound Miter cutsPROJECTS:At this time we only had one project to do, so only used it to do simple lumber cuts, essentially all crosscuts. The table extension helped on the long lumber and the fence was nice to push the wood along.  We used a clamp we had to help secure the straightness.  We have not done any angled cuts yet or any ripping, but this saw seems to have the goods.  Wish I had it a few years ago, when I made a table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DRB8834FPTT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7UHBAY#wasThisHelpful","R3DRB8834FPTT2","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all the book description and what I read did not jive as much as I prefer.  My expectations were much different. A full 2/3rds of the book had me waiting for detailed talk of cooking, recipes or ingredients.  While there was some discussion of this as part of the story, it was more hidden in context of the story.  For instance the chapter called Chocolate Habaneros was more about the child Eva growing them hydroponically in her closet and then  using them as the ultimate weapon against some bullies.The main character Eva, is followed throughout the book but is not always who the story is about.  She is often described by the main character, the chapter is about.  In fact in one chapter, she is a distant judge in a competition. In some cases you have prior knowledge of the character the story is centered on, but in others they are minor characters that you really never see until much later.  The character development is interesting and sad in some cases and you see how many people can influence another persons life.Ultimately this was not the book I expected.  A fan of food-based or recipe-centered books, I expected more content about what the character was enthusiastic about.  Having read Ruth Reichls recent novel: Delicious, this was more my expectation.Stepping aside from expectations and considering the book on its own merits as a coming-of-age book about a young womans life, it too was lacking.  She was on the periphery of too many of the chapters.  You see her motivations as a young child, but she is portrayed as this magical fairy sort of person that has had a rough life.  You never really see the growth of the Eva character.  Its all about the food, in many technical artsy ways.  Many of the other characters are developed full, you see their inside story from Jordy to Pat.  In fact in each chapter, these characters form a short story of their own and there is some food aspect to each, but it is not Evas story.It was an interesting read but the description of the book should be redone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKTA0V87ZGTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052542914X#wasThisHelpful","REKTA0V87ZGTQ","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this book is that several people are having a hard time with their life and see an ad for a cottage in Maine that sounds enchanting.  It is an opportunity to get away from it all for a month in August.  The 4 of them decide they need it.  However this cottage has the reputation for being what people need to get their life back on track.  Rarely do people come back, as they find resolution.  Maybe this year it will include the owner.This years line-up is:**** Lottie, whos husbands job as an attorney in an aggressive firm seems to be drawing him further and further away from her and they are practically only roommates.**** Rose, whose fellow writer husband has achieved critical acclaim only for a book hes written under a pseudonym.  Her own career has been put on hold for his and their young children.  She is struggling with the children and her own lack of ability to get back into her writing.  In the meantime her husband is drifting into temptation.**** Catherine, once an A-list actress is living in shame due to a minor gaffe at an awards ceremony.  She feels all who see her, only see that.  A nice getaway may help recharge her batteries.**** Beverly, whos partner and beloved cat has passed, has let life and happiness drift by and is not dealing with financial responsibilities or duties as well as they should.**** Robert, the owner of the cottage, has hoped the cottage might work for him as well.  He is smitten with Rose when she rents the cottage and hopes something might kindle there.I found this story enchanting.  Everyone is so introspective of their own issues and sees those of others on the periphery, but are considerate in the process.  They all grow and discover the life on the island and start to redefine themselves in the process.  There are several undercurrents and twists and potential issues.Its a fun pleasant story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLBOSU2GX89Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525429050#wasThisHelpful","ROLBOSU2GX89Z","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I opted to get this faucet for several reasons.**** It incorporates the spray hose into the faucet, I wanted one of those**** It has two settings, one more typical faucet and one more typical spray hose.  Switch is on the spray head**** Design of this faucet is curvy and in keeping with the design of my hot water dispenser that I just replaced. If you have an ultra modern very angular kitchen design this may be too curvy for you.It was a bonus that this sink had a touch feature.  I was not quite sure what I thought of that, but I had an open mind.OUT OF THE BOX:Lots of parts but all well labeled.  Looked like a great installation booklet.  Came with a cover for a 3-holed faucet that we didnt need, but kept as we will need it for another faucet in another location.INSTALLATION:I had a friend who does this sort of stuff for a living install the faucet for me and my boyfriend, as my knees and his back were not up to it.  You see with putting in a new faucet we just had to have a new sink and since we had a hot water dispenser and a garbage disposal, dis-assembly was going to take a while.  It if was the faucet alone we could have done it.From the guy that put the faucet in, while we watched: Instructions were great, more pictures than words.  The illustrated pictures were clear and easy to understand.  This is in great contrast to another assembly situation we found ourselves in earlier this week, where black and white pictures were substituted.  Their pictures had too much in them and were too muddy to make out the detail of what to do.  These instructions were wonderful.The only negative comment, the installer had was that batteries for touch capability seem overlarge.  6 AA batteries in holder take up a lot of room in a tight space.  You would think an alternative could be smallerAlso the other potential point of confusion, though it was sort of spelled out in the manual, the wire (that looks like a ground wire) must be attached as shown in the diagram, no other way.  Our friend (who had never put this type of faucet in before) put it on another piece of tubing, assuming it was a ground wire and the faucet initially did not function properly.  When he was wondering what was wrong, I pored over the manual and said, I dont think that was a ground wire.  All works great now.We also due to a close windowsill did not install the faucet with the handle on the right. If we did that, it would be restricted in its movement.  Instead the handle is facing forward so the LCD is on the left.  The LCD shows what the water temp is.  If you have the touch feature working (by leaving the tap handle open), you need to know what to expect.USAGE:Leaving the faucet on, a tap on the neck or tap handle stops it.  Tapping again turns it on.  Touching the spray head does nothing so it works without interruption while spraying.  This evening, I cooked with raw meat and onions and when I schooled myself to touch the faucet, it was great.  Takes a bit to get used to.  You need to also leave the faucet open to the temperature you want.  An LCD light shows the anticipated temp.  Blue for cold, Red for hot.  Using the integrated spray will take more experience.  My old sprayer however was constantly sticking and had to be pushed back into the sink, so the bar to meet is not too high there.  One thing I had been concerned about, was would the spray handle reach the Keurig tank next to the sink as it has to go sideways and up...It does.INITIAL OVERALL OPINION OF THIS FAUCET:I really like it and found the touch feature is something I use a lot more that I would have expected.  The only negative with the touch feature is when you are cleaning the sink.  I found I kept touching the faucet as I was cleaning the back of sink, so the water was going on and off.So far the cats have not figured it out, so I leave it on a lot.I will update this review as I do more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4AKKXGXCHF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRJALYI#wasThisHelpful","R1J4AKKXGXCHF9","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book starts out well and then devolves into advice after advice after advice.The author is a good writer and the book seems well organized, but after a while it seemed like I was plodding through it, going from one story to another.  The author sprinkles the story with a bit of her own history, which livens it up a bit, but after a while it is all so repetitive.While Im not personally anticipating a wedding my son is and I thought this book would give him and his fiance some good advice, but by 2/3s of the way through, it was not something I think they would find interesting.There are several sections in this book:**** Dating**** Commitment**** Breakups**** Weddings**** Making it lastIN BREAKUPSOne thing I found appalling was advice for the brokenhearted and suggesting a rebound relationship.  This does not consider they would be potentially wounding another person and seemed horribly self-serving.IN WEDDINGSOver and over I keep hearing make it  your way, you need to put your stamp on things, but gives only extreme cases such as a goth wedding.  Nothing as simple as the bride choosing the best man and the groom the maid of honor.  Or a cheesecake wedding cake. Sometimes people are at a loss as the subtle level of personalizing.MAKING IT LAST:This section impressed me the most.  She makes a good point about not romanticizing the WWII era relationships when we hear of them happily reaching 60 years.  There are a lot more relationships that didnt.  Divorce-stigma and women not being self supporting played a big part in that and many people in abusive relationships stayed but not because they wanted to.  The bottom line is to dont have such high expectations for marriage.  There will be rough times and it is how you work through that, that defines you more.Overall it was a good book, but, not unique or organized enough to give it a high rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HV81PFZOYSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549694#wasThisHelpful","R14HV81PFZOYSW","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Owning a multitude of digital cameras (I mean a real lot) and having a video cam and a sport cam that can go underwater, this is my first action cam made to capture live motion.  I was not sure what made it unique, now I know The remote and the app as well as the size of the camera.SUMMARY:PRO:**** Camera is small due to the lack of live display that can be on the remote or cell phone based**** Smooth recording and playback**** Great sound**** Nice available SW for video manipulation**** Camera shape may make this more secure for a head mounted display than a more traditional camera shape.CON:**** Shape of camera is longitudinal, so cant be flat against a persons chest.FUNCTIONAL EQUIPMENTWell for one thing it is smaller than a deck of cards a bit bigger than  a deck actually.  It comes in a plastic case that still enables you to press the buttons (as there are only 3 buttons and a switch, thats easy).  The case is a snug fit that makes it water-proof to 10 feet. It has a rechargeable separate battery that charges using a USB. Looks like a standard B USB end.The camera uses a micro-SDHC and comes with a 64MB card.This camera has 8 selections in the menu: You can see the specs. on the site, so I wont repeat them here;**** Movie**** Photo**** Interval**** Live**** Setup**** Play**** Power Off**** LoopThere is a wristband with integrated display(Live view remote), that you can control the camera remotely.  This makes it so slick and helps make the camera as small as it is.  You have a power on/off, and the same 3 buttons on the camera, so you can remotely control the camera. In addition you have a display and menu button  unique to this display.  The wristband will fit the meatiest wrist and has a wide rubber band that even when sweating, it wont slip.Some adhesive mounts (3) are included with the camera itself.First of all the plethora of accessories floored me.  This is is really made to stick to something, wear or attach to your head. The quantity may be due to this being a set made for review.  All Im sure can be purchased separately. The only real lack that occurred to me was that due to its shape, it could not be worn against your chest. With its longitudinal axis, the camera eye is on the end of the rectangle instead of the flat center of it. But on side of a helmet it might be less prone to damage versus sticking on top of one.**** Universal head mount**** Suction cup mountOUT OF THE BOXI found when I opened the package and started to charge everything that needed charging, that they were 75% charged already.  The camera battery is a separate one, but the wristband battery is an integrated piece. Both use a USB cable to charge.  The 64GB micro USB has to be put in the camera.  The sleeve for a regular SD slot is included.Once you have everything charged, you sync the camera to the Liveview remote.  What is also cool is there is a downloadable app that can be put on your smartphone to be used like the remote. Both synced smoothly.Starting up the camera and remote, I can see when they are syncing (5 seconds or so) and the next thing you know you have a live feed from the camera.  What struck me was the smooth display.  I was tempted to attach the camera to my cat, to see his perspective, but it really is too big.  A large dog could be a different story. Also for me to see the display, I dont know how far away he can wander before I lose the WiFi.SOFTWARE:On the startup guide you are recommended to go to Sonys website and download the PC software dedicated to the camera: Action Cam Movie Creator.  Using this in conjunction with Sonys  Play Memories Home you end up with a great combo of applications on your computer.  I had already had Sonys  Play Memories Home after the purchase of a Sony point and shoot camera a few years ago and liked the ease to transfer files.  Im sure you dont have to use that, but just indicated what I had.  For that matter you could use the microSD card to transfer.  However I tend to leave those little ones put, to avoid breaking them. However the Action Cam Movie Creator is the secret to manipulate your movies files in a variety of ways.INITIAL MOVIE:After everything was together, I briefly used the camera to walk around the house and take an untethered movie by holding the camera and wristband separately.  When I downloaded the movie, the smoothness of the play and the sound was great.  The SW allowed me to make some shorter videos.  Soon I will have a biking movie and a few kayaking ones.A CO-WORKERS USE OF THIS CAMERA:I lent this camera to a co-worker of mine who regularly walks his dog, by riding his bike.  He wanted to do a better than cell phone version of the process.  He had several complaints about this camera, mostly about the form factor.  If the camera were cylindrical or more camera like, a Go-Pro, he would have liked it better.  It could have been mounted on his chest or front of his helmet.  He wore the headset and felt really dorky.  He called it a shark fin.  Also he complained about no easy way to attach the camera to handle bars.  This maybe because it was not his camera and he was not going to duct tape it as he has done prior ones.  Also as far as the remote, on a bike he felt the width of the wrist strap was too wide on a bent wrist, and the positioning of the screen not suitable.  This was in a upright position, in a streamlined crouched position, he felt he could not get the screen view-able at all.  He was wondering if there was a way to widen or do a macro view, so you could see more off to the side and there was not, that he could see. For a dog off to the side this would have been nicer.  Instead he said the tighter angle would have been great for a bike race, something he gave up a year ago. Overall he gave the camera for his purposes (on bike or helmet) a thumbs down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJZOI1XA8DZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CO9X4#wasThisHelpful","R2TJZOI1XA8DZY","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the description of this book, I thought it sounded magical.  It did not disappoint.Perdu a Paris book seller has a unique venue.  He sells books from a boat.  Besides that he prescribes them, based on what he feels the reader needs.  This can be met with some opposition, but once the reader takes his advice, they keep coming back.  Perdu finds some comfort in books himself and has searched for an author of a unique book that has helped him, to no avail.Until Catherine moves into his building Perdu lives a spare life with little else.  However there is a room in his apartment that is never opened.  When he decides to give Catherine a table stored in this unopened room, old feelings are jarred and an unopened letter is found. When Catherine insists he open this old letter, this shakes Perdu to the core and this sets many events in motion. He decides the half life he has lead due to events in the past, needs closure and then an adventure begins.Im tiptoeing on not telling you too much.  This book is unique and anyone who has found answers in books can relate.  I really enjoyed the descriptions of the French countryside and the emotions described in the book.  We all experience things different from others and this book captures this well.  I may well read this book a second time as I enjoyed it so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ESUALTPLWR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418777#wasThisHelpful","R17ESUALTPLWR8","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I opted for this program in hope of restarting my exercise routine.  Sadly Im not ready for it.  Im going to have to ease into this, or abandon it. The reason this exercise is such an issue is two problems I have: damaged knees, so squatting and lunges are very limited and damage to my elbows (from using a pickax) so that push-ups are very challenging.  If these are not issues for you, this exercise routine may not be a problem. The rest and recovery sessions are mostly rolling out your legs with the foam roller and stretching using the strap.  No issue with those, but they are not the point of this set of DVDs.  A yoga class would address this as well.BACKGROUND:Im a 58 year old overweight woman, who has a sedentary job, though I do pilates, yoga, elliptical, line dancing and couples dancing every week. Outdoor hobbies are gardening, hiking and kayaking. Oh yes and babysitting grandkids, thats the hardest work of all.  So at home I am not sedentary, but far from a fit 20 year old and I do not do exercises everyday. Im most likely not the target audience.EQUIPMENT:**** 1 (5 pound) yellow kettlebell. (4 sizes shown in video, yellow, red, orange, blue)**** foam roller**** stretching strap (could substitute a yoga strap if needed)Note: several exercises  use 2 kettlebells and they use a round matt throughout. Rest and recovery rejuvenation uses a typical yoga mat (not included) and indicates taller people might use a longer foam rollerThere are also ads for equipment and supplements as well as a small meal plan booklet.DVDs provided:**** Introduction**** CARDIO: incinerate the fat**** CORE:  ripped to the core**** RESISTANCE: force the energy**** Supercharged CORE: elevate your strength**** Supercharged LOWER BODY: experience the intensity**** Supercharged UPPER BODY: feel the burn**** MUSCLE PREVENTION & RECOVERY with Rejuvenation (I got 2 identical DVDs of this)You get a chart of recommended exercises for each of 56 days. Pace and duration is implied in each set of exercises. The 2nd set of exercises each day (supercharged) are 10 minutes longer for those that are motivated.  Otherwise each days routine is 20 minutes long.  3 times a week, however there is a rest and rejuvenation routine.Example of first week:Day 1: Basic Resistance strike, Supercharged Core BurnDay 2: Rest and Recovery, RejuvenationDay 3: Basic Core Rock, Supercharged Lower Body BurnDay 4: Rest and Recovery, RejuvenationDay 5: Basic Cardio Ignite, Supercharged Upper Body BurnDay 6: Supercharged Core BurnDay 7: Rest and Recovery, RejuvenationThe type of exercises included for the Day 1 and Day 2:Day 1: Basic Resistance strike (issues with knees and elbows)**** Squat with upright row (tough on my knees)**** Lunge and overhead press (tough on my knees)**** Renegade row**** Offset push up (hard on elbows)****  Figure 8 with a bicep curl (easy to drop kettlebell)Day 1: Supercharged Core Burn (if you do pilates, can do this, but one balance move)**** Crunch with kettlebell to chest**** Twisting crunch with leg extension**** Floating half moon (balance)**** Bridge with kettlebell on pelvis**** Twist with a kettlebell punchDay 2: Rest and Recovery, Rejuvenation (music with this is not relaxing, but too loud & intense)Separated into equipment typesFoam roller:**** glute (butt)**** hamstring (back of leg)**** it band (outside of leg)**** quad (front of leg)Stretch strap: all of these are yoga derived**** hamstring (back of leg stretch)**** adductor (inside of leg stretch)**** abductor (outside of leg stretch)**** glute (butt stretch) really did not emphasize holding ankle straight, potential for knee damage**** quad (front of leg stretch)Overall, this strikes as an aggressive aerobic based workout, that might get results but also might make you ache.  I tend to prefer pilates and yoga for the lack of ache, but Ill not likely ever get a six pack that way.  Pick your poison.  For a busy young person this might be quite the routine as it is brief and doable at home.  For me the potential for ache and even damage is too great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PM7GBVFRZGZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFP51PY#wasThisHelpful","R3PM7GBVFRZGZT","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Georgia is imagining a wedding to the man she loves back at her parents idyllic winery.  Unfortunately all is not what it seems.  During her dress fitting she observes something that sets her world askew and decides to run home, to sort out her thoughts.However at home all it not warm and cozy.  Her parents have some surprising news and her two brother's seem equally unsettled.This is a fun read.  I had a hard time putting the book down.  The ups and downs, the indecision.  Family life at it's finest and the ending, while not a complete surprise while reading the book is certainly a twist unanticipated.I like the author's sense of action and introspection.  You see what drives Georgia's thoughts.  While at times there are things unsaid, you see what the character's conclusions are.

"The first third of this book is the authors recounting of all of the issues she has had due to this gap in her brain. Essentially her life has been a trainwreck.  Shes had issues with some very basic stuff: crossing the street, managing her time, keeping paperwork straight and navigating.  She loses a lot of jobs, that require these basic skills and luckily has her parents as back up.  It gets really slow, as she cites all her work and personal life screw-ups. I think she attempted to relay her frustration, but it feels so detached.  She talks further about the testing she goes through to understand what is causing these issues and is somewhat dispassionately plugging along through this.  What struck me is that many of her associates and family members had mental issues of their own. Her father is considered to have Aspergers, but that doesnt excuse some of the jerky things that he does.  He teaches ethics but seems not very ethical or considerate.  In fact it seems his students think so as well.About mid book things pick up and the author starts college and finds her tribe in some sense.  She has some close friends and boyfriend.  At some point she got some good advice and found she was eligible for federal aid as a disabled person and went through the convoluted testing process required to establish this.  The book starts to pick up and you can see the author is struggling with trying to cope and also since categorized as disabled realizing that this is who she now is and dealing with that.  Her writing is excellent.  I think the first part of the books suffers from trying to be too matter of fact and that is not her strong suit.  She has issues apparently with time and this may have affected her ability to keep a play by play narrative with some life in it.The latter part of her book chronicles her issues with her boyfriend and landing a job she likes.  There are still issues and she is struggling to be a person with an invisible handicap.  In fact if you think about, as you are reading this book you might wonder, how is this person handicapped, as she writes so well?  That unfortunately would be the painful assumption others have made about her.  Unlike many of us who go to the doctor for diagnosis, there is some sort of resolution on the other end.  In the authors case, it is just an explanation of her issues and except for few attempts to help her cope she seems on her own to come up with strategies to improve her lot.  At this point it is familiar and will color everything she does and every relationship she has.  She is correctly considered as handicapped, but it would be nice to see that she was offered more coping mechanisms in any counseling she received.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QEZD2PCC7QG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791892#wasThisHelpful","R3QEZD2PCC7QG1","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hesitated getting this book over concern for being sad over the subject matter.  I was wrong to do that.  It is a book about life, not death and that makes it wonderful.Scott Simon, the author did not not have a traditional life, having grown up not only in a mixed religious family, his family was broken by the days standards. However I would bet, he would not trade it for anything.His Mom is dying and in her last days in the hospital she and her son reminisce about their shared past. The author tweeted some of this while experiencing this and has included this in the book so you get a sense of immediacy while reading, like it is still just happening.Rather than hide some of the awkwardness of his past (an alcoholic father) and some promiscuity by his Mother and grandmother (relative to the days mores) he puts it all out there and shares the love that he was surrounded by.  He and is Mom were right in the middle of the hot society of the day and were surrounded by kindred souls that made life interesting. Family is not always just the people you are related to.The only part of this book that bothered me, was when the Mom talked of her own Moms suicide and how it marred her as a grown adult. Her son is solicitous and concerned. She never acknowledges to her son, for nearly following in her Mothers foot steps, in a worst way when he was still quite young.  Her own attempt is mentioned earlier in the book and revolves around an impossible relationship at the time. It would have left her son homeless and alone at the time and I found it appalling and selfish.While I appreciate his Mom for the free spirit she was and it sound like she had a bit of style and class.  She appreciated people who worked hard like she did.  Conventional she was not.  While expensive Thank you notes, a nice table with place cards is quite formal,  her young son saw a lot of nightlife and was around some less than conventional situations. .  Some people, certainly in that time frame might have been very critical.  however it may well have made her son the man he is today.  As a journalist a critical and observant eye are necessary and flexibility is an advantage as well. A more conventional life might have made him limited.The author also captures the hardworking office staff, nurses, aides even janitors.  He was less than complimentary on the doctors who were elusive at best.  As I have had an elderly parent in the hospital, I too have noticed they tend to direct from a distance. Reading a lot of medical oriented books, you get the false sense that the interns, doctors and patients get chummy, but the reality is, that is long before they become a specialist.Overall, this book was hard to put down and a true celebration of the authors mothers life.  A fitting tribute.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8T3L7AZQNBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006113X#wasThisHelpful","R2X8T3L7AZQNBG","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is really hard to imagine that transition of book knowledge to clinical, where a person goes from taking in the information, to applying it to people.  Not being in a medical field, I cant imagine this, but this book gets you closer.  It also gives you a feeling for the insecurity associated with that experience as well. As inexperienced people are reeling with concern for being able to provide quality care, concern for making a mistake and dealing with real patients, they are also subjected to 30 hours straight of work for several days.  A side note: This staggers me, with all the studies showing that fatigue increases errors, we still allow interns to be put through this gauntlet, still.  We have laws for truckers, so it would seem it would not be unreasonable to do the same for the people that literally have our health in their hands.  But, that is not what this book is about.Matt the author opted out of a minor league baseball career and decided medicine was where is next challenge should be.  An interesting choice, but thankfully he is a good writer and documented his seminal first year.  From learning how to stitch a banana, to assisting in the operating room, he rotated through cardiology, intensive care, infectious care (not what its called) and several other twists as well. We see him begin to mature while learning under some very different supervisory styles.  It is good that many of the people that he dealt with really shared useful ways of working from faking it till you make it, to all the anagrams to remember what is important.  The one thing that stood out to me was a statement another doctor made to him, that when you think about is chilling.  The other doctor said you have to decide who you are watching out for; Yourself or the Patient?  This prompted him to report an accidental needle stick in a patients bladder, that prior to thinking this through he was contemplating ignoring this, which could have potentially lead to infection for the patient.  How many others when learning opt to forget mistakes that cause patient issues or worse, to cover their own hide?This book is definitely an insiders look of what goes on during the first year.. Its entertaining, scary and sad at the same time.  Well written, Im sure the author has a few more in his future and Ill be waiting for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U3I6W48SRVFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138656#wasThisHelpful","R1U3I6W48SRVFX","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having recently purchased an ipad air, I wanted to pair it with a keyboard and Im happy to say this keyboard is everything you could want in a keyboard.It is secure, no chance of my ipad air falling out.All the pertinent buttons: volume, display and power are accessible.It solidly stays in keyboard position, even when on one knee or held with one handIt allows for use as a tablet with the keyboard nicely folded in.The keyboard is metal and solid and secure. Pairing was dicey at first, but once charged, no problem. In use it was seamless and everything I wanted. The only extra I could want was a touch pad on the keyboard, but from what I understand that is not possible on an ipad.The keyboard is small, but works, well. You open the keyboard up, the ipad display turns on, you close it the ipad turns off. The magnetics keep the display solidly in position.

"This is my 5th Patrick Lee book.  Having started with Ghost country and its prequel the Breach, I continued on to Deep sky the last of that series and then the first of the Sam Dryden series; Runner.I think given, I am on his 5th book, it is clear I like this authors approach to writing and his Sci-Fi subject matter appeals to me.  My preferences are unimportant to you, but I will give you my logic, to see if you agree.Why do I keep coming back?For one I have a hard time putting the books down.  Similar to Dan Brown of the DaVinci code fame, his chapters are short and to the point and progress you forward.  Sometimes you see whats coming and other times you are blindsided, as is the main character.  It gets  your mind moving.It is real science? Um no, not exactly and the world is a safer place for it.  Is it conceivable?  Absolutely, so you can imagine this kind of stuff happening.  All good SciFi asks you to suspend disbelief and go along with the author.  If that trip is too far, you are grimacing in discomfort.  If it only pushes the edge a bit and just that bit further, you are sucked in.  Similar to David Brin of The Postman fame and Uplift series, you get educated along the way in in what you need to know and its not work, to understand the technology of the book. In comparison, I just finished anothers authors book and he felt the need to overdevelop characters and give too many technological explanations, so instead of a 300 page book it was 1200 pages.  You will not find that here.  The writing is tight, fun and to the point.Now...you want to know a bit about the story? I have to be careful not to ruin it.  Sam Dryden is a former special-ops guy.  He gets contacted by an old friend in distress. Claire asks him to join her in a wild ride across the state and is very paranoid about anyone knowing where he is going.  She is anxious and pretty closed-mouth about what is going on.  When they save some young people at the brink of dying; Sam wonders how their timing could be so impeccable and how Claire knew this was going to happen?  What she tells him is so far out-there he does not believe her until she demonstrates.  Later he finds out why she recruited him and that blows his mind even further.  And here the story begins.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMT4ZMUE31W8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030781#wasThisHelpful","RMT4ZMUE31W8C","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book interested me on a few levels.  One being female in a technical field, Im very much aware of womens roles changing over the years.  Spinster is an old term, so I wanted to see how this was approached in this day and age.The author a sporadic spinster discusses her own life and that of some women from the past, all authors or artists that have lived a solo or at least partially solo life.  She goes into a bit of detail on 5 of them (author: Edna Millay, essayist: Maeve Brennan, columnist: Neith Boyce, novelist: Edith Wharton and social visionary: Charlotte Perkins Gilman).  These are pertinent, as they lived, what would be considered as spinsters by choice.She talks of the aspirations of women in the past relative to men and how it was assumed most women anticipated marriage as the more desirable option. Living as a solo person financially was often not available to those without independent resources, as women in general were always expected to be dependent on a man, thus their lower wages were justified (stomach burns as I type this).  The few women that pursued the single life had to fight to be considered seriously (while bachelors were lauded) and only the wealthy did so with style.Skip forward a few generations and women living alone still have issues with the finances of living alone (sadly for the same reasons), but the boarding houses for single women no longer exist. As an aside, I found out years ago when I visited Japan, that they have this equivalent, so single women can afford housing in the cities there).The author speaks of her on again and off again pursuit of spinsterhood and you can  understand her logic.  Alone you think different than when you are part of a couple.  Different plans, different outlook. I get this.  As a writer whose work is made up mostly of thoughts and ideas this can certainly change your craft as well. However, Im not sure I would consider the author a spinster.  Her dating was more on the serious side and not as widespread as to discourage assumptions of leading to marriage (as were some of her historical examples, though some did get married).  She on two occasions walked out of relationships that the men felt on the brink of marriage as did their families.  I think most of us consider the philosophy of living alone and not being in a serious relationship as the definition of spinsterhood.  So her lifestyle was for the most part not spinsterish by that definition..Overall the book is interesting. Its funny to think that years ago, this was on the horizon and it still seems to be, but the numbers now would seem to support it.  However I wonder how many women are single (like myself) but living with someone (also like me), which I dont think fulfills the true role of the spinster. I think people have eschewed the formalities but still tend to pair up to a certain extent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OKX7R4T2OE2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347138#wasThisHelpful","R3OKX7R4T2OE2A","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this little dust buster with some trepidation.  Having used a pet hair vacuum with a cord that I was less than impressed with, how could a cordless do any better?  Well, it does and it doesnt.  I have 4 cats, so I can speak to how it handled cat  hair.  Dog people, youre on your own.  Dog hair is longer and more wiry (my observation when I had labs).SUMMARY:ProOkay on non-embedded cat hair, not greatGreat for car vacuum (pine needles and croissant crumbs)Keeps stuff in the vacuumNice to empty, easily cleanable.ConPower button is easy to constantly hit and turn off during usageCant touch embedded hair (but what can?)MECHANICS:Essentially you have three ways to use this.  without any attachments, with a nubby rubberized wide attachment and with a nozzle attachment that has a brush slide down.One thing I noticed on this vacuum is that it has a little door in it, that when it is vacuuming in, it opens and when items are in the vacuum they get trapped behind this door.  I have had other vacuums when turned off allowed the previously vacuumed stuff to fall out.  This resolves that.Emptying this vacuum was decent.  It was easy to open and the parts came apart nicely to clean off.During use this vacuums power button is unfortunately in a lousy location.  The one problem I had with it, was constantly turning it off.Power from the charge was plenty to clean my car, so would probably be okay around the house.VACUUMING PET HAIRFor the cat hair on their cat tree and in their cat beds.  As this is embedded, I didnt hold much hope and was not surprised when this was barely touched.  Usually on the washable beds I take an old bristle brush to scrub off the cat hair, before I wash the cat bed.  This requires a real manual effort and that nubby attachment is not rough enough to do this.  Also being at the end of a vacuum, you have no mechanical advantage to scrub it around.For the cat hair on other items like a cloth covered chair or futon.  This vacuum worked well.  The nubby end released the hair from the fabric nicely.GREAT AS A CAR VACUUMWhat I found this vacuum worked really great for, was in my car.  I have pine trees all around my house and I get pine needles in the car all the time.  This did a great job on that and the little door kept them in the vacuum.  It also did a great job on the croissant crumbs I got all over the front seat (a guilty pleasure as Im driving to see my Mom in a nursing home every Saturday).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8IFJULCXBMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW8TL9O#wasThisHelpful","R1R8IFJULCXBMS","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had opted to get this book, because I thought it would be more a personal story, or biography and how outside events affected the peoples day-to-day lives.In reading this book, I was given a lot of historical facts about the events around the personal story.  In fact the book was 70% history, 30% biography. However, I still do not understand fully why the family moved to Pakistan from India, as it seemed their community was intact there and the grandfather was being offered a position of honor.  Clearly the family was given the impression that it would be better to live in a country, that was more dominated by Muslims.Later in the book they discussed what it took to be considered a native. It would seem people that were born in that country had all the advantages, but you were only considered a native, if that went back enough generations (about 3).  With that mindset most of the US would still be considered as immigrants.  Unlike the US this greatly influenced schooling opportunities and jobs.  Amazing.I would have liked more of a story of the family  this book was centered around and less history.However, this book was eye opening.  I have had several colleagues from India telling me about what it was like to live there, but only recently a female colleague and I was appalled to realize the difference between a mans life and that of a woman, and that is India.  In Pakistan due to being a country dominated by Islam, it is even more different.  Imagine living in a country where you are considered only  that of another person and that is due to your gender.  You can have the same pedigree as your spouse and he can still treat you like property.  I cant imagine what it is like in the workplace, when the home life is like this.  Im utterly mystified then how Benazir Bhutto ever came to power.  They sort of addressed this in the book, but not really.  It would seem the politics in the country are really that corrupt.The final chapter in the personal story was heartbreaking.  Aminas angst over the 2nd wife dominated her life and her husbands comments to her in the end regarding this, made this even worse.  The bottom line in this relationship is that she had no choice.  His control was complete.This is maddening and unfortunately in this country this is not getting any better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0VLHL0AY790/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807003360#wasThisHelpful","RO0VLHL0AY790","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine lent me this book as she knew of my interest in wine.  So over the course of several months, at lunch time (or waiting for my computer to boot up), I read a little bit each day.While how I read it, is of little interest to you, it shows that you can read it nicely in small bites.Having read another wine book, it was not easily digested in small sets of reading, so this was a nice feature.This book first of all dated~2002, is well...dated, so some varieties of wines have changed. But, lets face it, wines been around a long time, so the fundamentals are intact.  The author nicely covers a whole bunch of things in small groupings.The chapters:*** Introduction*** Tools of the trade*** Its all about flavor*** Taste the earth*** Sugar, Sugar*** Firewater*** Getting Wood*** Fiddling Around*** Old verus New*** Tall, Dark & Handsome*** Posh Wines*** Party Wines*** Froth & Bubble*** Pensioned Off*** Altered States*** Wines your Granny Drinks*** Coming Back to your Roots*** IndexYou can see from the titles the first 8 chapters set you up with the lingo. However in each of these chapters, there is a section called Drinking it, that addresses the chapter covered.  The next 9 chapters about specific aspect of wines.I found this book very pleasant to read bit by bit and I have to say I also learned something in the process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XD2NA16VNW2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1840005130#wasThisHelpful","R1XD2NA16VNW2W","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This biography of Shannon Miller is just that.  The author/co-writer gives you all the facts and figures, all the stats and details of this amazing gymnast.  Her fortitude to train for 3 Olympics, though only making it to 2 and subsequent cancer diagnosis and recovery.  The writing is good and flows from one point to another.  Shannon clearly owns her successes and mistakes.  90% of the book is about Shannon the gymnast; 10% about the cancer survivor.My above paragraph is devoid of sentiment and merely states the content of the book. Similarly I felt this book lacked emotion.  It was a recounting of an amazing past without the associated emotion.  After reading this book, I went to youtube to see some of the videos of her performances and was taken back to the Olympics I watched at the time.  I remember looking at a tiny emotionless girl.  She had the most amazing skills yet, kept all her pride and joy locked inside.  This is an amazing woman.  Unfortunately the title of the book captures the conundrum of the book, ""It's not about Perfect"". I really felt in what I read, is that it is ""all about perfect"".  I feel she has not allowed herself to enjoy what she has done but has punished herself for what she did not do.  Sadly that might the case for many of these athletes that push against an impossible bar.  How many get injured or age out and never make it this far. While reading this I kept on thinking; ""If only"".Please do not let this discourage from reading this. It really is an amazing story from a  young girl that truly wanted to be perfect.  Little does she realize that she achieved that.  ""Perfect is in the trying"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMXJ3N4IFJVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049865#wasThisHelpful","R3QMXJ3N4IFJVP","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dollar for Dollar, if you are in the market for an inexpensive smartphone, this would not be a bad one for an entry level.  If you are used to Samsung, it might disappoint, but your pocket will be fuller.IN THE BOX:Phone, charging cable with ability to separate USB from plug, screen protector, rubberized case and headphones.Also a tool to put the SIM card in place.  Manual in 3 languages (English is the 3rd language).SETUP:Owning a Samsung S4 and this being my 2nd Android phone, I was stunned with the ease of the setup.  Put in the code for my wireless, added my google account and everything was added from my previous phone, apps, contacts the works.  Of course this does not include the pictures on the card, or in the phone.  However having gone through setups in the past, none have gone this smoothly.NO CELL PLAN YET:At this time, I don't have a cell plan for this phone, since I am on Verizon and this phone in incompatible.  I plan to get a pay as you go account for it, through AT&T (due to connectivity issues in areas of the Adirondacks) and haven't researched that yet. However I have it hooked to wireless at home and it works quite nicelySCREEN & BUTTON DIFFERENCES:Since I'm familiar with the S4 and a bit with the S5, the screens through me a bit on this.  Power button is on the left near the volume button. However there does not seem to be the ability to do shortcuts on the home screen.  Makes it a bit of a mess but everything is right there.SPECS:Given, I should not compare this to the older S4 that I have, but instead the S5, here are some of the differences:  Clearly the Samsung wins at specsmanship.  But at a ~$480 to the BLU's $199, it should. A price difference $281 justifies it. But the BLU is lighter and slightly smaller.BLU VIVO AIR: 5.5 x 2.6 x 0.2 inches ; 3.2 ouncesSAMSUNG S5: 5.59 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches ; 5.1 ouncesBLU VIVO AIR: BACK CAMERA: 8MPSAMSUNG S5: BACK CAMERA: 16 MPBLU VIVO AIR: FRONT CAMERA: 5MP 88 degree wide angleSAMSUNG S5: FRONT CAMERA: 2MP wide angleBLU VIVO AIR: 1.7 GHz Octa-core processorSAMSUNG S5: 2.5GHz Quad core processorBLU VIVO AIR: RAM: 1GBSAMSUNG S5: RAM : 2GBBLU VIVO AIR: 4.8"" HD Super AMOLED  (720 x 1280) 306 ppiSAMSUNG S5: 5.1"" FHD Super AMOLED (1920 x 1080) 432 ppiBLU VIVO AIR: Battery is 2100 mAh non-removable. This gives me pause.SAMSUNG S5: 2800mAh removableBLU VIVO AIR:  16 GB internal storage with no SD card expansionSAMSUNG S5: 16/32GB User Memory + microSD slot (up to 128GB)POINT OF COMPARISON:At this stage I have had a Samsung S4 for greater than 2 years.  I'm eligible for a new phone, but since I'm on Verizon, I'm not able to put this phone on my plan. Would I if I could? No. It is comparable in size to my S4, but smaller than the S5.  I was thinking of going a bit larger.  The price by far is cheaper than the S5 (see specs above), but I'm holding out for the Note 4 or the Samsung Galaxy S6 for my next phone.ACCESSORIES:There seem to be a lot of accessories on Amazon for this phone, wallets, cases, etc.  But, there do not seem to be any hard plastic vertical belt holsters.  This is something I prefer and I don't know why I have not found any.  They have horizontal folding wallet ones, plain plastic ones,  but no plastic ones with a clip, as yet, that I see.  Maybe this is limited to the larger manufacturers or it is too soon.This is not my review, but one I read on this phone after I had it for awhile: http://pocketnow.com/2015/02/21/blu-vivo-air-review","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26YXC1Z2R46NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5C3BCY#wasThisHelpful","R26YXC1Z2R46NR","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always like cooking-related books, so I was a shoe-in for getting this one.  Then while reading it, I discovered one of the authors was the same that authored two other books, I already owned. Cool!Pam, Sharon and Maggie (or is it Maggy, inside joke) are a Mom and 2 daughters all talking about a shared love: Cooking and especially sharing a meal with family and friends.  There is some backstory, some biography and some recipes that factor in each.  You see how each has gotten into cooking; some earlier, some later and how it all gels (or not) when they get together.All together makes it an enjoyable book to read.The recipes included are pivotal to the stories within.The two books I have How to cook without a book and Perfect Recipes by Pam Anderson have sat on my shelf for some time.  One is a cookbook I have consulted on several occasions, another is a philosophy of cooking style cookbook.  The thought process being that if you learn some basics you can be less reliant on cookbooks.  Im making an effort to read and review this once, I have finished this book.  I will look at the more traditional cookbook as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AE0M2UQ6533/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417895X#wasThisHelpful","R4AE0M2UQ6533","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shirley Maclaine, is of course unique and if you have read some of her other books she has some interesting observations and has indicated she has had visions or dreams of other worlds.If this is problem for you, this book may be an issue, but a minor one, as this book is primarily about walking the Camino.  Not unlike others she has had some various spiritual awakenings as she continued. However she did have a lot of press interference, but maybe that is also part of her path.The Camino is a path in Spain of approximate 500 miles that people walk for a variety of reasons.  As it has a spiritual past many are seeking understanding of a spiritual nature. However if you read Wild a book by Cheryl Strayed, the act of walking a long distance alone provides insight, if nothing else due to the solitude, change in location and physical duress the walker endures.Ive had the Camino book  in my collection for a bit and was planning on reading it, then the perfect opportunity presented itself.  While reading another book where the author Kevin Sessums planned on walking the Camino also mentioned Shirleys book.  I decided to read the two simultaneously.  Though Kevin Sessums book is only partly about his time on the Camino (less than 25%) it was still interesting to see the contrast.  He too took a day to day approach and kept a journal.  Similarly he had some spiritual experiences.I like that Shirley MacLaine documented her trip, from the formation of the idea to do the walk to the various towns along the way. You understood her motivation, her concerns and issues that she was dealing with.  I admire her for taking the option to stay in the hostels along the way, though this proved problematic with the issues she had with the press.Overall this was a nice read.  You get a sense that she got what she came for and despite the presss best efforts they did not deter her, nor sensationalized her attempt (maybe then they did at the time, but I dont think it overly affected the book).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTTZ3DQSYWZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743400739#wasThisHelpful","R3UTTZ3DQSYWZ7","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a combination biography and coming to terms with life and how its been lived by a man very much on the periphery of exalted showbiz circles and he also at the beginning drops a lot of famous names.  The name dropping put me off at first, but it was mostly only at the start of the book and occasionally here and there. However, his writing flows right along. The man  knows his craft.Hes lived a pretty racy life.  His descriptions of drug use and sexual encounters are a bit unsettling, but only make up a small portion of the book (less than 2%). Mind you, he is also contemplating the effects and meaning of this, as he is getting older. You can see his sudden awkwardness in some situations as he contemplates it.  He chooses to directly address this, in this book. Mind you like most addicts he had to hit the bottom before he started back up.  What troubled me, as the author is HIV positive; with the sexual encounters, is that I never felt the disease slowed him down from pursuing these encounters. Despite having no relationship with the partners, I still wondered if they knew he was HIV positive.  His assessing of younger men, as potential partners at some times seemed predatory.  But, maybe thats the way some men think and he is being more honest than most.At first the way the book jacket described, I thought there was an epiphany early on, where the author had decided to change his life and anticipated recollections on his way to doing that or what led up to it.  But, its not really constructed that way, but more a combination of the last several years of his life and a major coming to terms, but also all the things he is mulling on.  We all have themes that keep coming up in our life that shape us and you can see the author is no exception.Overall the book is well written.  The author is well known for years in the business of entertainment writing and that is evident here.  The chapter names prepare you for the contents of each chapter. He describes many aspects of his life, the sordid, the day to day and the sweet.He is clearly an intelligent contemplative man that is struggling with life.  This book is how he is trying to sort it out.An aside: Since early in the book he mentions planning walking the Camino and planning on reading Shirley MacLaine's book of that name, since I had it in my collection, I started reading it too..  Though the two did not walk the Camino simultaneously for me they did and it was nice to see the contrast.  I found his recollection much briefer (as of course an entire book was not dedicated to it) and similar in its mysticism.  While Shirley MacLaine had visions, this author had a few unique situations and synchronicity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Q1FCY4JJ8G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312598386#wasThisHelpful","R34Q1FCY4JJ8G5","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The full first half of this books tells you why this approach works.  Finally in the second half you get down to brass tacks.If you have at all read the more recent ""Discovery"" based books, you will already know that to get ahead to the next best thing in design, you must test out various hypotheses of designs and then act on the ones that are successful.However this book tells you the success of the design also is dependent on how ""doable"" this hypothesis is and then gives you an aggressive framework to work this into.They then go on to suggest that designing experiments in a 5 X 5 framework enables you to cover the width and breadth of what is needed to go forward.Let me share with you some things I have highlighted in the book.  This way it will speak for itself.ON THE ASPECT OF THE ABILITY TO DO THE IDEA:""In other words, if you can't do it, it `s not a good idea. If you can't do it well, it's not a good idea. If you can't afford to do it, it's not a good idea. If you can afford to do it well, it's not a good idea. If you refuse to do it, it's not a good idea.""""Implementation - not the idea - is the superior unit of analysis for assessing value creation. On this theme the author talks of Sam Walton's assertion that ""Most of us don't invent ideas. We take the best ideas of someone else.  While this may be true; Walton didn't take the best ideas for his company, he took what he saw with his own eyes, that actually worked.  What was the breakthrough behavior? Walmart baked implementability into it's internal innovation process.HOW THE IDEAS ARE PORTRAYED IS IMPORTANT:""Words are not pictures are not prototypes.  Initial expressions of ideas powerfully influence their ultimate implement-ability.""  As a UI person, just mocking something up also influences the design. What might seem like a good idea in concept can fall apart in practice, but once it holds nicely when prototyped is also serves as a solid tool for persuasion.USERS ACTION SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS:As a usability professional, I see this over and over. User testing is a method that clearly shows what people will do, not what they say they will do.ON INVESTING IN EXPERIMENTS:""Don't invest in experiments to solve problems or create opportunities. Invest in experiments to quickly, cheaply and easily gain insight into solving problems and exploiting opportunities. The best experiments purchase actionable insights at fantastic discounts and with remarkable speed.""FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTAL VALUE:Amazon's business model: ""We don't many money when we sell things; we make money when we help customers make purchase decision"".  Hence acceptance of negative reviews of products.ASPECT OF 5 X 5 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN;""Design depends largely on constraints. Here is one of the effective keys to the design problem: the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible (and) his or her willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. By insisting on constraints 5 X 5 portfolios dramatically improve the likelihood that they will generate high impact, high value returns on investment.""RESISTANCE AS A MEASURE:""Resistance offers a remarkably clear window into understanding the internal culture an organizational dynamics of innovation culture."" As an example of some responses to designs:*** It cost too much*** The lawyers won't let us*** Our biggest supplier would be upset*** Marketing wouldn't like it*** That's not the business we are in5 X 5 X 5 DESIGN AND CONSTRAINTSA minimum of5 teams of5 people with no more than5 days to come up with5 business experiments that should take no longer than5 weeks to run and cost no more than5,000 euros to conduct.Each experiment should have a business case attached that explains how running that experiment gives tremendous insight into a possible savings of 5 millions euros or a 5 million euro growth opportunity for the firm.""The 5 X 5 methodology is more about investment in human capital and capabilities than it is about innovation and experimentation."" The 5 X 5 isn't about financial capital; it's about human capital.  Don't ask for money, ask for access - to people, to time, to technology.  As for meeting space.""If  you can't write a 200 word mission statement explaining why your organization needs 5 X 5 experimentation launched within the next 100 days, the you are not ready to champion it. Authentic ""whys"" attract authentic support""SOLUTIONS VERSUS COUNTERMEASURES:When the company performs root cause analysis, it doesn't want managers and workers reflexively proposing solutions.  A solution orientation promotes dysfunctional and even destructive expectations. Toyota instead asks its people to propose countermeasures.  The word solution implies solution. However solution may ultimately create problems of it's own. The countermeasure concept invites experimentation and appreciation of contingency and context.GREAT DISAGREEMENTSIn industry often there are disagreement of what is fundamentally important.  Google tested what is more important more results or more speed.  They found when they experimented with this and provided more results, it took longer to display than the less results which displayed quicker. Traffic dropped by 20% when the more results took longer to display, so they got the answer to their fundamentation questions.""No one ignores experiments to resolve or illuminate the firms most significant or controversial business arguments"".HOW DO X TEAMS FAIL AND SUCCEED:Your team fails if:*** your conversations become echo chambers of top managements cliches*** if it's business insights sound like escapees from tired executives educational webinars*** if your business hypotheses read like last years strategic visions*** if your proposed business experiments sound like warmed over market research*** if your portfolio doesn't reflect your teams intrinsic ingenuitySuccess begins with*** respecting your teams talents.*** respecting your firms needs and market potential*** from self organizing to tap individual and collective experience and expertiseCULTURE OF THE IMPERFECT IS THE WAY TO GO:Sir Robert Watson-Watt was a master of experimentation demonstration. His culture of the imperfect essay beautifully captures the design ethos that made his investments in experiments so successful: ""Give them the third best to go on with; the second best comes too late; the best never comes.""INCENTIVES MATTER:Incentives also matter. Consider how many businesses internally recognize and reward new ideas. Now how many companies explicitly celebrate and share provocative hypotheses and experiments? Those celebrations are cultural and operational norms at Capital One, Amazon and the like.  What gets measured gets managed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4E28V77TNG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262028360#wasThisHelpful","R2G4E28V77TNG9","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SIMPLE TO USE:Very simple.  If you put the small plug in the charger, the big plug goes in your computer, so it stores up a charge.  If you put the big plug in the charger and the small plug in your phone, you are charging your phone.SIZE AND STORAGE:It's the same size as my phone but it has a cable, so I keep it in the zip lock bag it came in with the cable and toss it in my purse.SOME BACKGROUND:First of all you need to know I have a Samsung S4 with a replacement battery. I always have GPS, Bluetooth and Wireless on, even when charging.First use of this charger, when it was at 4 lights of charge: I put my phone on it at 37% and after an hour it got my phone up to 83%.  A 46% charge in one hour; not bad.  Better than my car charger does.Second use when, I had charged it, but it sat in my purse for 4 days so it was down to 3 lights.  I put it on my phone at 28% and after 45 minutes it took it up to 61%.  So a 33% charge in 45 minutes.  Still pretty good.EMERGENCY USE IS WELL WORTH IT:I keep this little charger in my purse when not charging and today it really came in handy.  My cat had knocked my phone off the charger in the night, so this AM, I had a critical battery level  Still I had to head out and wanted a working phone.  Tossed the phone in my purse regardless and hooked it up on this little charger.  The next time I looked at it, it was at 43%...Cool!.Whenever I use it I charge it, so when I need it, it's ready.How does this compare to other charges of it's type or even the higher capacity one?  Couldn't help you there. This is the only one I have ever had.  But, I do know my boyfriend and co-worker are planning on getting one, seeing mine.

"This is my first Kelly Link book and I can tell you right away, her stories are strange. Most recently I read Margaret Atwood for the first time and found her stories unsettling and unique.  I would have to put Kelly Link in that same boat and maybe a nose ahead in that regard.The stories are told in a narrative viewpoint with the main character recounting what is happening.  If they have a peculiar view of the world, their delusions filter your story. I found the story; Secret Identity in its dropping into a RPG game recounting such that you can see the character is compelled to make comparisons when she ends up at a hotel where a Superhero conference is going on.You really dont know how its going to end, but you are intrigued to read on...and see where the twist will lead you.Ive found another author to intrigue me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TN1G2XOCV668/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179689#wasThisHelpful","R1TN1G2XOCV668","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew the title was over the top, but I thought, what the heck, let's check this out.While I feel the information within is interesting and not dissimilar to my own beliefs, the topic is covered in such an ""authoritative"" tone as to beg disbelief.  That is a pity.It is also somewhat repetitive and preachy at times.This book will provide a measure of comfort for those who have lost loved ones. But, it will provide the skeptics ample opportunities to shred it.  Maybe they would shred it anyway.Hay House I have noted is somewhat known for the more esoteric titles. While there are some books, even though the topic matter had been a bit ""out there"" covered the information a bit more softly with supposition and logic and recognizing this is not necessarily mainstream belief.  This one is stating as fact and that is not (in my humble opinion) the best way to approach something like this.At the beginning reading it had a nice momentum and held my interest, but at about the halfway point it became a struggle to finish. Maybe that means the book was too long or said too much about each topic.I did like the letter from the departed loved one at the end of each chapter.Even though you can search within the book, I will include the chapters here so you get a flavor of the whole.The chapters are:*** Introduction*** We're not dead*** There's no  such thing as devil or hell*** We were ready*** You're not ready*** We're sorry for any pain we caused*** Your dreams can really come true*** Heaven is going to blow your mind*** Life is more than fair*** Your old pets are as crazy as ever*** Love is the way, truth is the path*** Epilogue*** Recommended Reading*** Acknowledgements*** About the Author","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSXYHLQR7FW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945562#wasThisHelpful","R2VSXYHLQR7FW6","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From the traditional family, to adoptive families, to single parents, to disabled parents and same-sex partners.There are also stories that recognize the wrenching aspect of adoption from the birthmother's view, to those who care for the children in the interim.

"I have always struggled with taking close up pictures of items and when I saw this camera, I thought cool.  Not too expensive, if it works half okay, it will be fun to play with.  This was my Christmas gift to me.OPENING THE BOX:The item was well packed.  There was the camera, a cute little bag case a cable and batteries.  The batteries unfortunately had leaked but since they were in the back and in cellophane damaged was minimized.  I have tons of these at home anyways.  There is no camera card, so you have to provide your own. I also had quite a few of these too.PHYSICAL APPEARANCE:Looks like a nice little camera.  Mine was purple as it stated.  Seems durable. Seems also like old technology as the screen seemed a bit dated.USING THE CAMERA:Instructions were brief, but I know my way around cameras, so I figured out most of what I had to do.A button to turn on the camera, one for the light. Another to review and one for menu.  Also one for Camera/video. A rotate lens thing that adjusts the focus and a zoom button.Yup, No shutter button.  I had read this was the case, but since I want to only picture inanimate objects I figured it would be no problem Wrong, BIG problem.  With the focus being as tight as it has to be, no matter how I tried I could not photograph a penny on the table with any level of clarity.  After an hour I gave up.The menu, to delete a photo was utterly hysterical to use.  If I recall (as I have packaged it up to return, before I wrote this), press review, then delete which doubles as the menu button and then choose the two buttons above to go up or down.  Choose all or this image to delete.  And then I scratched my head for a bit.  What now?  I pressed delete and closed the delete menu, so had to do everything all over again.  Finally it dawned on me.no...press the shutter button?  Yep.  Now that was not even remotely intuitive.  Not only does it double as the zoom, but it is on a different surface of the camera.Im a human factors engineer and considered keeping this camera as an example of massive mistakes, to share with my colleagues.  But then I thought this is an expensive example and decided to return it.PLUS SIDE:If you decide you want to risk it the seller has a 30-day return policy and they are accepting it back for a refund.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10JRIDECWV4FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G58WOO#wasThisHelpful","R10JRIDECWV4FI","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this despite mixed reviews.  This is a solid cheese board.  Nicely laminated.Loved the deep curved cracker wells.  Liked the way the board looked.However the drawer for the tools did not fit as well as it could.  No room to correct it.  The wood matched perfectly.Tools seemed okay.  All were sharp enough.The cheese board flat area inside the wells measures 8- x 8-Most people who saw it, said: Cool, thats a neat idea, that was just when they saw the cracker wells.  When they saw the drawer for the tools, then they were impressed.  For the most part, they did not notice the poor drawer fit.  However that was the first thing I saw when I got this board out of its box.  Only time will tell if the laminate holds well.First thing I did;  when I received it, was give it a nice coat of mineral oil.Im posting a picture so you can see the drawer issue I mentioned above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZLRTAILJ5KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RC7C2Q#wasThisHelpful","R27ZLRTAILJ5KN","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy to read, hard to put down at times.  Mr. Lynch; Dermot, father to Eamonn travels to Spain to visit his ex-pat son.  He is surprised by his sons situation,  as he was under the impression all was well.  Eamonn surprised by his fathers visit is struggling on all fronts.  He moved to Spain to escape from himself and the isolation it provides makes it quite evident, this has become a prison not an escape.There is a lot of back and forth with Eamonns as well as Dermots memories.  One thing I thought they captured well was Eamonns getting to know his Dad separate from his Mom. So often the parents we know are a product of them being together.  We forget they might have a part of who they are suppressed by being a couple.  Another is when Dermot realizes that many years ago, he deserted his younger brother.  At some point, he realizes this sensitive soul is kin to his only son and there is a chance for redemption.As far as the shocking secret, rather underwhelming and besides the point of the story.  Conceptually it may be a metaphor, but it could have been skipped with little lost.The more I read of Eamonn, the more I realized his issues.  He was overly sensitive in some cases and oblivious in others. In other words his own worst enemy at times.  Arent we all?I particularly liked the ending.  I wasnt quite sure how they would wrap this up (Nope, not going to tell you), but it was perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FULKP019PADB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091815#wasThisHelpful","R3FULKP019PADB","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having a sealer already, this was nothing new, however this new sealer is a bit more expensive model than we had and has a few extra features. We had a seal a meal brand sealer before this.  One thing it did not do was store the roll of bag material.  That's a nice touch. There is also an extended length seal. This can come in handy with delicate or moist items.We have frozen a bunch of things and it worked well.  This is one of those items that needs more long term use than 30 days allows.  I will write more as we use it more.If you don't have a sealer, here's some thought as to why you might get one.We purchase some sausage from a butcher that does some unique combinations.  It's hours away from our home.  For the most part, we buy it in anything from 2 to 5 pound increments.  Sausage freezes really well, so when we get some, we get a lot and freeze most of it.  Using the vacuum sealer, it avoids freezer burn and when we defrost it, it is like the day it was frozen.Similarly, we buy some specialty cheeses.  No we don't freeze those, but when we have some we eat it in smaller increments than we buy it.  We vacuum seal it and keep it in the fridge.  This extends items from weeks, to months.I grow herbs and invariably, I find I use Thyme more in the winter than the summer, so I freeze sticks of it in individual usable sizes.  Voila, fresh herbs all winter.  Not all herbs can be frozen this way, but I have had good luck with Thyme and Rosemary.  I freeze Basil chopped in ice cubes.We had a seal a meal brand sealer before this.  One thing it did not do was store the roll of bag material or have the extended seal.  Also in using the seal a meal we were oblivious to some cheaper bagging material out there.  Using a sealer that's not affliated with a particular bag type put us on to some new sources of bags.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PYDWMY7CHS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUAK39A#wasThisHelpful","R14PYDWMY7CHS9","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We opted to get this router, not because our old one was broken, but we wondered if we could get better performance.  Occasionally our old one also a Linksys would cut out and we would have to turn it off and on.  Not enough to be annoying, but certainly more than it did when it was new.Getting the new one we were first surprised about it's size. It was 1.5X the size of the other and barely fit on the shelf we had the old one on. Also it had 4 antennas to our prior one's 2, so ideally it has a more omnidirectional reach.  Initial installation of the equipment and the SW went relatively seamless.  I had the initial case where you can't reach the internet and it told me to take a step to resolve this.  It did.  We thought we were off to fair skies.Prior to the installation we measured our internet speed on our old router and even directly from our modem, Essentially they were equal.  So we realized this new router could not offer more in speed and were hoping maybe reliability were to be gained.  Unfortunately our hopes were dashed early on.  First, we lost a connection a few times and used their fix in the SW.  Then we could not get the SW to work.  Finally we could not get the router to communicate with the modem at all.  We swapped back to our old router and all was good.  Over the course of a weekend, we changed the two routers out multiple times to no avail.Finally we opted to call customer service as several reviews had customer reps saying to do this.  To give the router a fair shake we did this.  First of all the number on the CD sleeve was utterly bogus and hooked us up to a direct sales site.  We ended up looking up a number on the internet and then successfully contacted Linksys.  After 2 hours talking to the service rep in the Philippines (a young woman with a very pleasant almost French accent, who spoke English very well), she concluded that the unit itself was faulty and though this is a Vine product (free), they would replace it, if we paid for the shipping.Jump forward a few weeks later, we dropped the new router in, where the old one was.  Installation since we wanted to use the same sign-in's took a bit of finagling on some devices, but was seamless on others, we now have a working router.  Given that the old one failed repeatedly the first night and it each subsequent use, this one has been working well in fact perfectly.4 or 5 days later...well, I thought it was working perfectly.  Unfortunately several days after I wrote that review, the new router, started acting like the prior one and no longer would work.  At this state, if it was not a ""Vine"" product, I would have returned it for my money back.  Ironically we returned to our older Linksys router that works perfectly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2ZBF6FIYEL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ19M72#wasThisHelpful","R2A2ZBF6FIYEL0","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read all the Sherlock Holmes books recently,  I approached this book with some trepidation. How could the author live up to the legend?  Well he does a passable job. While Athelney Jones and Frederick Chase are no Holmes and Watkins they make a great second string team.Some references to prior Sherlock Holmes capers are tucked in the book, in fact Athelney Jones was a police detective that botched prior investigations that Holmes solved.  However knowing the Holmes stories is not required to enjoy this book. When the references are made, they are for the most part explained.  This also helps if it has been awhile since you read the stories.One thing I do have to caution you, is that the first chapter is slow.  I was getting worried and then, it found its pace.  I think the author in trying to set up the book spent a bit too much time explaining. You were in the head of Frederick Chase as he pondered his next steps.  Finally when the two characters meet, the prose flows a bit better.  As with most Sherlock Holmes stories, the author has tucked in some unexplained issues and has created some significant twists.Overall a decent book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19XHX9Y3HXC99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062377183#wasThisHelpful","R19XHX9Y3HXC99","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once I started this book, I had a hard time putting it down.  I opted for this book as I find people's personal stories compelling, especially if the have made a major life change.  The author having moved from the Soviet Union, as some of my colleagues had, I was wondering how acclimating went.  I got a few chapters in and had the strangest sense that the voice was familiar.  The author used the word: vranyo. (a sort of lying to others and oneself about the state of things).  I realized I had read the author's first book before she left the Soviet Union back in 2009 and was hoping she continued her story.  What struck me then and now, is her descriptions of things around her and assessment of people's motivations and understanding.  She has a sharp eye and a very descriptive tongue.  She also noted, that we here in the US have a bit of vranyo of our own.I cannot imagine how difficult her time with no guidance in Texas was.  It always amazes me when an immigrant as she; thinks not knowing something is a personal failure.  Lack of knowledge should never be apologized for, unless the person had the opportunity to get this information.  How would you know, the food, the clothing, or the paperwork without being exposed to it?Later her Mother joins her and any woman with a Mom knows, the acclimation to your Mother living with you after you have lived on your own, is the really hard part, all cultural differences aside. Her sister joins her sometime later and she wisely observes that she moved away not only from Russia, but from them as well and now here she was in the same position again.I cannot imagine picking up and leaving my country, nor could I imagine doing so for one that is so foreign, especially considering all the propaganda indicating the harshness of the situation. Furthermore due to the political situation, she was  under the impression she might never be able to go back to visit.  Thankfully she was wrong and has had the opportunity to see her family and friends again.This is a very well written and entertaining book giving a glimpse from a natives eyes into a country, that always pretended to be equal to the US, but was far from that.  Once you read this, I don't think you will take our country for granted any more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R373FM1CAC680B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451689829#wasThisHelpful","R373FM1CAC680B","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im sure some people might think, oh another Eat, Pray, Love. They might think so, but I think this book offers a unique perspective.  Each chapter has a lesson and they are quite interestingly handled.  It is also less about travel and finding oneself, and more about exploring the self, by letting go of our environmental issues such as culture, possessions and treating people and all life with reverence.  Less about choices and control and more about flow.I liked the chapter on breathing and story of the demon. As a person that struggles with meditating, that one really hits home. Never thought of following your breath as busywork before.Since the author has married a local man, it would seem to have furthered her insight.  Often when we see things our interpretation is from our world view and not what is intended.  I find the perspective interesting. She reveals her American ignorance and Western mindset on many occasions as I think many of us would.  Thats all we have to work with.Knowing nothing of Bhutan, it seems like it is a hard isolated life. Often that is found hand in hand with a very spiritual mindset. The author has captured the flavor of all this in her chapters:Calm downLose your baggageLearn to BreatheRusticateDrink TeaKindness will save usIts okay to be who you areLaugh in the face of DeathGenerosity is ContagiousWalk in Sacred PlacesParent YourselfYou are what you eatMore to the middle in all thingsThere are no accidentsLearn to be waterDont expect everything to always work outThink about death 5 times a daySimple is GeniusLook for MagicSee the world with your heartCheck your EgoWake up","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URZ3CETUHM3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945090#wasThisHelpful","R2URZ3CETUHM3P","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book grabs you and drags you into the world, of Raney, Bo and Charlotte.  The story skips back and forth between what is clearly an older time and current day, where the doctor Charlotte has a mysterious Jane Doe in her ICU.  No one knows this womans story and she is not reported as missing.  What could have possibly happened to this poor woman with such severe injuries? In the meantime the doctor; Charlotte, is in a relationship, that she feels has stalled.  Shes content where she is, as she is unsure of what she wants.  However she knows at some point in time, she has to critically decide what is next.  The clock is ticking.The other story, initially you dont know who it is about, but assume it is the Jane Doe and is of a childhood time where bonds are formed between children and circumstances influence choices. Two children Raney and Bo meet and grow closer over several shared summers.  It is clear Bo has a fractured family life and that is one of the reasons he is in Raneys town in the summer. However it is not evident what his role will be in her future.The story is told back and forth from the present to the past and evolves and reveals itself in slow motion. I like the way, the author has left it to the reader to make a few leaps before they reveal what is going on.  Makes you feel smart.  Always a good thing. She also alluded to things without going into too much detail, like a car crash in Mexico. It was a peripheral story, but led credence to the horror the character involved felt.I enjoyed the character development and personalities. Each persons voice was strong and consistent.  You could see their motivation and understood their decisions, even if they were not the best ones at the time.I highly recommend this book and I will look up the authors other books, as she has a nice way of telling a story.  I felt the medicine discussed was the right level for the book (after all the author is a doctor) and not overly dominating the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MD4XIU5MJ2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451627939#wasThisHelpful","R34MD4XIU5MJ2M","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When they say comfortable chair....I'm in.  I can vouch that the chair is comfortable.ASSEMBLY:You get a relatively small box, for a chair and there are 5 main parts.  The chair pad, the 2 long legs the two short legs.  First you align the two sets of legs with their corresponding length legs and then you bolt both sets together, trust me, easier than I'm making it sound.  Flipping this over, you slide the chair pad onto these legs.  One person can do it, but two make it smoother.  Assembly from opening the box to sitting in the chair took about 15 minutes.  The longest part was unwrapping the plastic.  The second longest part was fastening the 8 screws.The only tool you need; the allen wrench, was provided.  Though the assembly went well, only 1 washer was extra.  Would have liked it if a spare screw was also provided.  You never know.USAGE:This chair is quite comfortable.  The sling design, puts little pressure anywhere.  However the lack of arms may make it hard for some people to get in and out of.  My knees are my weak spot and this chair while comfortable is not the easiest to get up out of.  However I noted it is not lower than my other living room chairs, so it's height is not an issue.  Though it does not put any pressure on the back of my legs, I felt, it was a short chair.  Instead of supporting my legs nearly to my knee (I'm 5'9""), this fell short about 5-6"".  For a living room chair that seems short.The slight back angle made this chair somewhat reclining, so this made me think I had to rest my arms down, but without armrests, they would be in my lap.  Also it made me want to put my feet up, versus leaving my feet on the floor.  Might be unique to me though.FABRIC;From the first moment after it was assembled, one of our cats decided it was his.  The smooth soft fabric attracted him over our leather cover chairs.  Considering the finish of the fabric, it should also be easy to clean. Thankful for that, as he is an orange cat and the fabric is sand.LEGS:The  chair legs are solid and do not easily bend.  They were well wrapped so the surfaces when they arrived are pristine.  Seem to be quite durable.OVERALL:Looking at the price relative to what you get, I thought this was pricey.  However it is well made and quite moveable, there the price is justified.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EF7KHANQJVW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4S2A1O#wasThisHelpful","R1EF7KHANQJVW8","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read Atul Gawandes books before, I opted for this one for more than just good reading.  I have a Mom in a nursing home and she has dementia. Thankfully she is not aware of the shear boredom I see around her.  Prior she was in an independent living environment full of activities and socialization around the dining room table. I mention this being fully aware that as a member of the baby boomer generation, we will become seniors in droves.  Some of us will live independently well into advanced age and pass away on our own terms but, a large group of us will end up in nursing homes or something similar, as our ailments increase with age.  This also pertains to those of us who have catastrophic accidents and illnesses that can no longer take care of themselves and neither can family. What sort of life will we have? The author brings up several examples where people have created homes for those who dont want to be warehoused and regimented and they were very successful.  Sadly though, they are very much the minority.The other perplexing dilemma is how ready is the medical establishment to help care for elders in fragile health or in an end stage of a disease, versus another person who has some likelihood of seeing the other side of this situation.  Do you cause harm and angst for 3 months only to have the person live out their already limited existence in considerable pain or recovery from surgery, that hampers their life. Or do you allow nature to progress and keep the person comfortable for the duration they have left and beyond and let death happen naturally.  Unfortunately doctors are not trained for this scenario.  Doctors often opt to treat when treatment obscures what is left of a persons life, so that more of this limited time is spent recovering, than living.  This is not only true for the elderly, but for people with a very limited or no chance of survival.  Unfortunately, not treating and letting nature take its course is seen as giving up and is so counter to our culture that it is perceived as a failure.The author discusses a very personal family situation where his father, was faced with some heavy choices, that due to his nature as a doctor, might be inclined to pursue aggressively, but instead considered of the potential outcome relative to his lifestyle and what was important to him.  In discussing this: He also pointed out there are 3 types of doctors, the authoritarian doctor of old, the informative doctor that just gives you the info and you choose and the cooperative doctor, that helps you consider the implications relative to what is important to you.  Unfortunately the cooperative doctor is hard to find and in the authors experience can seem this way, when actually being authoritarian.  Scary, as he and his father are both doctors and were swayed.  How is the average person going to first of all discern the difference or get the respect of the doctor to consider the patient well informed enough to make these choices?  In my own experience (a rather day to day one), after a minor injury to my wrist, during yoga, my own doctors solution was to stop doing yoga (permanently) as a treatment.  Considering the temporary nature of the injury and the long term advantage of doing yoga, these seems like a very short-sighted solution.  However this is not uncommon.  She neither asked the importance of this activity to me, nor seemed to care.  I badgered for physical therapy to strengthen my wrist (as she was not forthcoming) and this resolved the issue.  Frightening how little credence is given to what is important to us.Finally there is planning for the end and hard questions.  People just dont want to talk about it.I know I was taken aback when entering my Mom into  a nursing home, I was asked about funeral homes and plans upon death as well as DNR papers, but it would see we all want to think we will live forever, even when faced with a terminal situation.  The author pointed out that while doctors were thinking in terms of 3-6 month survival often their patients were imagining 10-20 years. It shows how way off we are and how insufficiently this is relayed.  If a doctor tells you to have surgery to give you 6 months more of life and you had only 2 months prior, you might spend 4 of those months recovering, with no quality of life and nearer to the end, what is left may not be worth living, that essentially he just took those 2 months away from you.  The patient acquiesces because they are imaging 6 months added to 1-2 years.This book is an eye opener on how to plan for your final days, what to consider and what to ask.  It will also help you understand what you may be faced with with an aging loved one.Most people wont plan for their less than independent years, so likely someone else will do that for you.  If nothing else, you need to make them aware what is important to you.  We also need to realize, that acceptance is harder than resistance in some cases as we may well be fighting the system as well.I hope this book gets the attention it deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGEM4WH7CIX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805095152#wasThisHelpful","RQGEM4WH7CIX5","A3S87ZOPB3UM9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S87ZOPB3UM9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is only a rectangle piece of glass.Also looking at my pictures of the bulb on the counter you can see the housing is slightly warped.This makes a huge difference in my picture quality.My housing is PLASTIC.  The housing for my Toshiba bulb is metal, and the picture shows a metal housing.This is a blatant misrepresentation of what was supposed to be sold to me.I wasn't expecting a bulb that would last a lifetime.... but I was at least expecting what was shown....bad business practice to dupe buyer....

" 0:56 Mins I am very disappointed with these.  My husband used these for 3 mos.  2 mos as a Union Laborer and 1 month as a Union Ironworker.They stained all his socks maroon.They aren't made in the USA anymore and the quality has gone DOWN without getting a price break.My husband was in desperate need of new boots.I bought them almost 4 months to the day as I'm writing this post.They took a week to get to me.Take another week for him to get a day off so he could lace them and stuff.So 3 and a half months and they are DESTROYEDThe leather isn't cut properly. So some of the leather was folded under and sewn instead of trimmed.They took quite a while to break in.  Due to the bulges in the leather, they were very uncomfortable.We couldn't ship them back and wait for new boots.At this point we needed boots like ASAP, even if they were crap.These boots used to be for Union by Union.I am disappointed that the quality has gone so far downhill since they have started making these overseas.The QC is obviously sleeping on the job also.We will be trying a different brand of boots.  Some of the other Ironworkers have had to move to a different brand since the quality has gone downhill while the price has stayed mainly the same or gone up.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZW31QFJQEQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002963JYM#wasThisHelpful","R3TZW31QFJQEQB","A1MGZ39KESOGD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MGZ39KESOGD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received my SCCPVS600ECP-S Crock-Pot and initial impressions were that it is a nice stainless exterior, but the only item with any ""heft"" was the black interior pot. Both the external pot and controls feel very flimsy and do not extrude a feeling of substance. The lid lock anchors are also plastic, with the only metal bits being the actual wire hinges. Having said that, when the lid is locked down, it does feel very secure and you don't feel too worried about it coming undone, even when the crock is full of dinner.I guess I was lucky because out of the box, this crock worked just fine and I followed the basic Slow Cooker Revolution recipe for Beef Stew and it came out as expected.  The pot does seem to have a pretty central hot spot though - my old Crock-Pot brand crockpots seemed to dissipate heat better than this guy did, not sure if they've changed the interior pot within the last five years or so.  The control panel feels really flimsy though, and I'm not sure how long it'll last, especially compared to my old pot which just had the generic dials.All-in-all, it sure is a crockpot. I'm not really sure if the timer function of the pot is really worth the extra cost though - especially considering that you can sometimes pick up a non-digital version for $30 or less.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UAFC3VILJS83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011L1VOTM#wasThisHelpful","R2UAFC3VILJS83","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Carhartt Force Vneck in Burnt Coral Heather.  I own quite a few other Carhartt Force shirts, mostly from their polo line. First impressions is that unlike most of the other Carhartts I own, this shirt actually feels smaller than I'd expect (I received a large and usually wear a medium/large). The large was actually already snug in the arms and the body.  Usually Carhartts are sized up compared to other brands - a L feeling more like a XL, but this wasn't the case here - I'd say that the L felt like a true L, maybe even a larger M. However the material is rather stretchy and I believe this shirt is made to feel like it's hugging the body, so if you're buying expecting a loose fitting Carhartt, this isn't the shirt for you.The second impression was that the material is pretty thin, again, especially for a Carhartt. This shirt feels much more like their fashion line rather than their work line. If you're doing a lot of rough and tumble work, I'd really worry about the longevity. My old Carhartt Women's Short-Sleeve Pocket T-shirts felt like they could be run over by a lawnmower several times a day and come out in one piece. This shirt doesn't make me feel confident about its longevity - but I'll update either way and since I don't have proof either way yet, this didn't affect my review here, other than for the feel of the fabric.Colorwise, the burnt coral heather is like a faded bubblegum pink, with a slight tinge of orange added. I'd almost call it a salmon mousse color. It's not bright enough that it'll draw a lot attention for being loud, but it's also rich enough that it looks very feminine.The v-neck isn't super deep so I'd say that this shirt is probably ok for most casual work environments. The side scoops plus stretchy material hug the body help make any female curves obvious. When sized, the shirt does not hug your ""bad curves"" too badly.  Broad-shouldered women might find the arm area a little tight though.One small annoyance - the material tag is along the left side of the shirt, near the waist. I'm not sure if I just got super unlucky, but mine was poking me every chance it got. The material tag is by far the stiffest material on this whole shirt.  Next time Carhartt, please go tagless!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22X1IJ2XM8VBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8HN6LC#wasThisHelpful","R22X1IJ2XM8VBU","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Acanthus Ruffle Floral Kitchen Apron in the Floral Taupe color, and build wise, everything seems pretty solid. The main body of the apron - the non-frilly areas, feel solid without feeling overly stiff or heavy.  The frilly areas are much softer, but still do not feel thin or fragile. The neck and waist straps are very adjustable and can accommodate many sizes of people.  For me, the frill area seems a little overly frilly - I much prefer my other apron, the DII 100% Cotton, Professional Bib Apron, but this one obviously has the feminine thing going for it.The central pocket is cut in two, but neither pocket is very useful in my opinion.  You could probably put one pack of 3"" x 5"" index cards in each pocket, but not much else.

"I received this apron in black and so far so good.  The material is a thick-ish 100% cotton weave.  Out of the box, the apron felt somewhat stiff and starched - the straps felt somewhat itchy when first put on.  After an initial wash, the cotton settled in nicely and the stiffness went away. It did leech some color into the wash though, so for the first few washes, I'd suggest washing with separated colors only.If there was any shrinkage, it wasn't noticeable.The neck strap is adjustable and the waist ones are very long.

"The Everlast Nutrition Fuel is a nice on-the-go hydration option for those times you don't want to cart around a lot of sports drinks with you. As per the instructions, I put the powder into my water bottle and mixed. I generally hydrate while doing my workout so I don't really feel dehydrated, but it did seem like recover the next day was just slightly less stiff, slightly less sore. It wasn't night and day, but every little bit helps.The real gotcha is the taste. The citrus flavor is like an odd mix of Emergen-C, tang, and maybe even a watered down kool-aid without the sugar. The Fuel uses a stevia extract for a bit of sweetness though, so if you're like me and get that odd stevia bitter aftertaste, you'll probably dislike this stuff.  Instead of diving in head first and buying a full 14 count, I'd highly suggest trying a single packet if you can find it first. Drinking 14 of these isn't something I really want to do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YN0GJAWAGWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7YZ7IO#wasThisHelpful","R24YN0GJAWAGWG","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The La Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 AOX is a non comedogenic, silicone-based sunscreen and antioxidant serum which uses tocopherol (vit-E) as its antioxidant base.The serum spreads very well and a small amount will cover a large area - I could get a single pump to cover my entire face - albeit rather thinly. I'd guess that a 1 to 1.5 pumps is probably average. The serum goes on rather greasily and is not really pleasant feeling to apply. The greasy feel dissipated in a minute or so and left the skin feeling somewhat smoother (not as smooth as applying a moisturizer, but similar). With careful conservation, I'm guessing this single vial would probably last two or maybe even three months (assuming you are reapplying every two hours as directed while you're exposed to UV rays).There is no true scent associated to the serum other than a sort of faint and generic chemically smell when first applied. It didn't bother me much and seemed to go away within a few minutes.The serum also contains things like baicalensis root and cassia leaf extracts, both which are often used as antibac/antifungal and anti-inflammatory type medicines.The Anthelios 50 AOX is a decent sunscreen that goes on rather greasy, dries smoothly and does not have a noticeable scent afterwards. The non comedogenic aspects are great, especially since many sunscreens seem so heavy and clogging. However, there's quite a few chemicals included as well as being silicone based, which isn't exactly eco-friendly. If you have sensitive skin, this serum has quite a few glycols in the ingredients, so you may want to test it out before using all over your face.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP16QRFE6EYOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBJWR0M#wasThisHelpful","RP16QRFE6EYOU","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Menaji CAMO concealer is a good a general use concealer in a very convenient, easy to carry packaging. Having said that, the concealer is of a ticker mud-ish consistency which (depending on your skin tone) might require quite a bit of blending to not be obvious. While not specifically listed as non comedogenic, the concealer did not feel heavy or blocking when applied (although I wouldn't call it ""light"" either). If you have serious issues with breakouts due to pore blockage, you may want to find something specifically listed as non comedogenic instead of risking it. It is listed as hypoallergenic - I don't have sensitive skin, but I did not notice any reaction from use.I received the ""Light"" coloring and I would say that the description is pretty accurate. I generally have a light/medium skin tone and the concealer, once blended in, is a decent match. While not perfect, it's not painfully obvious that I'm wearing concealer either.  At the time of this review, this product was priced in the mid-twenties, making it a low-to-mid-ranged price for most concealers. When compared to similar brands, there are some really good names out there that - while not specifically marketed towards men - are awesome products. Personally I think I'd pick up a Nars, Make Up Forever, or Urban Decay instead. However this concealer performed decently well (but I'd still keep my Nars close at hand).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JBURL4IUB2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TW8EM6#wasThisHelpful","R30JBURL4IUB2Q","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ammex APFN blue nitrile gloves are a good general use glove and their light color is one of my favorite ones to use for food prep.

While I generally have to worry about punctures or rips with the generics, the Ammex gloves are very resilient and made it through some garage clean up with no issues.I generally wear a size M glove and these S I received were pretty tight on the hand.

"The Ammex GPNB GlovePlus nitrile gloves are a very nice and sturdy set of general use gloves.

"The recipe book that is Nuts is a good general look at various items you can do with nut meats - it covers all of your basics like roasting, boiling, making milk, butters, as well as general spice mixes, protein recipes, salad suggestions, as well as some desserts and even some cocktails. The book specifically covers your most easy to find nuts - Almond, Cashew, Chestnut, Hazelnut, Macadamia, Peanut, Pecan, Pine, Pistachio, and Walnuts (yes, it does cover the fact that peanuts are legumes).While the volume is a relatively short book - only 132 pages, it actually does cover quite a bit of ground. The recipes are easy to understand and well explained.  There's not a picture for every recipe (maybe closer to one in five or so), but the ones that are there are nicely presented.Since the volume does span from raw nuts to dessert and all courses in between, there's nothing that's specifically vegetarian or gluten free,  Having said that, the majority of the included recipes are quite healthy and many lean towards vegetarianism and gluten free options - you just have to avoid adding things like bacon to the salad, or skip the desserts with cake-ish subjects.  There's actually quite a bit to choose from for both specific requirements.All in all, I probably wouldn't suggest Nuts as a addition to small collector of cookbooks, simply because much of the subject matter is probably covered in general cookbooks, but if you're a cookbook collector like I am, it's not a bad volume to add.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S1MV0ZR74ZVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632170213#wasThisHelpful","R2S1MV0ZR74ZVH","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Braven Wireless Speaker is joining a large line up of bluetooth speakers and it performs relatively well when compared to others in the same price range.The speaker pairs easily and had a relatively loud volume, considering its size. It will be loud enough for a small outdoor gathering, but probably not for anything larger than five or more people in a small to medium sized backyard space. Like most bluetooth speakers, it paired easily with my phone (Note 3).The Balance has a 4000 MAh battery, and it doubles as a portable battery for any mobile devices, the USB output jack rated at 5V / 1A. For whatever reason, Braven decided not to allow USB charging for the speaker itself - you've got to drag along the AC adapter should you want to charge the speaker on the road. According to the manual, a single charge will provide you with 18hrs of music before requiring a recharge (less if you use the BOOST feature).  The Balance also has a discrete battery charge indicator in the back, so you can get an idea of how much power is left in the speaker - a nice little addition that's often left off of cordless devices nowadays.  The IPX7 waterproof rating suggests that the device is able to be put into 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes and still function - however the manual specifically states that the device should not be exposed to liquids while charging.All in all this speaker is a decent addition to the line of up speakers posted at the $100-$150 range. Sound wise, as expected of a speaker with a shallow body, there's not much depth of sound or chest-thumping bass, but the highs and mids are decently defined. The inclusion of a waterproofing makes it much more outdoor-friendly than many of the other bluetooth options out there, however the AC adapter requirement for recharging is a minus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BH2QFV5A864U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKTKWOU#wasThisHelpful","R2BH2QFV5A864U","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Video game art books tend to stray towards a couple basic types. There are collaboration ones which take a shotgun approach by hitting several titles, and there are title specific books which give you both concept art and finished cinematic still frame type art. Game Art: Art from 40 Video Games and Interviews with Their Creators takes the first approach.For me, this really makes the book feel more like a collection of snapshots rather than any sort of in-depth view into video games or video game art. The interviews with the game developers is a nice touch, but even then, the amount of insight is small - each interview probably consisting of less than two full pages worth of text. While the book is filled with very beautiful glossy pictures of games, quite a few of the pieces are publicity photos. Final Fantasy is probably one of the more well-known franchises in this book, and quite a few of the images in the FF spread are directly from their promotional library. For instance, the giant splash page image of characters riding chocobos is lifted directly from the Final Fantasy XIV image catalog and very easily found online (search: final fantasy xiv chocobo).  Out of curiosity, I did a few Google searches on some of the smaller indie titles (Tengami, Child of Light, and Never Alone) and found that most of the art in this book could be found on the first page of image search results. Also worth mentioning was that most of the images Japanese games (specifically the JRPGs) other than Final Fantasy were not actual game art at all, but rather character or concept art. There are several pieces from the Atelier series but zero actual in-game photographs - only concept art.So to summarize, most of the images in this book are ""public"" photographs that you can easily find online by doing a simple image search for the relevant titles. The interviews with the creators and developers are a nice touch, but only surface interviews with very little substance - finding an interview with the creator done by a gaming site would probably give you more insight. The book itself is beautifully done. The colors and pictures are very sharp and the paper heavy and glossy. If you wanted a coffee table book about game art, or just a nice compact collection of general game art information, this is a good book to pick up.If you were hoping for a real ""Game Art"" book which lots of different images from games that can't be found anywhere else, this is not the book to grab. There have been a couple of books done about video game art and they tend to pale in comparison to title specific or studio specific books. If you were looking for a book on video game art, I'd suggest sticking with the more specific books for now, these shotgun approach titles just aren't up to par yet.Suggested titles to pick up instead:UDON's Art of Capcom: Complete EditionThe Art of The Last of Us and/or The Art of Naughty DogThe Legend of Zelda: Hyrule HistoriaAnd pretty much anything from a Japanese studio with the words ""Works"" or ""Complete Works"" in the title (example: Breath of Fire: Official Complete Works)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VS13SKH0BI4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593276656#wasThisHelpful","R1VS13SKH0BI4F","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The DermaFinish does feel a little heavy when applied, and while is listed for sensitive skin, does not specifically say it is non-comedogenic, so if you are prone to breakouts, this may not be the right choice for you.Tone-wise, I would say that the default ""nude"" color is a bit on the lighter side compared to other nude colors I've used.

Sabatier's ""Mother of Pearl 8 inch Chef Knife"" claims a few things, and I'll tackle them one at a time.  At the time of this review, this knife was priced at nearly $140 which puts it into the premium knives category in my opinion, and I'll treat it as such.(Faux) Mother of Pearl -Lets talk about this one first since it'll be the easiest. When most people think of ""Mother of Pearl,"" they think of nacre - that irridescent stuff that's usually on the inside of an oyster or clam shell. As the name implies, it's also the stuff that makes up the layers of pearls. What is on the Sabatier handle is *not* mother of pearl. It's ""pearlized"" - as in, it's sparkly. What is it actually made of?  Plexiglass. Or, by a more common name: acryllic. Some acryllic can handle even commercial dishwasher temperatures, however since Sabatier lists on the product page to handwash, I assume theirs is not one of these, which generally means their handle material is going to end up being less resillient. Not an issue if you're pretty delicate with your knives. If you're rough with them, expect some scratches and maybe even color clouding in time.(Not) High Carbon Steel -Do a search on X50CrMoV15 and you'll find that it has around 0.5% carbon content (and it's a German-based steel, not French) - which is less carbon content than your generic 440 stainless steel - the stuff that makes up some of the cheaper budget knives. To put this into perspective, this is the same steel that's in the best selling Victorinox Fibrox line - the ones that cost about a fifth of this knife. For knives that will see heavy use, the X50CrMoV15 is a relatively soft steel that will need frequent sharpening (2-3 months versus 6-8 for harder steels, very dependant on usage obviously). Honing is almost a requirement before every use. On the flip side, this knife will probably stay very shiny and be very scratch resistant. Toss your knife into the sink and leave it there after every use? This knife can take that sort of abuse.(Never trust a skinny) Chef Knife -I've uploaded a picture of this knife next to some of my other chef knives. What was immediately obvious upon opening the package was that the Sabatier was extremely thin as far as blade width was concerned. The only knife I owned that even came close to that thinness was my 6"" Shun. I'd almost call this more of a large utility knife, or a non-flexible boning knife than a chef knife. The second thing that was immediately obvious was the lack of a rocking edge. The blade shape was almost as flat on the main edge as my santoku - the rounded tip being the main reason why I wouldn't call it a santoku. The flat blade shape makes this knife more suited to an up/down chopping motion than a slice. If you're a ""rocker,"" you'll hate this knife.Here's the other kicker about the blade being so thin - there's hardly any knuckle clearance. I have what I'd consider normal sized hands - the Fibrox handles are on the edge of being too large to be comfortable. If you have giant gorilla hands, this knife will feel tiny, and you'll probably end up banging your knuckles constantly. I hated the feel of this blade in my hand and it took a while to figure out why - I was automatically adjusting my grip so that my two forward fingers were actually on the blade more than the handle in order to keep my knuckles from brushing the cutting board. When I purposefully tried to hold it normally - with a leader index finger, but the other three main fingers on the handle, the balance felt wrong, and my knuckles were hitting the board so often it felt like I was knocking on a door. Again, for gorila-handed people, the handle is very thin, similar in feel to that of a pairing knife. It felt pretty small even in my hands.Sabatier (What's in a name?) -Sabatier is a relatively generic French name which came into use before intellectual property and trademark laws existed. It used to mean high quality, fully-forged steel from Theirs, France. Now it's more of a generic term for ""French knife maker"", which can include anything from stamped knives or actual forged French knives. The fact that it was so hard to find the maker of these knives sent up warning bells as well. After some Googling, these particular Sabatier knives are made by the Rousselon brand (rousselon.fr), which has some really nice knives. However you'll notice that this ""Mother of Pearl"" line is not even mentioned on their website.Edge (Out of the box) -The edge out of the box was a good sharpness, able to cut through apples and tomatoes with little effort. The lack of weight behind the blade and lack of rocking edge made me feel that I needed to press on the head of the knife as well as the and handle in order to cut through the apple's core. The edge was fine enough that I was able to do paper-thin slices of the apple and tomato.Conclusion -Don't do it. This is a premium priced knife that has all the features of a budget knife. If you want a knife that looks nice sitting in a butcher block, but never gets used, a set of these would fit that bill nicely. However, for the price, there's so many better options out there. Many of which are probably cheaper.Recommended Knives (Note: All knives listed below were cheaper than the Sabatier at time of this review) -Victorinox Fibrox 8"" Chef's KnifeZwilling J.A.

"The OnHub Wireless Router is like a Fisher Price version of a router. I'd easily suggest setting this puppy up for those relatives who aren't really sure about technology. The device requires you link a Google account which is really the only oddball thing to me. I don't mind the requirement of passwording your network, I think everyone should do that by default - even for a guest network.If you like out of the box, ready to go type devices, this is a great router for you. However if you have an at home lab, specific subnet configs, or even band-specific networks, you'll have no luck with this device. As far as range goes, there's a reason why the newer high end routers all look like spiky porcupines, external antennas simply allow for stronger signal. I will say that for a unit with only internal antennas, the signal was surprisingly strong.I am curious if the Tomato folks will take on this router, it seems like it has a lot of potential. Or if the Google app will eventually keep evolving like the Amazon Echo and allow for advanced configuration options for ""power users"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FONYCZDSIFGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ALA9LA#wasThisHelpful","R1FONYCZDSIFGB","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to Advil vs Tylenol, Tylenol was usually my go to for fevers and the like, but it really didn't do much for my headaches. I usually had to go to Advil for relief. These Goody's powders had a very similar result for me.I have mild shoulder pain from time to time which usually leads to a stiff neck and to a headache if I don't notice what's happening in time.

It tasted like an artificial fruit juice drink - and that stupid sucralose taste felt like it coated my mouth and lingered forever. In Goody's favor, I seem to recall these tasting incredibly bitter as a child - there was zero bitterness in the Mixed Fruit Blast flavor and it was very easy to drink (if you can get past that fake-sugar flavor). The flavor reminded me of kid's medicine.Unfortunately as far as benefits go, for me it didn't work very well.

"I haven't been the best eater in the world and I know type 2 runs in my family, so I was always curious what my glucose readings would be. Yearly doctor visits clear me, but the little hypochondriac always likes to nag at me.I tested the BG5 with myself and my roommate - both on Android devices, the Note 3 and Note 5 (I had a Galaxy Tab 10, but the app was not compatible). If you go to iHealth's website, this looks like an Apple-only app. I was a bit stymied at first as there are zero iProducts in my home. And as far as I can tell, you cannot use this device without it first synching to some sort of supported device. So even if you turn on the reader, stick a strip in, put in a blood sample, the device just errors and tells you to connect to an app-enabled device first. For whatever reason, when I did a search on the Google Play store, the only hit I got was their MyVitals app (which will not work with this reader). I had to rind a random Youtube video which showed the person using an Android phone and figure out that the name of the app is the iHealth Gluco-Smart. Doing a search for that specific name brought it right up on the Play store (this was probably my fault, but hopefully it helps someone else out).It should be noted that the Gluco-Health app required a metric ton of permissions. The biggest ""Why?"" was that it has the ability to directly call phone numbers (not just read phone status). Most of the other permissions were pretty standard - take pictures/video, record audio, GPS location, modify SD card, prevent screen lock, WiFi access, Bluetooth access, reorder/retrieve running apps (another Why? one), run at startup (Why?), draw over other apps, allow Wifi Multicast, control flashlight/vibration, prevent from sleeping, change audio settings, modify system settings (Why?).Tethering the device was pretty simple for the first Android unit. It worked just as you'd expect - hit the pairing button, scan with your phone, and wait for the app to acknowledge the connection. Using the built in QR code scanner worked well, but it claimed that one of my vials of test strips was already expired (the date printed on the vials said it was good until 2016). Luckily my unit came with two vials of test strips and the other one read as good. The app also requires you to create an iHealth account before using.The lancet worked fine as expected, and the blood draw itself was very simple. It's always amazing how little blood these readers require nowadays. The reader said I had a glucose reading of 106 (I had eaten less than two hours ago). Looking online.t his seemed pretty normal. So I handed the device over to my roommate.Pairing with a second device was a little more questionable. By default, you're supposed to press the memory button for 3 seconds and wait for the bluetooth icon to blink - this should be pairing mode. When your phone connects, the bluetooth symbol is supposed to go solid to let you know the reader has successfully paired. This is how it worked with my phone. We had to try to pair the reader three times with the second phone before it took. The reader would show three dashes and the bluetooth symbol wouldn't stop blinking. The phone would claim that it has paired, but the app would stay stuck on ""Please connect device"". With some voodoo combination of restarting phones, unpairing from all existing phones, repairing with one phone, we finally got it working - unfortunately I can't tell you what the silver bullet was that made it start working correctly.My roommate, who had also eaten less than an hour ago, and had been drinking a rum-and-Coke style drink, tested at a glucose reading of 98. As far as I could tell from online sources, this was really low even for a fasting rate (he donates blood regularly and has not tested positive for high nor low blood sugar). This seemed like a really odd result, but didn't really have a good benchmark to compare it against nor another glucose reader to get a second opinion.I then saw all of the previous reviews of this device where the users had very drastic results from their other glucose readers and it made me question the validity of the results.  So I tried again in the morning, pre-breakfast - so after fasting 10hrs or so. First I put in the control solution - it registered at 116 (it was supposed to be around 100). So I did three tests in the morning, the first one read 25, so I'm assuming I managed to fudge that one up somehow. The second 85, the third 82.So for me, it's a bit of a crapshoot. I really wish I had another glucometer to test against to see if these readings are accurate.From a purely functional standpoint, the device is simple and easy to use. The app itself is a little on the clunky side with some questionable permissions. It's also a bit of a maze to find your individual readings (although it does do a neat graph chart). It's nice to have all that data directly on your phone, but a wider range of Android devices would be nice.  For diabetics, as long as you have a secondary unit which you trust to make sure that this reader is calibrated correctly, I can see this device being really handy. Test strip refills on the iHealth website seem cheap-to-average compared to what I can find for a similar count at local drugstores ($12.50 for 50 strips). They appear to be around $10 via Amazon Subscribe and Save right now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214KS1F0WKYNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1IRZTW#wasThisHelpful","R214KS1F0WKYNR","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So Fluxx is already a game of total chance - while you can make up possible strats in your head or even an idea for what cards you'll be playing your next turn, by the time your turn arrives, another player has probably blown that all out of the water. The Fluxx Dice doesn't really change that mechanic, all it really does is add the possibility that the number of cards played off the bat increases immediately. There's no real uniqueness though, all of the dice options already exist in all of the base games I've seen - the various Draw and Play X number of cards. It might have been a good addition if there were dice-specific actions, but there's not.These dice also are of questionable quality. Out of the box, there was obvious printer alignment issues as the text on my dice were a bit ""skippy"" and wavy. The black dice already had a few points where the paint chipped off parts of the text.  It makes me nervous that longevity might be an issue. Also since the Fluxx boxes are all relatively small, the dice will have to stay in the included box or a dice bag for storage purposes. If you're taking Fluxx to a friends, luckily they're a small package overall, but if you want to play with the Dice, you'll probably be taking two boxes (the base set and the dice).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEKIFTASZJGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NL056O#wasThisHelpful","RSEKIFTASZJGP","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dogs have loved the Wellness Wellbars for years and i'm glad to see this hasn't changed. The Wellbars are a hard treat - so if you have dogs with sensitive or weak teeth, these may not be the best treat - the hardness reminds me of the Nature's Valley granola bars for humans. They're also a bit on the messy side as they will crumb-it-up when the dogs break them apart. My dogs lick up the crumbs, but it may be  best for a non-carpeted, non-rug floor (unless you plan on vacuuming afterwards).Ingredient-wise, I love most of Wellness' stuff because they've got a pretty simple list, and the top ingredients are usually identifiable.  For the yogurt, apple, and banana flavor, here's the list:Ground Barley, Cane Molasses, Ground Brown Rice, Canola Oil, Yogurt (Milk Ingredients, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Yogurt Cultures), Apples, Bananas, Oatmeal, Flaxseed, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Vitamin E Supplement, Mixed Tocopherols added to preserve freshness, Beta-Carotene.As you can see, the second ingredient is molasses and the apple and banana come later. This suggests that there's probably a pretty decent sized serving of sugar per bar (unfortunately they don't break down how much per serving like in human foods). So these are very much a treat food which should only be given now and then.The size is large enough that my Malamute feels like she has to chew them and break them up, but my Shiba can still handle them without issue. They're wide enough that I think even most larger dogs will still feel the need to break these down, but smaller dogs may have a tough time without breaking the bars in half first.All-in-all, I'm very happy with the Wellbars and so are my pups!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QNV0DR6JC9RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002H3R2E#wasThisHelpful","R2QNV0DR6JC9RW","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Edit - According to AHAVA, triclosan is not in this product. It's always best to check your ingredient list if you're worried. It may be that I received a reformulation. Older tubes may still contain triclosan, so to be on the safe side, check before using.I have been using the AHAVA Dermud foot creme for a few days before I saw the Triclosan warning by another reviewer. Unfortunately the ingredients are not printed on the actual tube, but only on the original packaging box - which I had already thrown away at this point.When I checked on AHAVA's website for this product, Triclosan is *NOT* listed on the list of ingredients. I have sent their customer service an email inquiring if triclosan was recently removed, and if so, how to tell if the product I have was made in the batch with or without the chemical. I will update this review when I hear back from the company.Usewise, the creme was nice to use. The scent is a somewhat generic ""moisturizer"" smell, which no real heavy scent markers that really come to mind when I smell it. The feel of the lotion stays somewhat greasy for an extended time - upwards of five to ten minutes on a humid day - something I'm not really a fan of, but I understand is somewhat required in the heavily moisturizing products. I have rough patches on my heel and Achilles' tendon, and the product did help in those areas, but honestly I couldn't see a difference between this and something like CeraVe, which is my go-to moisturizer. Bang for the buck, I think I'll stick with my CeraVe, but the AHAVA did work well enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQHQXKRQ26ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","R3IQHQXKRQ26ZB","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oceanique Tribal Chevron shower curtain is a nice external shower curtain. It is a fabric material so it will not block water - so you do need a shower liner for use with this curtain. The holes for the curtain hooks were only double-stitched rather than metal grommets, but they seem to be holding up well and I found no loose threads during installation.The curtain I received seem a lot more saturated for the Tribal Chevron pattern than shown on the Amazon page.

"The Phillips HD3095 Multicooker is an interesting device that's probably best suited for a smaller kitchen which don't have a lot of room for an array of gadgets. For basic purposes, the Multicooker can act as a slow cooker, a steamer, a (partial) skillet, and a small oven. The footprint is similar to a larger rice cooker, and in fact, if I didn't know better, I would have assumed that that is what this was. If I put it side-by-side with my Zojirushi 10 cup micom rice cooker, they'd take up around the same amount of space on the countertop.Performance-wise, it's not a great leap forward. Much like how slow cookers are convenient but don't seem to quite capture the true taste of a long roast in the oven, the Phillips Multi-cooker is the same. Having said that, I feel it does everything ""well enough"", especially for the sheer number of appliances the unit is attempting to emulate. Although my rice cooker has a steamer function, it doesn't do slow cooking well. My slow cooker doesn't steam well, and definitely doesn't do anything along the lines of baking. Neither rice nor slow cooker are very good at any high heat browning or sauteing. This multi-cooker can handle all the above tasks relatively well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EU7TL0HYX55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R33EU7TL0HYX55","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The AHAVA Time to Hydrate Active Moisture Gel Cream is an interesting product which doesn't feel quite as hydrating as the name suggests. The scent is both noticeable but not overpowering. Oddly enough, the product does not specifically say that it is non-comedogenic, so people who are prone to pore blockage may want to steer clear, or do some spot testing first.""Gel cream"" is a perfect description for the consistency of the product. It goes on wetter than a cream, but heavier than just a gel. Even with quite a bit of working, the moisturizer stays wet/tacky for a while, making me think it's not a great daytime match. There's also no built-in SPF protection, so you'd have to apply something else on top. For those with sensitive skin and allergies, while there are no parabens, the ingredient list includes a lot of acids, enzymes, and alcohols, as well as quite a few other chemicals. So test on a small area first.Personally I felt that my L'Occitane brand moisturizers blended better and made my skin smoother.

"The Proactive+ Redness Relief Serum works well for spot treating occasional redness and is a great addition to your overall skincare regimen, however the refrigeration requirement firmly places it in a ""plan ahead"" category of usage. You can't really store this in your purse/bag and bring it out to use on the fly. The serum feels nice and cooling (both due to refrigeration as well as formulation) when applied and since it is non-comedogenic, it doesn't feel heavy on the skin (and it would be weird for a product from ProActive to block pores). This is another time I wish I could give things half stars, as the product works well as intended, but also has quite a few drawbacks.The serum worked well enough on my random flare-ups and it is a nice product to have around, but I wouldn't call it a necessity for your regular day-to-day skincare maintenance. While per-use quantity is very small, the price point of this product is very high, although I expect this one tube to last me more than a year (I do not see myself using it extremely regularly - the tube also says to use a max of 3x's a week).For those with sensitive skin or allergies, this serum is chock full of glycols, glycerines, oxides, and ethanols.

"Currently I have been welding with an older Jackson auto darkening helmet. The helmet works perfectly fine, it was just starting to show its age. I was not expecting to see much of a difference in performance with the Jackson WH40 but I was pleasantly mistaken.The field of view on the WH40 is very nice, it has a slightly larger lens than my previous helmet but it makes quite the difference when the mask is only a few inches from your face. The clarity is superb, unlike most masks I have used where when not welding the lens is still quite dark and inhibits your eye sight in poorly lit environments, this mask is not nearly as dim (while not welding). I am able to keep the mask on in between welds while working in my garage at night with bad lighting. The helmet is very light and fits comfortably on my head.The controls on the helmet are pretty straight forward. Press a setting button, it shows you that setting's level on the display, press the button again and it increases the level by 1. There are adjustments for sensitivity, shade, delay and a toggle mode for welding or grinding. It took me about a min to get the helmet adjusted to my liking. Just make an adjustment, strike a quick ark, rinse and repeat if necessary or move on to the next setting.Overall I think this is a fantastic welding helmet. It definitely surpasses my expectations for a helmet in this price range, and I enjoy welding with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N1L8JCAJZ4JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KW1GY4I#wasThisHelpful","R2N1L8JCAJZ4JT","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dr Infrared Heater 18 cuft system is a nice little compact system for roasting items you might have after taking a nice trip. My home is currently bedbug free and I'd like it to remain that way, so tossing not-easily-washable items is what this device is good for. While it's too small for your larger suitcases, it can fit most of your carry-on style bags (with some modification of the internal racks). The fan isn't whisper quiet, but it's also not jetliner loud, and it gets toasty pretty quickly, especially in the summer here in Texas where it's already warm out anyway.A nice little unit for peace of mind for small to medium sized items.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31V6F58W96RFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOUCYDW#wasThisHelpful","R31V6F58W96RFZ","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Belkin CAT 5E cable works as expected. The flat form factor is nice for traveling as it winds up nicer than traditional round cables. While shielded to the 5E specifications, it's not very bulky or stiff (especially when compared to CAT6~ cables). If you still need a wired cable for travel, this isn't a bad one to pick. It's also a good option for permanent installations as the flat cable is less intrusive behind furniture or under items.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y06EO1YTTHSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009V1IYMU#wasThisHelpful","R2Y06EO1YTTHSJ","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Belkin Wired Tablet Keyboard with Stand is a very specific function keyboard. It's got a pretty large foot print which doesn't make it very portable. The stand portion does not fold down and stays poking, making storage a challenge as well - the angle is also static, so no adjusting. The keys are a cheap scissor switch style which do not feel that great (if you're a keyboard snob like me). They feel worse than the default keys on many laptops - very reminiscent of those $15 keyboards you'd find in a big box office store.So everything about this keyboard is very mediocre, nothing stands out. So the question becomes, would it be better to have a case with kickstand and a plain wired keyboard instead?The immediate win for this keyboard is the all-in-one factor. All you'd need is a tablet (or phablet) and this keyboard and you're ready to go. No worrying about a case and keyboard or if your device has enough juice to connect via Bluetooth at the moment.For my tablets, I've already invested in cases that do weird origami in order to sit in a couple of different viewing positions. I also much prefer the feel of my Poker 3 Keyboard and am willing to deal with the size differential there for the benefit of the better typing feel. However, when I don't want to use that space, I still think my SHARKK Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard is still a better keyboard.Now, having said all that, if you need a static stand with a wired keyboard, this isn't a bad investment. It's just that the use scenarios are very specific. It might be good for a classroom lecture or for taking meeting notes for those instances when you don't have a laptop. This might also be an alternative for those non-technical family members who hate touchscreens and need a physical keyboard to write emails or even browse the internet on their tablets. For most people though, the case + keyboard combo will probably still remain more useful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z26Y64Y22CR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4L721S#wasThisHelpful","R1Z26Y64Y22CR7","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Elmer's Freestyle glasses holder is an interesting little accessory which isn't quite up to the Command Adhesive level of usefulness yet. When you receive the product, the first thing you'll notice is that the adhesive backing is about three times the size of the actual glasses holder. It also requires a perfectly smooth surface to adhere well. My walls are textured drywall and the adhesive was not happy about it. Even after letting it sit for a couple of hours before even adding the tray, it'd slowly fall off after a day or so. Putting it on a smooth surface - like the side of my fridge - worked out much better (but I didn't really need it there). If you are planning on wall mounting this tray and have smooth walls with a gloss or semi-gloss latex paint, it should be fine.  Wallpaper, textured, or matte finishes probably won't work well. I'd pick a Command tray over this one in a heartbeat, but if you have the perfect surface, it works well enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GBM0425SS6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G94D0#wasThisHelpful","R22GBM0425SS6H","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dyson V6 Mattress is another offering in their barrage of handheld units released for 2015. I believe it is by far the cheapest offering in their current line up. For the price, the biggest thing you're losing is the extension tube, which in my eyes really removes the functionality of this little unit to possibly act as a vacuum replacement for smaller homes/apartments. Without the extension tube, this is more or less a pure handheld vacuum only (unless you plan on getting on your hands and knees to vacuum your floors). For the cost, unless you absolutely need the motorized mattress tool, I would say that the Dyson V6 Cordless Vacuum is a better all-around purchase as far as bang-for-your-buck is concerned.Cost analysis out of the way, this is a great handheld comparable to all of the other current Dyson handheld offerings. I used the V6 Mattress on my Steelcase Leap Chair and it picked up about half a sugar packet's worth of gray dust. Running it over a velvet-ish chair which my Shiba uses as his window lookout picked up all the hair and accumulated dust with ease. I even did a little spot cleaning on the carpet and it worked great. Moving on to the mattress, an item of note - if you have any loose fabric covering the mattress, such as sheets or a mattress protector, the motorized head will stall out. The tool needs to be on a taut surface to work - so heavy comforters or quilts will be fine, otherwise you'll have to remove them before using the vacuum. Since I use a mattress protector and Tempurpedics have a closed-cell architecture, the vacuum did not pull a lot of dust out. When I used it on the guest bed which also had a protector but was a box spring design, it did pull out a bit more, but nothing awe-inspiring. Lesson here - buy a dust proof mattress protector.For curiosity, I broke out my old Dyson Mattress Tool and stuck it on my full-sized Animal upright. Even though the mattress tool isn't motorized, the canister motor is nearly twice as powerful (100AW vs 180AW) so it worked just as well if not better than the handheld. So if you already have an full-sized canister vac, you're better off picking up a mattress tool attachment in my opinion. The canister is obviously bulkier, but you don't have to worry about power. Speaking of power, running with the MAX setting along with the motorized head, I'd say you get around 10 minutes of full power before the vacuum starts to get a bit laggy. If you were curious, you cannot run the vacuum while it is plugged in.In the box, you get your standard Dyson attachments of the mini soft dusting brush, the crevice tool, and the combo-accessory tool. This unit did not include a wall mount. As with most of the handhelds, there's no real storage option for the other accessories. They don't snap onto the handheld unit and there's no real storage rest included.If I were to rate this unit as a standalone and pretending none of the other Dyson units were out there, I'd say it was a fine machine with powerful suction for a handheld unit. The charge is mediocre and probably wouldn't last you through a single thorough cleaning of a large (queen+) mattress, much less multiple mattresses without recharging. It is a great tool for doing spot cleans of mattresses and fabric-based furniture though. Since the unit does not have any sort of flexible tubing, it does make getting into tighter spots a bit more challenging since you basically have to be able to fit the entire unit where you want to clean.Since this is not the only handheld unit Dyson offers, I'd say that losing the extension tube really relegates this model to a role as a spot cleaner - which is fine if that's what you're looking for. However, unless the motorized mattress tool is an absolute must-have, the other models in the handheld line are probably a better option for people thinking about using this as their only vacuum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FX89ZLWXY2CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FQ4STC#wasThisHelpful","R1FX89ZLWXY2CB","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hello Kitty Trapper Keeper is your standard plastic style Trapper Keeper - basically a generic three ring binder with a closing flap. The rings use the generic snap enclosure, and there are pockets on each flap of the keeper, two in total. The pockets are made of the same thin plastic material that covers the inside of the binder. When I received the binder, it had been left outside in the Texas heat for a few hours already - the temps today reaching around 102 (it was probably 90ish in the shade when I picked up the package). Needless to say, the plastic was very malleable and the inside pocket was already slightly warped open. If you're planning on using this as a every day binder where it'll spend most of its time indoors in a locker, it should be ok, but I wouldn't consider it a good go-to for any hot weather (assuming you wanted to use the side pockets).The art is very cute and neatly printed, and the button enclosure snaps together nicely. However I can't see this justifying the exhortation price difference when compared to a simple generic 3-ring binder, or for the same price, I'd rather pick up a Five Star binder.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7UXLZLGI9Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NSJTG#wasThisHelpful","R2I7UXLZLGI9Z8","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know what you're getting yourself into when you get an Otterbox. It's almost like buying a Pelican case for your phone. It's big, it's clunky, but it's like putting a vault around your phone. These Defenders are the absolute archetypal examples of the big, clunky, phone case. In the case of the S6, it feels like you'r doubling - maybe getting close to tripling - the overall size of your phone. If you decide to use the belt holster, it's like being transported back to the 90's and having a two-way text pager on your belt.If I had a gripe about the Defender, it'd be how aggressively the holster holds on to the phone. I've actually ended up dropping my phone because of the pressure required to uncouple the phone from the holster. Needless to say, there wasn't a scratch on the phone thanks to the Defender, but it was still a pain. I tend to ignore the holster and just pop the phone with case in a pocket.The buttons work great, zero issues with the screen, and the case is a pain to put on for the first time, but after that, I have no qualms about performance. This thing is a tank and will protect your phone as well as you can probably ever expect a case to protect a phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ALB5AF1JW88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G9HH8#wasThisHelpful","R2ALB5AF1JW88","A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this GoPro accessory kit from Vanwalk in exchange for an honest review. I find it to be a great set of accessories for a GoPro camera, especially for the price Vanwalk is selling the kit for. Some of the stuff I this kit you might not need or use, but a couple items stand out. The chest and head strap are two of the most useful items. I cant compare them with the chest and head straps from GoPro, but these work just fine.The little tripod is sturdier than I thought it would be and is handy. The extendable selfie stick isnt as solid as the larger black ones with the clips like a tripod when extending it. But for a very small light stick, it is okay. The suction cup works, but I like one I have that has two suction cups a bit better.The floating hand grip will be handy when at the river or lake, and all the other accessories are good to have on hand just in case. (extra mounts, screws, wrench, etc.) I havent used them all yet, and might not even use some, but this is still a great accessory kit for the price they are selling it for.If you have a GoPro or similar camera, this is a value pack of accessories that will help you get the most out of your camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKD4IGKIBN2G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144DI2JE#wasThisHelpful","RKD4IGKIBN2G8","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sadly, RFID blocking sleeves are needed. There are people out there who will use technology to rip you off, and with the new RFID (Radio-frequency identification) readers, they can steal your credit card number, information on your passport, etc. without you even knowing it.While you may have never heard of RFID before, chances are you are using them right now. RFID chips are found in passports, credit cards, pet finders, transportation payments or easy-passes, hospitals, retail stores and a number of other areas where information is needed to be scanned quickly easily for identification.This information on these cards can be easily read via a $50 credit card reader picked up on eBay by just about anyone. The readers store your credit card number, expiration date and CCV number with a quick pass of your pocket or wallet. Criminals are now using technology to up the strength to increase the distance in which they can scan your card to ensure they have good standoff from the scene of the crime. Some reports are showing your cards can be scanned from 20-30' away.The good news is that you can protect your information and credit card numbers by using something to block the radio-frequency. While there are different wallets and cases available, RFID blocking sleeves are often the easiest, and allow you to continue to use your favorite wallet or purse.I was provided a set of these RFID Blocking Sleeves by RFID SECURE and find them to be an excellent safeguard for your credit cards and passports. The set comes with 10 credit card sleeves and two passport sleeves. Using these will prevent your chip containing cards to be read without you knowing about it.Passport RFID blocking sleeves: I tried the sleeves with my credit cards and passports and all of them fit snugly, but well. I had no problems putting cards in at all. The sleeves are sturdy and not as flimsy as some I've seen. These should last quite a while with regular use.Since I teach people to be safe for a living, I recommend these or some other form of RFID blocking protection. These sleeves are just one more layer towards keeping you and your belongings more safe.

"Spy Secrets That Can Save Your Life: A Former CIA Officer Reveals Safety and Survival Techniques to Keep You and Your Family Protected is a book by Jason Hanson, who has become more popular since appearing on ABC's Shark Tank and making a deal with Daymond John. Despite the CIA angle that is used for marketing, this book contains some solid advice on safety, security and survival.The book is written in a conversational style that is easy to understand and conveys information that most people really should know. I teach the same and similar information in my safety programs. The book is divided into these twelve chapters:One: Survival Intelligence. A good primer on being self-reliant and why you should know the information in this book. I really like that he points out that movement saves lives.Two: Situational Awareness. The cornerstone of staying safe, and Hanson bases his chapter on the classic color code of Col. Cooper. I liked that he also includes some pre-incident indicators and the concept of establishing a baseline.Three: Your Spy Escape And Evasion Kit. Good basic guide to gear to have on you, in your car, at your home, and ready to bug out.Four: Become An Escape Artist. This chapter teaches the basics to escape from rope, handcuffs, zip ties and duct tape. Also explains the basics of hot wiring a car, and how to break car windows. Very bare bones information on picking locks.Five: The Impenetrable Home. Strategies to criminal proof your home such as thinking like a criminal, delivery people, casing your own home, dogs, peepholes, doors, locks, alarms, lighting, windows, and so on.Six: Travel Safety. Tip to travel safe. These include when flying, taxis, hotels, and where you go.Seven: How To Run Countersurveillance Like a Pro. Most people are probably not being followed, but knowing how to tell if someone is following you and what to do it good to know. This chapter covers the basics regarding this topic.Eight: Social Engineering Secrets. I liked that he included this because it is important to understand to help keep yourself from being ripped off with scams, or being lured into something bad.Nine: How To Be A Human Lie Detector. This chapter examines some of the basic ways you can determine if someone is lying.Ten: How To Disappear Without A Trace. I like that Hanson points out that it is much more difficult to live off the grid and disappear than it used to be. With that said, he provides some tips for those that for some reason need to disappear.Eleven: The Art Of Survival Driving. Hanson teaches a survival driving course in Utah, and this chapter is an introduction to the topic with a few basics explained like the Reverse 180 and how to ram a car. Some good basic tips on being safe while driving also included.Twelve: Defending Yourself. Short chapter on what you can learn, with a plug for tactical pens which Hanson sells at his website. (I actually have a number of tactical pens, including the one Hanson sells, and it is a good pen for defensive purposes if needed.) Short chapter that gets you thinking about what you need to do in order to learn to defend yourself.Overall, I like the book because I am all for everything to help people live safer lives so they can enjoy the good stuff. It is a basic book, with resources out there that go more in depth on all the topics covered. However, it is nice to have all these basics in one volume, and then people can learn more on the topics they need to know more about for their lifestyle.It's a quick, easy read with some basic, practical information that will help people stay safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVAVSQMQJ1HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399175148#wasThisHelpful","R3QVAVSQMQJ1HC","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:42 Mins The anti-theft travel rucksacks and luggage from Numinous Packs are excellent for the security minded traveler. Designed with anti-theft technology, these packs help keep your belongings safe while traveling.I was provided a 65L pack to review and find it to be an excellent pack back. It encompasses the Numinous layered security system that consists of the anti-slash material that has Kevlar in it, the TSA approved zipper locks on the main compartment and the laptop compartment, anti-puncture zippers, and a cable lock so you can secure your pack to a fixed object.The security features of this pack add a little weight, but not enough to matter a lot. The website lists it at 3.5 KG or about 7.7 pounds. I don't find it that heavy. Here are the main features of this pack:Large main compartment with compression straps inside and that opens full length. This is very handy for this larger back pack in that you don't have to search way down inside the pack or dump everything out. The compression straps help keep things in place and also help protect the pack from over packing.Padded laptop compartment. This compartment also has zippered mesh pockets inside to hold thin items.Anti-puncture zippers and TSA approved zipper locks on both compartments. These zippers are harder puncture with pens, etc. Makes it harder to get into this bag when using the TSA approved locks, which you can change the combination, and TSA can open with their keys.Covers for zippers to conceal and protect them.Anti-slash material that has Kevlar in it which is much stronger than regular nylon material.Carrying handles on top and side that are strong and make it easy to pick up the pack.Padded back pack straps and belt that hide away under flap. These are adjustable to ensure a good fit regardless your size.Mesh pockets inside and on side of pack.

"These ZIG Whey Protein Portable Shake packets are convenient, but not the best tasting protein powder I've used. With that said, I usually mix protein powders with milk at home, and with these I mixed with water when out and away from a refrigerator and milk.I didn't they tasted bad, but not as good as others. I should also point out that it mixes very well with water. There is a thing inside called a mixing mesh that is supposed to help, and I guess it does because it does mix well. This is just a protein drink that provides 20g of protein and has 140 calories. It is not a meal replacement and doesn't contain other vitamins and minerals, which I actually like. I like protein powders that are just protein.The worst thing about this product is that it is an awful lot of packaging for a small amount of protein powder. You have a box and the six plastic shaking containers. So you are paying for packaging and the convenience of being able to take a pack with you and mix with water wherever you happen to be. So if you need the one serving pouches that you can take with you, this is a good product if you don't mind paying extra for that convenience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CP8S8UP1JT56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJGFRWE#wasThisHelpful","R2CP8S8UP1JT56","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using these gloves by Ring Side without wraps to workout with my 100 pound heavy bag, and like them just fine. They have a snug fit and protect my hands during workouts. I like the Velcro wrist strap that secures them, as these newer gloves with Velcro are so much easier than my old pairs with laces. These wrist straps tighten up well and stay secure when punching.The injected molded foam really does seem to allow more absorption of shock than the older style gloves. Since they are still fairly new, the shape and padding are still just right, but I expect them to be durable and good for many work outs.The leather striking surface, molded foam, and perforated palm to keep hands cool and dry (Sort of, if you are sweating a lot, this helps, but doesn't eliminate your hands being wet, and you still need to dry out and air out the gloves) all make these a great pair of gloves work heavy bag workouts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RF2SBSGPZU14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVUZUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2RF2SBSGPZU14","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sons of Anarchy board game Men of Mayhem is a cool game for fans of the show. In this day of video gaming, it's still nice to get with some friends to play a board game. The game is recommended for ages 13+ and you play with 3-4 players.Players take on the roles of different clubs: Mayans, One-Niners, Lin Syndicate and SAMCRO. As the subtitle states, the game is about money, guns, and violent consequences.  You want to occupy key locations and exploit profitable opportunities. Along the way you can bribe, threaten and bargain with rival clubs. If that fails, violence is always an option. Just do so without going to jail.At first you need to pay attention to the rules, but they aren't too hard or complicated to master. You just have to pay attention until you get the hang of it. There is enough variety and the way you play to keep future games different. And as you play, you learn strategies that will help you win.Fans of the show who enjoy board games will certainly like this game. Might fight over who gets to be witch club though. Those not familiar with the show may still enjoy it, but not quite the same as those who know the characters, clubs and such. Fun board game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10JGS5QPHI5YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940825237#wasThisHelpful","R10JGS5QPHI5YO","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Legacy of the Bear: Book 1 of the Berserker's Saga by J.P. Ribner took me back to the science fiction and fantasy reading that I enjoyed when younger. I hadn't read a book in this genre for a long time, and I enjoyed this tale of coming to manhood in a land of warriors of Norse times. I'll get this out of the way up front, I don't like the cover. On the cover alone, I may not have read this book. So, don't let it cause you to pass this one by. While I don't like the cover, I did enjoy the read.The story is simple, but well told. It's the journey of a young warrior on his quest to become the warrior, or berserker, that his father was. He has to prove to others, but more importantly, prove to himself that he deserves the title of Berserker. To be worthy, he must face his inner demons as well as the external forces set to stop him. There are advisers to assist him, a love interest to temp him, and the villains to test him. All of which make it a good book.I found myself enjoying the story and caring about the characters. It was a fun and exciting read that was fast paced and kept me turning pages. Near the end, you are introduced to what lays ahead in the next books. And yes, while this adventure concluded, there is much more to come and you have to read the next book to see what happens next. (And Ribner does a good job of making you want to know what happens next.)Overall, if you are a fan of this genre, this is a quick read that you'll enjoy and want to continue to see where the story leads. Well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDEXRYE8RW6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478196130#wasThisHelpful","R2CDEXRYE8RW6P","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Epson printer, as I've owned HP and Cannon previously. I am happy with it and find it is a nice simple printer that does a very good job. One of the things I like the most is the double sided printing option. I print a lot of documents and I like being able to print on both sides to save some paper.While I primarily print documents and manuscripts, this is a nice printer to print photos to send to a few relatives that don't check pictures out on the computer that often. I've found the photo quality to be good. I just wish the price of ink wasn't what it is, but that isn't just Epson, all ink is expensive these days.The Epson XP-630 is also a pretty small printer, so good if you have limited space. It does mean you have to open up the trays, but again, it is nice if you have limited space.I haven't tried printing on a CD or DVD yet, but it is a cool added feature as well. The wireless feature that allows you to print from your phone or tablet is also a great addition compared to my older printers. You can also use this to scan, but since I have another scanner, I don't really use this feature on the printer.This is a very nice little printer for a home office.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KAGRJI1SERFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU62T2#wasThisHelpful","R1KAGRJI1SERFY","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was getting where my laptop fan was running a lot, and it still seemed very hot on the right side. I was provided this cooling pad by LotFancy in exchange for a review, and it has helped a lot. I have been using it, and my laptop fan doesn't hardly come on at all anymore.It is a large pad, but still not quite as large as my laptop. (I have a 17 inch laptop) It is also pretty thick so the laptop sits up over an inch above the desk, table or whatever you are sitting it on.The cooling pad plugs into one of your USB ports, and that makes it convenient. There are two buttons on the back to turn on the larger fan and the small ones. There are also blue lights that come on. You can hear the fans, but they are not that noticeable.

"It's important to keep your money, credit cards, and passport safe while traveling. Not only are there pickpockets that will physically steal these items, the new thief can steal the information electronically. The Shacke RFID Pocket Vault Hybrid  Hidden Safety Travel Belt Wallet and Neck Stash helps you protect your items from both kinds of crooks.There are a number of these kinds of pouches available these days, but this one from Shacke is more thought out. I was provided one for free to provide and honest review, and I really like this design.First of all, it is made with an RFID blocking material to protect your passport and credit cards from being stolen from electronically. So that is a plus. You can still use an RFID blocking sleeve on your passport and credit cards if you wish, it would be overkill, but that isn't bad either.The wallet can be used with the neck strap hung under your shirt, or you can attack the belt loop on your belt and let it hang inside your pants. There are three compartments. This makes it easy to carry your most important items. Put your cash in the top font pocket, your credit cards in the bottom front pocket, and your passport and any larger item in the pocket that unzips down the side. (Note: The top front pocket goes all the way down the front of the wallet, so it is a deep pocket.) There are also two mesh pockets inside the larger compartment.There is also a driver's license pocket on the front with a clear plastic window and a fold down flap that secures with Velcro. This makes it easy to flip the flap up and show your picture ID if needed. The wallet even comes with an instruction card to make sure you get the most of your wallet, and contact information with an invitation to assist with any concerns.Bottom Line: The Shacke RFID Pocket Vault is a great traveling companion to store your money, credit cards, passport and other small valuables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZY7JNRNUO7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143MYCKO#wasThisHelpful","R2SZY7JNRNUO7R","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steal the Show: From Speeches to Job Interviews to Deal-Closing Pitches How to Guarantee a Standing Ovation For All the Performances in Your Life by Michael Port is an excellent guide to not only public speaking, but as the title suggests, the book also provides information to help you connect with just one person at a time. This information can help you persuade, inform, and motivate others as you successfully attain and accomplish your goals.As an actor, author and speaker, Michael Port brings his unique experiences to show how anyone can make the most of any presentation, because as he explains, we are all performing all the time. The roles may be different, but the skills he teaches here will help everyone engage with those they are interacting with, regardless if in an office, boardroom, or from a stage in a large auditorium.Part one, the performer's mindset, includes chapters on finding your voice, playing the right role in every situation, and crushing your fears and silencing your critics. All of these lay an important foundation to prepare you to take the stage. (And anything can be your stage.)Part two, powerful performance principles includes chapters on having a clear objective, acting as if, raising the stakes, saying yes and, being in the moment, and choosing early and often. These topics make much more sense as Port describes them and illustrates them with real life stories.The third and final part, a master class in public speaking, includes chapters on how to craft captivating pitches, speeches and stories, how to create and tell stories that make em laugh or cry, how to rehearse and stage world-class performances, how to produce powerful openings, command closings, and amazingly interact with audiences, how to improvise into the hearts and minds of the toughest crowds, and how to get a standing ovation ever time. Again, Port provides excellent advice on these topics and illustrates each point with personal stories and examples.The world really is a stage, and we are all performing all the time. Michael Port has written an authoritative guide on how to Steal the Show. Practicing and implementing the strategies presented here will only help people succeed through better communication. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN66HNLETH01J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054455518X#wasThisHelpful","RN66HNLETH01J","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent set of yoga straps. They are six feet long and made of 100% cotton with a hard plastic buckle. They are very strong and well stitched.  I also like the color as they are a bit more masculine than some of the colored straps out there. There is a sewn on tag near the buckle that has the brand, HF Yoga on it.I've used them for different stretches and poses, and find them to work just like you want with no hint that they won't be strong enough.

"This floating GoPro Grip Stick Pole Bobber is a nice lightweight accessory for your action camera. It is pretty simple, just a thick handle with a GoPro attachment on top to secure your camera. This attachment can be removed and you can attach any other camera or attachment (like those that hold cell phones) as the screw on top is standard size mount screw. There is also a standard size hole in the bottom. This isn't an extension pole, but rather a short grip to hold your camera. (It is easier to hold than holding the actual camera.)It comes with a wrist strap, but I don't know if I really like it attached to the top GoPro mount, and think it would be better to attach it to the bottom with a strap screw. I have those from other poles and like this a bit better.The handle is very smooth, and I was afraid it might be too slippery when wet, but even wet it was comfortable to hold onto and didn't slip like I thought. I still think I'd prefer a bit of texture or something. But as it is works fine and is comfortable to hold.The additional benefit of this handle is that it acts like a bobber and won't sink. If you were to drop your camera, this could definitely be a camera saver.I was provided one of these handles in return for an honest review and find it to be a very nice accessory for my GoPro cameras and would work for other cameras as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6I80GSU5M33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011D5XV5G#wasThisHelpful","R1L6I80GSU5M33","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The set of three canvas prints came in a large box undamaged and now look great hanging on our wall. It is a well made set and it is a very nice picture that makes the room brighten up.The mounting brackets are not attached when these arrive, so you do have to attach two to each print. This only takes a few minutes with a good screwdriver. Two screws for each bracket and two brackets for each print. There were three screws with each bracket, so you have a couple of extras.These are light enough that I just used one small nail per bracket to hang them.

"I was sent a black jump rope to review and find it to be a decent rope for exercising. The rope is a rubber type material that you can really get spinning fast.

"I was sent a pair of these yoga shorts to review and the first words that come to mind are Very Comfortable! These are right in line with other YogaAddict products I've reviewed, and that is high quality and comfort.The material has a little stretch to it, which is what helps make them very comfortable. There is a heavier waistband with a sturdy drawstring. This ties on the outside, as opposed to some that have the drawstring inside. There are no pockets, so if you need shorts with pockets, you should get something else.For an actual yoga workout, having something in your pocket could get in the way, so for the intended purpose, working out especially yoga workouts, these shorts without pockets are just right.Bottom line: These are a high quality pair of no pocket shorts for yoga and exercise, or just lounging.

"I was provided a free mount from Ipow to review and find it to work fine, with a few things I didn't care for.It's a simple devise that holds your phone while driving. It works just fine, and I've driven around with it and I do like the placement of the phone and being able to easily use my phone with voice commands and on speaker.The few downsides are you have to attach a small metal panel (two came with it, one black and one metal mirror like) to the back of your phone case. There are a few of my cases I would not want to do this with. I selected one I didn't mind, and the provided metal panel stuck to it well. With this case, the phone attaches to the holder with no problem. I have an iPhone 6 plus, and the magnet holds it just fine.You have to clamp the other end of the holder into the air vent of your vehicle. This worked fine in my vehicles vent. However, it does take away from your air conditioning in the summer, and I'm not sure I want my phone in front of the vent when using the heater. It also moved side to side at times when cornering. It wasn't the holder that moved, but the way you can direct the air with the vent, that moved side to side.Except for the concern of using it while using the heater, the moving side to side was minimal and not that big of a deal.

"I was provided this 18 x 12 Bar Service Mat by Shacke to review and am quite impressed with it. It is thicker and heavier than I thought it would be. It is made of a heavy duty rubber that stays in place on the bar top, counter, table, or anywhere else you place it.This can be used for a variety of ways besides a bar counter. It makes a good setting for a coffee carafe and cups too. Juices for the table, etc.It is made so if you spill some, it collects in the mat rather than running off. It holds quite a bit for those small spills while pouring and so on. You can have a number of them without liquid running over the sides of the mat onto your protected surface.It is easy to clean (wash when you get it to help with the new rubber smell).

"We were provided a sample cutting board to review and find it to be a good addition to the kitchen. We have tried a number of silicone kitchen products and are impressed with the versatility of this material.Did not read the e-book, so can't comment on it.The first thing you notice about this board is the bright green color. While my wife likes a lot of red kitchen things, she liked this green too.One of the most unique things about this cutting board made from silicone as compared to our other wooden and other hard material made boards is that this one is flexible. This can make it easier pouring what you chop into a pan or bowl. It's also easy to clean, and seems like it will last quite some time.It comes with two silicone pastry brushes as a bonus. Not sure how much we'll use those, but the cutting board will get a lot of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MMUKQZNJVNRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU6NDSM#wasThisHelpful","R1MMUKQZNJVNRD","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a lot of flashlights from various price ranges, but admit that most are in the lower scale. This particular light, while expensive, is an outstanding light. While made for diving, it is an incredibly bright light that can serve many purposes. I received this Phantom Aquatics Impulse 1500 through the Vine Program to review, and it is quite impressive.It is a solid, well built, albeit heavy, flashlight. It is very sturdy, and as a diving light, obviously also water tight. The flashlight comes with a carrying case that will allow you to take this flashlight anywhere with you, or store away without worry that it or the accessories will be damaged. (As if you could damage this light, it is tough.) Inside the case, besides the light you have two lithium ion batteries, that are much larger than those that come with many of the smaller aluminum type flashlights. Charger for the batteries and cord also included. There is also a wrist strap to attach to the flashlight, and a nylon/Velcro strap holder that you can attack the light to the back of your hand. (Think a kind of wrist strap that gives your wrist support, but with a Velcro strap on top to secure the light. With it attached to the back of your hand you can essentially use both hands for other things under water.) There are also a couple of extra rubber O rings included, which may be necessary as the one difficulty I had was ensuring this ring stayed in place when I put it back together after inserting batteries.There is a magnetic push button switch on the side near the light lens that cycles through three different levels of light. The brightest is 1500 lumens and is bright. This is important for underwater, but also provides you an awesome bright light for other times when you need something bright.As a home security light, turning this on and shining it into an intruder's eyes will definitely stop him for a moment, if not blind him for quite a bit longer. It also lights everything up very well if you need light in an emergency. What you do have to be careful of is pointing it into a family member's eyes.I wanted this light for a super bright home emergency light rather than diving, but my daughter and I are also using it with our masks and snorkels, so it is cool for that too. It will also be with us on any trips.If you are looking for a diving flashlight, a bright flashlight for home emergencies, or extreme outdoor conditions, this Impulse 1500 from Phantom Aquatics is an awesome choice if you don't mind the higher price tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X29JVLYB7A7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ4KCUG#wasThisHelpful","R2X29JVLYB7A7C","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having both a military and business background, this book really resonated with me. In fact, First Fast Fearless: How To Lead Like a Navy SEAL by Brian Iron Ed Hiner was one of the most enjoyable leadership books I've read in a long time. Enjoyable to read because of the interesting stories Hiner shared from his time as a SEAL, and enjoyable for the rich content and leadership advice he imparts to his readers.The book does an excellent job of taking military SEAL leadership concepts and adapting them to what Hiner even calls the real world or more accurately, the world of civilians. (I happen to agree that military life, while different, and during war  very different, is very real) Hiner is far from an academic in some ivory tower when it comes to leadership. He writes about what has worked for some of the most highly trained warriors in history, and even goes as far as pointing out what even the SEALs could do better in a a few situations. His voice and experiences should be listened to.First Fast Fearless, despite the title, is hardly a book of clich hoorah and kill em all and let God sort em out maxims. It's a true book of leadership principles that can and should be applied by anyone in a leadership position, regardless the setting. He describes what leadership truly is, the essence of brotherhood and why it's important to leadership, and the concept of battle rhythm and leading. These leadership principles are woven around the concept that leadership must be able to deal with VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Chaos, and Ambiguity). This makes sense, because it is in times of stress and difficulty that leadership is most important.When I served, I had some outstanding leaders, and some that didn't quite measure up. I would have liked serving under Hiner, as he knows what it takes to lead effectively. He also knows what it takes to train and develop successful leaders, and if you follow his guidance as set forth in this book, you will join the ranks of those successful leaders. Regardless of the organization you belong to, or how many you lead, this book's advice on leadership will help you become the leader you desire to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGKIK3GWFCAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071844880#wasThisHelpful","RBGKIK3GWFCAY","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided this 6.5 foot USB Cable for my iPhone 6 plus to review by Amroke, and after using it, I can say it is a very good cable and the extra length makes it convenient for certain situations and places.It is a basic white cable that is Apple MFI certified.

"I was sent one of these earbuds free to review from the seller. So far, it is working just fine and it is a nice little discreet earbud to listen to your bluetooth device.The sound is okay. Not as good as some earphones, but good enough. I'm not super picky with earbuds and earphones, and if you are, you may not like these.At first, I wasn't sure if they were working. When you hold the button to turn on, you hear it say powering on. Don't let up the button yet. You have to keep pressing the button until it says pairing and then select S530 on you device to connect. Once I held the button in long enough, it paired with my iPhone 6 plus with no problems.This is just ONE earbud, which for certain situations is better. I like that I can here in one ear, but my other is free to hear outside noises. For comfort it is okay. It stays in and feels fine. This bud is for listening only, not for talking too.The earbud is made in China, and the directions are not in the best English, but good enough to figure it out. For the price it is a decent little bluetooth earbud.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JRIZ8Y1VAIGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0ME68A#wasThisHelpful","R1JRIZ8Y1VAIGN","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided a black YAKAON case for my iPhone 6 plus for review. It's on my phone right now, and it is a nice case. The phone fits snugly and all of the cutouts are correct so everything functions. It is a good looking basic case of the type that the front of the phone is open, as opposed to the cases that close over the front too. (Portfolio type or wallet cases)The case seems solid and should protect the phone against drops. I don't know if it is tested to Military Specifics like my UAG case, but it does seem pretty solid. One thing I really like about this case is the flip out kickstand on the back. Using this kickstand you can set your phone both vertically or horizontally on the desk for easy viewing.Nice case for the iPhone 6 plus, especially at the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17T9T9F4Q5779/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111LZ7F4#wasThisHelpful","R17T9T9F4Q5779","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided this sensor soap dispenser from Ohuhu for a review, and we find it a nice little dispenser, but I still can't get over feeling I'm at a public restroom when using it. There is also the fact that you have to use batteries (4 AA batteries which are not included), when the old pump style works just fine. I also found it funny in the description that it says you don't have to worry about your hands coming in contact with anything harmful. In a public bathroom, yes. In our house, I sure hope not.Despite that, this is a nice little unit that is attractive and that will go with many kitchens or bathrooms. You can load it with any kind of liquid soap, and and it dispenses it just as it is supposed to.Here is one thing you must be careful of, especially if you have kids. This is used around the sinks, and it can't be submerged. Remember, it has batteries and electronics in it. The directions say to not wash this with water, but to wipe clean with a damp cloth. So it might not be the best item near a sink if you have young kids.Bottom line: Nice electronic soap dispenser that works as it should.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K61KZUXZ1JQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PY6ST2#wasThisHelpful","R3K61KZUXZ1JQ0","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you can see from the pictures, this isn't really a vest. It is, rather, a set of suspenders made from the same bright yellow with reflective strips that road vests are made from.

Those have much greater visibility as they are full vests, not just a set of suspenders.With that said, this little reflective suspender set from Ohuhu is a good option if you just want something easy to wear that has a good reflective surface for casual wear when running or biking at night.

"I was provided a coupon code to get one of these for review, and I find it to be a nice little protective covering for a GoPro camera. While the case on the GoPro is tough and protects the actual camera, this is a nice little case to wrap around the entire thing and then toss into any bag you might have.It is sort of different than most cases in that you have to wrap it around your camera, rather than a normal case that you slip the camera into and then close a flap.  This is a little more work as you have to fold over each side. I think I prefer regular cases that you just slip your item into.The case comes with a wrist strap and works well for wrapping up your GoPro to take along without any of the other accessories.

"This is a very simple strap to wear around the leg under the knee cap to provide support to the knee. It is secured by Velcro that holds well. I was provided a strap for review by the manufacturer and find it to be a good strap for what it is. It doesn't provide the support that a more full complete knee wrap provides (You have seen those sleeves with the hole at the knee cap), and it definitely isn't for those who need a knee brace. (You have see those too, with the metal or plastic bars down the side).This is a simple little strap that is comfortable and provides just a little support under the kneecap. It isn't very wide and the Velcro is strong, so it can be worn pretty easily. My wife is actually using this right now on her morning walks as one of her knees was bothering her a bit. This seems to help, as she didn't need the larger sleeve or brace.If you need support right under the knee cap, this strap fits the bill nicely.

"Scaling Force: dynamic decision-making under threat of violence with Rory Miller and Lawrence Kane is an excellent DVD to include in a self-defense library as it covers an area that is often neglected when people focus solely on physical techniques. This program explains and demonstrates options to violence and complements the authors' book of the same title.The video starts out with Miller explaining a situation in a bar setting, and then going right into the introduction of the programIn the Introduction, Miller discusses his three golden rules which the most important is going home at the end of the day. He also mentions that Kane couldn't make it to the filming and that his segments would be cut in later. It is noticeable that Kane's segments were filmed separately, but his contributions do add substance to the program, even though not as professionally filmed. He shares stories and concepts that allow you to learn from his experiences to apply to your own.The next thing discussed is Risk Assessment. In this section, Miller discusses threat assessment and how to trust instincts. He shares some things to look for that can  telegraph violence. A key here is that the higher the danger, the more force needed. This section then goes into a  section about Adrenaline, and gross motor movements.The DVD then discusses the six levels which are: Level 1. Presence; Level 2. Voice; Level 3. Touch; Level 4. Empty-hand Restraint; Level 5. Less-lethal Force; and Level 6. Lethal Force.After the six levels, some practical advice on fighting out of a crowd is presented, and then the concept of articulation and being able to tell what happened and why you did what you did to the police are discussed. I like that it is pointed out that you should practice these too.Miller points out near the beginning that he and those helping are not professional actors, and he is not a super polished speaker on DVD. However, there is a lot of great information presented in this program, and one should not dismiss it because it isn't presented in a sexy manner and because the program isn't full of fancy martial art techniques. (The program isn't about techniques at all.) Spliced in among Miller's teaching in the bar setting are Kane's segments.This isn't an exciting video, but it is an important one. When faced with violence, it is important to know the scale of force, and to enter the scale at the right level and then be able to articulate why what you did was appropriate. If you are studying self-defense skills, you need to include the information presented in this DVD with your physical training. Not knowing this information could leave you hanging in the wind when law enforcement, attorneys, judges, and jury members are determining your fate later. I personally know of a case here in Montana where the individual now serving time would have benefited from knowing and heeding the material Miller and Kane present here.Bottom line: Add this DVD to your self-defense library, study it, and know how to make better decisions under the threat of violence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VD6T8NW43OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQTEGOK#wasThisHelpful","R22VD6T8NW43OY","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Mulbess iPhone 6 plus case is a nice little brown PU leather wallet or portfolio type case. It is an attractive coffee brown classic looking case. Very plain really, which is classy.I was provided a case for review and find that the phone fits just right and everything is accessible. You do have to flip the cover open to use the phone, and I like the extra protection the cover provides. The cover flap has slots for three credit cards, and a thin pocket that will hold paper money.While this does protect the phone, and looks nice, it is not as heavy duty as some of the other cases I have. If you are doing something where there is an opportunity for your phone to get banged around or dropped, you may want a different case for those activities and use this one for when you want an attractive simple case without the military spec drop protection.Overall, this is a really nice simple portfolio type case for your phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9IQR2PMR1BP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2F8HVI#wasThisHelpful","R9IQR2PMR1BP2","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well made running belt to hold your phone, keys, money and any other small items while you run or exercise. I was provided one to review and am impressed with the quality and utility of the belt.As you can see from the pictures, there are three pockets. The two side pockets are smaller and suitable for keys, money, or anything else small. They both zip closed, and one side has a clip to hook your keys for extra security.The larger middle pocket unzips, and then there is a velcro flap inside to put your phone in the outside compartment so you can see and use the phone through the plastic pocket. You could then place something else that is thin in the compartment behind the phone if you wanted. The phone pocket is big enough for my iPhone 6 plus with a smaller case on it.There is a sweat proof lining inside the pockets to keep your items dry, and the entire belt is hand washable. It has an adjustable belt size that will fit waists from 27 to 47. The belt is elastic type material so you get a good snug fit so it doesn't move around when you are running or active.Overall, it is a very well made belt and fits the bill for anyone needing a belt to hold a phone and small items while running or doing any other activities.A bonus pair of lock laces came with the belt, but I have not tried these and can't comment on them. For those who need a pair of these, it is a nice bonus. As for the free running guide PDF ebook, it could use a lot of editing. I won't comment much more on it. I think the belt is worth 5 stars and does what it is designed to do, but not the e-book.Recommended for anyone looking for a running belt for their phone and small items.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2139T5Q4C3BAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XASHSNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2139T5Q4C3BAY","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is not a lot to say about this set of DVD Storage Bags other than they are very handy, and a great way to store or transport your DVD collection. Each bags holds up to 40 DVDs (depending on the kind of case, sets, etc.) and zips shut to protect them. You can tuck them away in a closet, under a bed, or take them with you. They have a carrying handles that makes it very easy to take them with you. The clear vinyl allows you to see what DVDs are in the bag.Obviously, you could use these clear bags for other things, but they are just the right size for DVDs, and that makes them especially handy to keep your movie collection.

"I have always been into knives more than tomahawks, even though I did use my hatchet when camping as a boy quite a bit. I realize the usefulness of a tomahawk, both as a potential weapon, and a tool, so when offered this by Vine I eagerly accepted. I'm not disappointed in this Voodoo Hawk Mini by SOG at all. It is a nice addition to my arsenal and is small and versatile enough to be useful in different ways, including camping and the potential zombie apocalypse that The Walking Dead foreshadows.This SOG Voodoo Hawk Mini is a combination of SOG's tactical Tomahawk and FastHawk. It is smaller and lighter version made for backpackers, hikers, hunters and paddlers. It has a glass-reinfored nylon handle, extended cutting head, spike for piercing, and a metal pommel cap. It comes with a top loading synthetic nylon sheath for belt carry.I like SOG products for being durable at affordable prices, and I find this tomahawk fitting that description. Yes, it is made in China, but it is a decent tool at a reasonable price. It is small, and lightweight, so it is more suitable for smaller tasks. Great for getting kindling, but not as good if you needed to split larger wood or heavy duty chopping. It is a small tomahawk after all, not an ax. The metal pommel would be okay for pounding in tent stakes or similar tasks, but it isn't going to do what a good hammer would.The back spike has limited uses as well, but seems pretty strong for what it is. I think it would definitely sink into a zombie's brain if you were forced to fight them off with just this.I also like that SOG has a Lifetime Warranty. I'm not sure just what all this covers, but it is listed prominently on the packaging.The last thing I'll mention is that this tactical tool from the SOG line looks cool. I'm guessing some people will want one for that very reason, and that's okay. Because even though it is a tool, and not a toy, there is nothing wrong with a tool looking cool and tough, and this Voodoo Mini Hawk does look cool and tough. I like it, and it makes a good addition to my other bladed weapons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0SX75ER6123/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3QBYIO#wasThisHelpful","R3M0SX75ER6123","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been one that liked to keep a hold of my weapons rather than throw them. With that said, I've enjoyed practicing throwing since I was young. I used to stick sharpened throwing stars in all sorts of things when younger, and I've practiced off and on with throwing knives throughout the years. While I'm nowhere near as good as some of those I've taken classes from, I find it an enjoyable thing to do with my other martial art training.I haven't thrown tomahawks, but have wanted to. Now, with this set of three throwing hawks from SOG, I'm learning and practicing a bit. SOG is a known company for affordable and durable tools, which includes many bladed items. I've liked the products I've purchased from them in the past, and I like this set of throwing hawks.The are solid steel with a paracord wrapped handle. One side has an ax head and the other a point. They are balanced for throwing, but that doesn't mean you don't have to practice to get it down. Besides throwing, it is a handy little tool for the woods. They are small and lightweight, but tough enough to do small tasks like getting kindling ready for a fire. They are a solid little hawk. They come with a bottom loading synthetic nylon sheath that holds all three for an upside down carry.I also like that SOG has a Lifetime Warranty. I'm not sure just what all this covers, but it is listed prominently on the packaging.I'm looking forward to practicing more with these because it is fun. I'll get out my copy of Michael Janich's Making It Stick and continue to practice. Recommend for anyone wanting to do the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUZNH4W0YCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1I7F54#wasThisHelpful","R2FUZNH4W0YCC","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very impressed with the Zookki GoPro Accessory Kit. I was provided a kit to review and found these aftermarket accessories to be well made and great additions to your GoPro kit, allowing you to do more with your action camera.As you can see from reading the description, you get a lot of stuff in this package of accessories. The items that most people will most likely get this kit for are the chest strap, head strap, and suction cup mount. All of these work well with my camera the wearable ones are comfortable enough to wear. One thing you might notice is there is a slight odor to the straps and the pouch. I can't quite place the smell, but it is not that pleasant, so you will want to air out these items.The extendable monopod is one of the cheaper aluminum extension types, and I don't like these for my GoPro as much as the sturdier more solid poles with the clips on the sections. These poles are more expensive and I wouldn't expect them in a kit such as this at this price. This pole will definitely hold your GoPro or other small camera, but I wouldn't use it for any action or where you are moving a lot. I'd opt for a sturdier pole. For not moving around, this pole works fine.The other items in the kit are nice to have extras of. The mounts, screws, and adhesive pads are good to have. There is also a floating handle grip that will be useful when using in or around water. There is also a bike mount to attach to handle bars.Over all, you get an awful lot with this kit, so if you are looking for some well made affordable GoPro accessories, this kit is a good way to start. Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBQ6HJAO8LHA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEKHVSU#wasThisHelpful","RBQ6HJAO8LHA0","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided one of these alarm clocks to review and it is a very nice USB charged alarm clock. The one I received isn't square like the photo, but rather a longer rectangle shape.  Using the instruction book and the buttons on the back, it was pretty easy to set the time, date, and alarm.One thing I like is the top is touch rather than a button. So when you touch the top the light comes on so you can read it in the dark. (Note, there is a dimmer light that comes on when in total darkness to help you read it in the dark without turning on the light.) Touching the top is much easier than finding a button. This same feature activates the snooze. So you don't have to click a button off, but rather just touch the top of the clock to get the alarm to stop.It is battery powered that is charged with a USB cable. I'm not sure how many days it will go between charging, but it has a light that comes on to let you know to charge it. Using it at home, I can easily plug it into one of our computers, or a USB wall charger. On the go, you could charge it the same way or with a portable power bank.As an added feature, it is also a thermometer. Besides the date and time, it tells you the temperature of the room.For a basic alarm clock that is powered with a USB charging cable, this is a nice little clock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDA2MIPZ10ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHP07HE#wasThisHelpful","R1HDA2MIPZ10ZB","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent a blue fan to review, and it is a nice little fan. At first, I was a bit worried as it didn't come on when I first plugged it into my laptop and turned it on. But then it did, and is working fine now.It is very quiet for a fan of this type, which I like, and for its size, it puts out a good little bit of air. There is only one speed, so it is on or off. You can't select a lessor or greater speed. It is powered by a USB cord, so you can plug it into your laptop as I have it plugged in right now, your computer, or any other USB charging device. This includes different power banks. I hooked it up to one of the power banks I have and it ran just fine. This means you can use this fan anywhere. (Yes, I know that there are small battery powered fans, but this is a bit nicer and the USB feature allows you more options and longer use than batteries.)Bottom line: This is a nice little USB powered fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VKQDYAVDYMTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFITSRI#wasThisHelpful","R1VKQDYAVDYMTL","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How To Sell Books By The Truckload On Amazon by Penny C. Sansevieri is actually two short books by Sansevieri combined into one volume. This book contains How to Sell Books by the Truckload and How to Get More Reviews on Amazon. Both contain useful information for authors, and even combined the book isn't so big to make it daunting. Keeping the entire manual short and to the point allows it to be very user friendly.What I liked most about this book is that it isn't one of those work the system to almost scamming type programs you see floating around. Someone wants to show you how to make a lot of money by doing things that aren't quite honest. Sansevieri isn't like that. She shares honest, workable strategies to sell more books and get more reviews, but they do take work.If you are new to amazon, or just want to understand how amazon works a bit better this is a good introductory book. It explains easily what you can do to sell more on this giant website. It then goes into detail on how you can ethically get reviews for your book. This takes some work too, but will be worth it.As an author myself, I plan to use this guide to help me with what I'm doing on amazon. It's a book I'd recommend to anyone wanting to do the same, especially beginners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UN53W2DTJQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508563365#wasThisHelpful","R2UN53W2DTJQ2","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't really try to compare Greaney with Clancy. They worked together, and now Greaney is carrying on the series and writing excellent novels with characters I've enjoyed for years. Sure, they are not the same as Clancy's earlier works, and it is hard to say how much Clancy did on the collaborations before he died. But I still greatly enjoy these stories, and I like the writing style of Greaney too. With this newest novel, Full Force And Effect, I thoroughly enjoyed it and could have gone on for another 600 pages. There were plot twists, suspenseful action, and a tense assassination attempt that had me on the edge of my seat as I turned pages.The plot of this novel involves a lot regarding North Korea, and as I've lived in South Korea, this aspect of the story really interested me. As with most of this series, the action takes place globally and there is a lot going on, all interconnected and done in a way to keep you turning pages.President Jack Ryan, along with campus members Jack Jr., Sam, Dom, John Clark and Chavez are present and featured doing what they do best. It was a fun read that I enjoyed a lot.

"I was sent this Ambielly Universal Waterproof Pouch to provide a review and I find it to be a nice waterproof bag for your phone or other small valuables. Note, this is a waterproof bag, not really a protective case. The good thing is that it is large enough to put your phone with a protective case on it inside. It is orange, which my daughter really likes, so this one will be used by her.I did do what the instructions recommended and put in a piece of paper and submerged the case in a sink of water for a while. The paper was completely dry when I took it out, so it passed the waterproof test. As long as I have one of my slimmer iPhone 6 plus cases on the phone, it slips into this case very easily. I liked that you didn't have to force it in or out. And I liked that it would hold the phone and a case for added protection.You can still use the features of the phone when it is in the case.It comes with a lanyard that attaches to the top that I like. You can wear it around your neck if you want, which is an easy way to keep it when using this case.The pouch can be punctured, so be careful and don't put anything sharp in it, and I'd add to keep it away from sharp objects or it could be easily punctured by those as well. You also can't use it in hot springs or it could melt.This is a handy little waterproof bag for phones or small items.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JQ1VY5EW2AQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z08WL5O#wasThisHelpful","R37JQ1VY5EW2AQ","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent one of these to review and it turns out to be a cool little recording device. It looks like, and is the size of a flash drive. When you take off the cap, it goes into the computer just like any other flash drive. It holds 8GB.The unique thing about this is besides being a flash drive, it is also a voice recorder. There is a small button on the side that you switch on. When you do this, a red light comes on for a couple of seconds, and then blinks three times and goes off. When it goes off after blinking, the device is recording. It will record until you switch it off, and the red light will flash before going off.When you plug the device in, there will be a folder named record. Your audio file will be in this folder and just play it with any audio file player. Worked just like it was supposed to do. It picked up my voice fine sitting by the computer in front of me, and holding it out at arms length while talking. It also picked up the television set across the room.The little instruction sheet says it can record for up to 13 hours on a full charge. I have not timed to see what kind of batter life you can get, or how long it will record to fill the 8GB.After the three red flashes, there is no indicator that it is recording, thus the spy feature in the description. While the descriptions suggest that this is a way to record when someone doesn't want to be recorded, I would caution people that this could get you in trouble. So be careful what you record with this discreet little recorder.The device works like it is supposed to, and I am impressed with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MTGII4JKNJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2GY2UY#wasThisHelpful","R26MTGII4JKNJG","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many crimes are crimes of opportunity, and this is especially true with theft. It's not that a small lock like this can't be broken into, it's that this little lock makes is more difficult to quickly get into a bag or a locker, and thus it takes away the easy opportunity. A thief will most often look for something easier, as in not locked and out in the open. So having a lock such as this on your bag, or on your locker at the gym, is a good idea and can prevent your belongings from being stolen. Again, it is not that this lock can't be defeated if someone really wants in, but by making your item a harder target than something with no lock, thieves looking for targets of opportunity may just pass it by.This is a TSA lock, which means there is a key hole on the bottom that the TSA can quickly open it up and check inside your bag if they wish. The alternative is have them cut it off or delay you in getting your bag.It is a simple 3 number combination lock that you can change the combination easily and whenever you want. I was provided this lock free for review purposes and I find that it is just as advertised. For a luggage, or locker, combination padlock, this is a nice little lock.

"There are many variations of selfie sticks or monopods on the market these days. I was sent this stick by Mudder to review and find it to fit with the standard aluminum collapsible sticks. I prefer the black sticks made of different material with the clips that secure. These are usually bigger and sturdier, but also cost more. Those are also better for GoPro type cameras as well as cell phones.For a cell phone and casual use of taking selfies, this is a nice stick. It is light weight and definitely sturdy enough at full extension to take selfies. (Note, it is a bit wobbly at full extension, so this isn't a stick to be rough with. But with normal use, it works. Just don't be rough with it.) Many have a bluetooth feature, but this one actually has a cable to put into the earphone jack of your phone that is attached to the button on the handle.  The nice thing about this is that you don't have to charge the bluetooth and worry about it connecting. This connected to my iPhone and worked just like it was supposed to.This stick comes with a cell phone holder, but you can also use any of the others on the market. You can also attach any small, and I mean small, camera with the standard sized screw on the end.This is a good little selfie stick of this type.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZS517X7YNA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W95UAOK#wasThisHelpful","RLZS517X7YNA8","ADEVBXUS0RSIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADEVBXUS0RSIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grabbed these at Petco's website on a 50% off sale, so at $2.49 they were a very good deal (got free shipping because my order was over a certain amount).  Even at $4.99 each I think they would be a good purchase for my hammies.  I have two of these, one for each roborovski dwarf hamster I have.  They immediately took to them - they climb over them and run under them... Sometimes they just sit under them while they eat a snack.  It's been 3 or 4 months now and the hams still find these bridges interesting.They don't chew on them much, they've just nibbled it to test it, but they have Paragon Whimzees small dog chews that they love.  My hams just aren't big wood chewers.I didn't find these bridges flimsy at all, I think they're sturdy for my hams - but my robo dwarf hamsters are small, they each only weigh an ounce.  The bridges don't even wobble as the hams are clambering over them.  So if you have mice or dwarf hamsters, I give this toy a thumbs up.  If you have a Syrian hamster, I think they might be too big & will topple this toy over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABI8TSSRIAHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00555RAF8#wasThisHelpful","R1ABI8TSSRIAHE","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two robo dwarf hamsters love this sand, it's soft and fine and easy on their paws, with no dustiness. I've been using this sand for them for 6 months, no problems (I'll update this review if there ever are any problems).  I have it in containers so they can dig & roll to their heart's content, and I also have this sand in jars that are tilted on their side which they use as their bathroom. As someone else said, this sand clumps hamster urine quite well - ""potty training"" my robos has made it much easier to keep the cage clean. Very happy with the price of this sand too.  Buying it in the 25 lb box, I take it out to the garage and separate it into gallon size Ziploc bags (it fills like 2.5 bags) because it's easier to carry and use.If anyone is wondering, ""Desert White"" isn't really white, it's a tan color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7CD1WWG9E1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017UB3PI#wasThisHelpful","R2W7CD1WWG9E1B","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I didn't like these cornbread croutons (but I am a *very* picky eater so these being just ""different"" - slightly different texture, flavor - than regular croutons was what turned me off), my husband loved them with chili.  I kept a couple bags for him but gave the rest to my parents who had them at our family dinner gatherings, and they were a hit.My family had them with salads, with soup... The croutons were gone in less than a month.  Everybody liked them because they were ""different"" from regular croutons (someday, oh someday I will outgrow my picky eater ways and be able to enjoy these croutons).  I'm fairly confident that if you like new foods, you'll like these croutons, since everybody else in my family was reaching for more of these and asking where I'd found them.  They have a rich buttery flavor to them.  My sister, who loves cornbread with chili, bought more of these to go in chili-themed gift baskets she put together (these croutons, chili soup mixes, bottle of hot sauce).If you want to just try one bag, you can check Fresh Gourmet's website, they have a handy product locator that tells you if a store has a specific flavor you're looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HK0U30I05BY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006CFVIZS#wasThisHelpful","R2HK0U30I05BY7","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whiskers the roborovski dwarf hamster would give this wheel 5 stars, she loved it and ran like mad on it - she also has a 6.5"" Silent Spinner, a medium Flying Saucer, and a Wodent Wheel Jr., so of course this cheap & noisy Comfort Wheel would be her favorite.  It's just big enough for her that her back remained straight while running on it... I think any hamster bigger than a robo dwarf might be a touch too big for this 5.5"" wheel.I knocked 2 stars off because it doesn't last long, at least not with Whiskers running marathons on it all night long.  I would take the wheel off its axle for cleanings and plastic shavings would fall off the axle - it's just plastic grinding on plastic as it spins.  I tried the ""wrapping tape around axle then putting vegetable oil on it"" YouTube tip but it didn't make the wheel any quieter, and it still ground on itself near the tip of the axle, if that makes sense.  As the plastic ground down on itself the wheel got wobblier, and after a month of use I had to throw the wheel away as the wheel was dangerously loose on the axle.  (I got her another 5.5"" Comfort Wheel as a replacement and it has the same problems, so I don't think the 1st wheel was simply defective.)Also, this wheel sounds like a rattling plate when it's being used.  It didn't bother us as the hamsters' room is on the other side of the house from our bedroom..  But I know a lot of people have their hamster in their bedroom, and this wheel isn't the best for that situation unless you're a heavy sleeper or you have some sort of white noise machine to drown out the rattling of the wheel.For a few dollars more, I recommend going with the Kaytee Silent Spinner instead - it's 6.5"" size is better suited for all dwarf hamsters, it's quieter, and our Silent Spinners (our other robo dwarf hamster runs hard on her Silent Spinner every night) have lasted 5 months just fine so in the long run the Silent Spinners are actually a better value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POCCF9TPIA2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000256DVS#wasThisHelpful","R1POCCF9TPIA2I","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this sucralose powder and highly recommend it.  I first ordered the 50 grams to try it out, and now I buy the 250 gram size package, which will last me a long time.I make sweet tea in quart size jars and use 12 packets of Splenda in a jar (yes, I have a sweet tooth) and it was a bit bothersome counting out packets and tearing each one open.  With this BulkSupplements sucralose powder, I use 1/16 teaspoon in each jar of tea and to me it seems to be the same sweetness as 12 packets Splenda.Love it love it love it, and much cheaper than buying Splenda packets.  Also, each Splenda packet actually has 4 calories and when I'm using 12 at a time (48 calories!) it adds up.  This sucralose powder is truly calorie-free because it doesn't have the filler that Splenda has.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24E0K2PD2CAD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCXMBD2#wasThisHelpful","R24E0K2PD2CAD3","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What gets this a 1-star rating is the fluffy stuff in the middle - I don't know what it is, but if it is what it looks like (fluffy cotton or polyester fiber?) then it's very hazardous for hamsters.  If they pouch it, it can stick to the lining of their cheeks and they can't get it out, leading to a cheek impaction (deadly if not treated).  Or it can get caught in their digestive systems, also deadly.  It's why fabric or thread or yarn shouldn't be used around hamsters at all.  I have 2 roborovski dwarf hamsters and I knew the fluffy yellow stuff in the middle of this toy was a no-no, so I removed every last wisp of the fluff from the wood part of the toy.Just the wood alone is 5 stars, my hams love it.  They only chew it a little (they have Paragon Whimzees alligator dental dog treats to chew on), but they really like scrambling over the wood block, and will go out of their way just to pass through the middle of the wood block as they go from one place to another.  They find it interesting, so that's a thumbs up for me.Still, I think it's irresponsible for Multipet to put that fluffy fiber in the middle of the toy so my 1 star rating stands - if someone doesn't know better then they'll give it to their hamster which will cause a lot of suffering.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZXOMWIUB6PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR8K77M#wasThisHelpful","R1XZXOMWIUB6PL","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My roborovski dwarf hamsters love these little sand baths, I have one for each ham.  It's been several weeks but they don't use them as potties (for going pee, they seem to prefer small glass jars tilted on their side with some sand in them), but they took to them right away with no hesitation, using them as sand baths & rolling around with joy.  Sometimes they just sit in there because they like to.  Highly recommend these, my hamsters use them every day & it's quite fun for them.  Also it's a bonus that the lid on these keeps sand from being flung around the cage when they roll around or get into a digging mood.I'm not sure I would recommend these for a Syrian hamster as I think these sand baths are too small for that species of hamster (I've never had Syrians, but I understand they're about 4 times the size of my little robo dwarfs).  But for robos like mine, or other dwarf hamster species, these sand baths are the perfect size.I ordered these from ""uxcell"" directly (not the Fulfilled By Amazon option) and my order took 2 weeks to arrive from overseas, which is fine as I wanted to save a couple bucks per sand bath.  Also, they came in a plastic shipping bag with no bubble wrap protection, yet these plastic sand baths didn't have a single crack or scratch on them... these little sand baths are surprisingly sturdy and well made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5JWBFNZ4V8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HR6B3GU#wasThisHelpful","R3K5JWBFNZ4V8B","A383XURHVF8ON6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A383XURHVF8ON6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We get mice in the cupboard space under our master bathroom jet tub (not in the kitchen, but in the bathroom... it seems odd).  I usually use the Rat Zapper Ultra which I really like for a lot of reasons, but its big downside is that it should be meticulously cleaned after each mouse kill, otherwise we eventually get ""misfires"" as the trigger plate corrodes and the Rat Zapper can no longer be used.I liked these Victor Clean Kill traps because of their low cost and they're easy to reset, no careful cleaning needed between kills.  I hadn't used traps in several months so the mice had moved back in and were getting comfortable.  I used peanut butter as my bait, and had my first mouse kill the 2nd night after setting it under the master bath tub area.  I caught mouse #2 the night after that.  Then, no more.  That's typical, we catch 2-3 mice then nothing for months, no sign of mice.So for me, these Victor Clean Kill traps worked as they should, and when they start getting gross they're inexpensive enough to toss and by more.

It comes in a silver foil resealable bag which is great when not using a lot at a time. I added about 2 cups into my heat pack and it gives a nice lavender scent that isn't overpowering but very relaxing. The flowers are not as purple as the picture shows but in my case color doesn't really matter it's all about the scent. I have heated mine up numerous times since I have gotten my order and it still smells just as fresh. I will for sure be purchasing this again. It would be great for making homemade scented gifts for others this holiday season.To make the heat pack as I do I just take a flannel cloth and sew it shut in a rectangle shape then add corn feed and mix the lavender in then heat for 2 minutes.

It also has a no sound setting so you don't even need it to talk but it won't be completely off. On the bottom of the truck there is an off button that can switch to go which makes the center wheel pop up which allows movement. The firetruck will move in all directions and if it bumps anything it will back up and move a different way. It takes 3 AA batteries which is secure underneath the fire truck with a small screw so only an adult will be able to open the battery area.

"Easy solution to keeping your plumbing clear every month. This is every easy to use. You use the included scoop to add a double dose of PlumbClear into a cup of warm NOT hot water and let it sit for 2-4 hours this is how the enzymes activate before you pour them into the drain. After the enzymes have activated you just simply pour into your toilet or down the drain. One week after your first treatment you do the same process again. Then you do it once a month after that. So only your very first month do you have to do it more then once but again it's super easy and safe for your plumbing.

"This is a very beautiful flowing dress. It's lightweight, soft and comfortable. I got the Arrow blue color and it is a light beige and navy blue dress. The light beige is sheer and you can see through is. However the blue spots are double layered so you can not see through those spots. This is a nice dress for a casual or formal event. This dress is long though so you either need to be tall to wear with flats or sandals or wear with heals. However the material it is made with you could get the dress hemmed up to the perfect length you need it. I am beyond satisfied with all of this dress. I would highly recommend it to others.

"To tell you I am in love with this poncho would be an understatement. I am plus size so I was a little iffy about buying something that says one size but after reading the description and they mentioned plus size I decided to give it a shot and wow, they weren't lying. The poncho fits with room to spare! It's lightweight which is something I really like especially in Florida. It can be worn over any shirt long or short sleeves and look great. Looks perfect with jeans, or even with leggings. With Fall here this is a perfect go to cover for me. I love how roomy it is which adds to how comfortable it is. I went with the Wine Burgundy Marsala color and it's a nice deep color that just looks fabulous! I do however want all the colors to add to my wardrobe now. I am very impressed with the fit of this poncho and would highly recommend it whether you are a size 0 or a size 6x+ you will find comfort and be able to wear this.

"This is by far the cutest mouse I have ever used. It's pretty small which is something I like since my hands are not that big. It is wired which I don't mind. It also lights up a red color from the optical underneath. This is a really cute orange and white rabbit mouse. I do find there is an ease of clicking the buttons and it doesn't make much noise. I know some people don't like a loud clicking mouse especially if you are clicking a lot.  I homeschool my daughter and son who are 9 and 10 and often they use the computer, they also prefer this mouse over our old regular one and I believe because it is just easier to use.

" 2:35 MinsThis is beyond super cool! It's not only interesting to learn about it's amazing to watch! The slime comes in a nice tin to keep it in. When you get it the magnet is on top of a closed packet of the slime. The slime is a bit moist when you first take it out of the package but after you play with it for a little bit it goes away. Now the fun part is watching how the slime will either attract the magnet or it will pull itself towards the magnet which will result in it devouring the magnet which is pretty neat to watch. Even though the magnet pulls the slime towards it, it takes a little bit of time before it is fully around the entire magnet, which you can see in my video.

" 0:47 MinsI find this 3D maze ball to be an awesome puzzle that is great for kids or adults. It has bright colors inside of a clear plastic ball. You need to move the ball around to maneuver the little silver ball through the maze. It may sound easy but it can get tricky. One wrong twist and you have to start over. My 9 year old simply loves sitting and figuring this out. She has yet to make it fully through but she is determined to do it. I think this is great with helping her concentrate, improve cognitive skills and brainstorming. I would much rather my kids be ""playing"" with this then with a video game. Best of all this is something you can take with you anywhere. You don't need to worry about losing pieces everything is contained inside. I am very satisfied with this and would recommend it for kids old enough to understand this isn't something you throw around and it's even great for adults and this can even be very useful for elderly folks.

"I have never used actual face paint to do any type of designs so I decided to give it a go, this kit is very newbie friendly. I read the instructions and rather then wetting each paint to activate I kept a spray bottle next to me and put a small amount in the color I needed as I needed it. The texture reminded me of water colors paint and glided on smooth. The paint also dried pretty fast, and I was able to apply colors over other colors without a problem such as red dots over the black. I am not very artistic but I think the end result came out great. My daughter wore the face paint for hours it wasn't itchy and the paint didn't smear or smudge off. In this kit there is 8 different colors, red, yellow, white, black, dark blue, green, purple, and dark blue. You also get 4 different tools to help you apply the paint.

"I use a heat pack just about daily for back and neck pain. I must say I really like this one due to it's size. It's long which is perfect for covering my entire lower back and it's great for getting around my entire neck. The material this is made out of is a thick fleece that provides a nice barrier between the rice on the inside so you get just enough of the heat through without burning yourself. I also like the bright colors. I got the canyon turquoise style and the turquoise, red, yellow, white, brown and black all go together great with a nice design. The rice delivers a nice even heat and surprisingly it stays hot for a decent amount of time. This heat wrap also stays in place so you don't need to worry about holding it in the right position. I have used other heat packs in the past and I must say I am very pleased with this one as it doesn't have a smell to it before or after cooking. It also doesn't take a long time to get the desired heat needed to relax your muscles. I personally heat it for 2 minutes then shake the rice around and heat for an additional 30 seconds and it's good to go.

" 1:16 MinsI am a nail polish hoarder! I love having nail polishes off all different colors so this rack was something highly needed. This rack is huge! It's  24 inches by 21 inches and you can fit a ton of nail polish on it. Depending on the sizes and shapes of your polish determines how many you can fit but I will say their estimate of 96 is accurate. I personally got 115 but again they are of all sizes so not everyone can get that many. I do like that it is fully put together right out of the box. Which was delivered inside of another box with styrofoam around it to protect the rack when shipping. It is a hard sturdy plastic with 6 shelves. Each shelf has a little lip so your nail polishes won't fall off. There is also 4 pre-drilled screw holes in each of the corners to allow you to easily hang the rack on the wall if you wish. You do not need to hang it if you do have the counter space as it is sturdy enough to stand on it's own the choice is really up to you. Even though this is advertised as a nail polish rack it can be used for smaller bottles of essential oils. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this rack it is very useful and now all my nail polish are neatly organized no more digging through boxes to find that perfect color.

"I got Xoom cubes not so much for the game aspect of it but as a way to help my dyslexic daughter. She is 8 and I home school her and anything that has to do with letters gets her frazzled. Trying to find unique fun ways to help her and not confuse her brain so much I decided to give these a shot I figured she can see the letters and not be overwhelmed. We start by using them for spelling words and it really helps her to have the cubes in front of her so she can focus one letter at a time. Her brain doesn't work like ours does so when she sees a bunch of letters together it starts mixing them up which can drive anyone crazy. I am finding teaching her this way is helping her a lot and she isn't getting headaches and is actually learning. I am very impressed and absolutely love this concept. Once she is more confidant in herself we will use this in the traditional way but it is a step in the right direction for now.

"Silicone molds are a favorite of mine. I love going all out for decorating cakes and treats or everyone's birthdays. With this 2 set of molds I am able to use chocolate or even make my own gummy treats in letter and number form! That is super cool! I do like that the letters are pretty small and I thought it would be extremely fragile when trying to get the chocolate out but it wasn't they were solid and popped out easily and perfect! I will be using these molds for writing on my daughters birthday cake. The numbers are a bit larger and actually remind me of numbered candles so these will actually replace the numbered candles and allow me to still decorate full with the age without the wasted cost of buying a candle to throw out after you use it. Fully edible is perfect for me! The molds are sturdy yet bendable. They are very easy to clean without needing to scrub.

"I really love the quality of this 2 in 1 tactical survival knife. First off it's a high quality knife that has a tight secure clip on the back so you can easily clip it on your belt and not have to worry about it falling off. It has a very strong led light that does come out of the knife and it has a strong magnet on the back which keeps it in place and it also can be used to attach to anything magnetic. At the bottom of the knife there is a switch for using the magnesium fire starter. You do need to use a little force to get the piece out which is a good thing. It means it won't accidentally slip out and get lost. The switch plate is located on the side of the knife. Which gives you a strong sturdy strike when/if you need to get a fire started. The knife itself is pretty light weight considering all it is able to do. It's a very rugged and sturdy knife. I have no doubts in how well made this is after handling it myself. I would highly recommend it as it's perfect for camping, hiking or any survival situation. I received this for free in exchange for my review, good or bad.

"ParticleGrip Studded Skin Set for Xbox One by Foamy Lizard has enhanced my gaming to a whole new level. I am an avid gamer and play at least once a day. I can sit for hours and as you know an intense match of call of duty can leave your hands sweaty making it hard to grip the controller. I am pleased at how well these skins work. They are lightweight and don't add any bulk to my controller. The stud's allow me to always have a firm grip on my controller. I also like how well the grips work as they allow me to have full control and still work the analog stick around very smoothly. The grips come with 2 different size sets so you can pick which size you are more comfortable using. I have smaller hands so I do prefer the short small grips but my husband actually likes the taller ones. The skin is a soft silicone and very easy to slide around your controller without blocking anything including the microphone port, battery pack, or sync button. Since they do come in a variety of colors every gamer in your house can have a different color or you can mix and match skin and grips.  I am very excited and love my new skin and grips. I have played for many hours at a time and had no issues with my skin or grips, nothing slipped off. I would highly recommend other Xbox One gamer's to purchase these they are well worth it and amazing! I was sent samples of this product in a few colors for free in exchange for my honest review.

"This magic pen doodle mat works great however it's VERY small! I got it for my dyslexic child to try and use it to help writing letters and it does work okay for that but not writing a lot at once since you need to wait for it to dry in between. The concept is great as you just fill the pen up with water but the size is not ideal. Maybe good for a toddler on a road trip but nothing more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KNTR3AV5XT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013842F7K#wasThisHelpful","R11KNTR3AV5XT9","A3HQJCTFLMPMNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQJCTFLMPMNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dinosaur Party Pack Bundle is an amazing set filled with a ton of dinosaurs. Any Dinosaur fan would approve! You get a set that has 2 build your own glow dinosaur skeletons. This was a fun build and my kids were happy to be able to build their own. You also get a pack of 12 mini dinosaurs which has all different dinosaurs they are well made and different colors also. Next you get a pack of 6 stretchable dinosaurs! These are super cool and have a metallic shine to them. You also get a variety of dinosaurs ranging in different colors. Lastly and probably one of my favorite part of this set is you get 2 large dinosaurs! They are two different dinosaurs and are solid and well made. I am very happy with this set as are my children.

"EWEI's Homewares Premium Heavy Duty Double Rail Adjustable Telescopic Rolling Clothing and Garment Rack is high quality and works great. Set up time took me about 12 minutes from start to finish it was very simple to put together. It is aluminum and has dark purple connector corners. I think the purple gives it a nice look. The bars high can be adjusted so this is perfect for people of all shapes and sizes. You can be guaranteed nothing will drag on the floor. There is enough space between each rail that you can easily look through and move clothes around without knocking other clothing pieces off the other rail. This rack is completely stable and doesn't wobble. I love that it can not collapse so I don't need to worry about that being an issue. I personally live in a small house so we have issues with space mainly that we have a super tiny closet. My husband and I both can't have our clothes hanging up at the same time but now with this we can both have our clothes hanging up and neatly organized. The rack is also on wheels so we have it in the corner next to the dryer and when we need it we just roll is out grab what we need and roll it back. This has been a lifesaver for sure. I am very impressed with the quality and also how much clothes this actually holds. I would highly recommend this to others as you won't be disappointed.

"Fun Krazy straws are awesome! Who doesn't love drinking out of funky shaped straws? With this set you get 2 6 packs of fun krazy straws AND 4 color changing straws you can't go wrong! You get 6 different colors of the krazy straws which is purple, blue, red, orange, green and black so two of each color. The color changing straws you get pink which changes to purple, yellow which changes to green, blue which changes to purple, and white which changes to blue. These straws are reusable and are honestly easier to clean then I expected. They are heavy duty and well made. Whether you are having a party or just want a little fun in your day these are the straws for you! I also like how thick the color changing straws are it makes them perfect for milkshakes or smoothies. I personally think it makes drinking an ice cream float more fun and my kids will drink anything with these straws. I highly recommend these!

"As a home schooling Mother we go through crayons like crazy! My daughter also has a temper problem and when frustrated she will scribble which will lead to marks on the table. This is a great set as you get 3 packs of 24 count. They wash off without having to scrub. These crayons in my opinion are a bit more smoother and less waxier then non washable crayons.

"Since my kids have been very into dinosaurs I knew this could be some great fun on a rainy day. Especially since after you mold the clay it needs to sit for a day to allow it to harden. You get 3 boxes of solar fossils. Each box contains 1 random mold and one bag of clay. You open the clay and mush it around in your hands for a bit to soften it up. The clay had a nice light gritty texture to it and it didn't make a mess. My kids neatly molded the three dinosaurs and had a generous amount of clay left over so they decided they wanted to make some dinosaurs not in fossil form. In total they got 3 complete fossil dinosaurs and 6 regular dinosaurs. Once we allowed them all to harden which was 2 days in our case due to rain we took them outside so they can change color. The color it changes isn't a full on color change but rather a purple tint to it but you can notice if you seen it before hand. Overall I think it was great honest fun that the kids enjoyed doing. They now have them displayed in their room on the shelf and are asking for more kits to try and get the 6 dinosaurs they didn't get. I would recommend this to others.

" 0:36 MinsAs a home schooling Mom I am always looking for hands on projects to do with my kids. This was perfect for that. Uncle Beaudreaux's owl pellet kit comes with gloves, tweezers, wooden picking stick, and 2 owl pellets. I like that it came with 2 owl pellets as each one of my kids were able to dig into their own pellet. You also get a brief history lesson on owls and these pellets. Before reading my daughter who is 8 stopped me in my tracks and said ""is this poop? Gross, I'm out"" however once we read we learned that owl pellets in fact are NOT poop they are regurgitated so they consist of bones and feathers that an owl can not digest. Very similar to a cat hair ball. The kids had fun digging through sorting everything they found and comparing one pellet to the other. This is one project that they won't forget. I am very happy with how great this science lesson worked out for them. They got to learn and have first hand knowledge of what an owl pellet is. I would highly recommend this educational kit as it's an excellent learning experience for kids of all ages. I received this for free in exchange for my honest review.

"As a kid I remember doing sun prints using regular construction paper then waiting hours! My kids are always on the go and waiting hours just isn't what they are interested in doing so I am very pleased with this solar imagine sun print paper kit. The kit came with little decorations inside that you can lay on your paper or you could use your own. Each kit comes with 12 sheets so there is more then enough for you to do this quite a few times. You even get a test paper so you can practice where you are going to place your items. The kids had a thrill rushing against the sun to place their items down in just the right spot that they planned. After about 3 minutes you will clearly see the paper turn white that is when you rinse the paper in cool water to deactivate the paper. Then you dry off the paper and the piece you made is ready to be displayed and shown off. We all loved doing this project that the kids keep thinking of new things to make.

"Learning and a do it yourself project all in one! In this kit you not only get everything you need to make your own chewing gum you get a brief history about chicle gum. There is easy to read and understand step by step instructions. This can be made on the stove or inside your microwave. We decided to go for the microwave approach as I knew my kids would be anxious to get to making and eating the gum. I also like that you get 2 different flavors so you have some options in which flavor you chew. I am pleasantly surprised by just how much gum this little kit created. I know my kids and I have learned a few things that we never knew before and we for sure will think of gum in a new way! I would highly recommend this.

The cinnamon flavor on each stick is amazing! It has a nice hot taste but not spicy hot, it's a cinnamon hot that leaves a nice taste in your mouth.

"Tiny miniature fairy garden collection of seashells is great quality. The mini seashells come in a little plastic jar with a screw on top which helps keep your shells safe so they don't break. The shells are all various sizes and are no bigger then a quarter. They are all unique and they have so much detail in each one. They also have a nice ocean smell to them. These would be perfect for all sorts of crafts. You can glue them around a picture frame, or even use them when making candles, you can neatly place them around a vase, seriously the list can go on and on let your imagination run wild.

"This child wizard hat is great. My son has been wearing it just about daily since we got it in the mail. It is a dark blue color with silver stars, moon, and trim. They are even sewn on securely so they won't come off. The silver trim is also padded which I believe helps the hat stay in place and fit perfectly without slipping off. It is made of felt and is easy to keep clean.  It's not heavy but stands up in the air just fine. It can also flap down if you want it to. it's a really a thin yet sturdy hat.

"This dry erase white magnetic sheet is one of my favorites. I have a small dry erase board that I have this up next to on the refrigerator. This makes leaving reminder messages easy. It's the size of a regular sheet of paper so I can write in a nice size to be able to see it from a distance so I don't forget about something important. I use it also for leaving reminders for my husband or kids if there is something I need them to know but can't tell them at the time. They know to check this sheet on the refrigerator.

"In this pack you get 3 inkjet printable business card magnetic sheets. They are pre-cut cards but they are still attached at least until you remove them into individual cards. You get a total of 10 per sheet so that makes 30 in total. I did take a star off because one sheet did have black scuff marks all over it and a few of the cards were already lifted off the sheet which I am sure would have messed up inside of my printer. However I believe that was just a fluke and don't think it will happen to others. The two good sheets worked perfectly. I instead of printing business cards I used them to print chores on. Each card has a different task on it and I place each card under my children's names for the day so they can see what they need to get done for the day. In my opinion this is so much better then a printed chore chart that you have to keep replacing. The quality of these are great. The magnets are great and hold up without a problem.

"These butterflies are awesome! There is so much detail in each one I am surprised at how lifelike they are. There is so much detail in the entire butterfly not just the wings but the body. There is a little magnet already on the inside of the butterfly and you can either place them flat on the wall or add a 3D touch and bend the wings a bit to make them look realistic like they are flying. The half yellow and half green are a happy medium. The two colors compliment each other and they look amazing together. I also think it's nice that they also gave you sheets of double sided tape circles so you can put them on the butterflies and place on your wall if you would like to have them where you don't have magnets. I absolutely love how beautiful they look. My daughter was very excited and happy when I opened the package to find an added bonus of a wonderful Frozen, Elsa sticker.

"Printable magnet sheets are great! With this set you get 5 sheets. I was curious how a project would turn out before getting a bunch of these magnet sheets so I was glad to be able to get a small set like this to use. I hate the empty sides of my refrigerator and I tried putting pictures using tape or magnets and they peel up from the sides or the magnets get knocked off by the kids and cat so this was my last option and I am very pleased with the results. I used these sheets to print out beautiful pictures and they stick perfectly to my refrigerator! The colors pop off the sheet.

"Technically, keeping legendary, emergency improviser Angus MacGyver in your glove box would be both inhumane and illegal but thankfully ""DBPOWER"" has developed a digital tire gage that performs many of the same functions including: glass-breaking hammer, seat-belt cutting blade, scissors and standard/Phillips screwdriver (all retractable swiss-army knife style) and last but not least a fairly respectable flashlight.  Oh ya, and it's also a digital tire gage (the reason most folks will buy I'm assuming) which includes 4 different measurement modes (PSI being one) with a contact that doesn't allow air to leak out in order to get an accurate reading and finally, there's a built in LED light just under said contact for taking a reading in poor lighting (e.g. at night or if perhaps you've been taken hostage by foreign spies and they're keeping you and your car in a dark warehouse and after making a daring escape you want to ensure there's enough air in the tires without tipping them off by turning on a light).Yes the ""9-in1"" gage is gimmicky but it also appears well-made and fairly durable and being roughly the size of a medium-sized flashlight, it can be easily stored both inconspicuously and within easy reach in your vehicle.

"Ya know, I've seen some unbelievably cheesy films on MST3K over the years but I can't recall ever watching one so abysmally boring (either Joel or Mike era) as ""Radar Secret Service"".  I can imagine moviegoers of the 1950's standing in line after leaving the theater, paying to be beaten silly with nerf-bats after enduring this snore-fest about G-men using what was apparently technology that had captured the public imagination at the time (i.e. radar) to foil the absolutely unintelligible plans of some gangsters; all are dressed in full suits (with hats) almost indistinguishable from one another, all drive REALLY big cars (one with a radar on top) and spend scene after scene in said cars driving through fields and pastures (and occasionally a city street) chasing each other and talking about radar... lots and lots of talking about radar.Mike and the bots do their utmost to make an episode out of ""Radar Secret Service"" but it's such an utterly vacuous film to begin with that their best couldn't get more than a couple of chuckles out of me (although I did enjoy the short).

"I'm always wary when I rent a horror flick (suddenly popping up in the streaming world out of nowhere) with opening credits that seem to insist it's both outstanding and highly anticipated.[Not-so-spoiler-lite synopsis] Two American adventure seekers (one of whom is so cool that he wears his stocking cap tilted back cowboy style) are on holiday in Exmoor (abbreviated to Xmoor in the title for added edginess) in the southwest of England to capture footage of a mysterious creature and win a $40K prize (which would totally allow them to go film other stuff in other places cuz filming is what they do).  Five minutes into their expedition they narrowly escape a pair of pranksters who project a flaming car at their VW microbus, THEN they arrive at a ruined cottage where they meet a strung-out survivor (she's actually strung out on drugs not like, strung out on fear) of an attack by the creature only to have the McGuffin twins suddenly reappear, assaulting the female adventure seeker and subsequently being chased off at gunpoint by their animal-tracking expert guide named Fox (hey, at least they didn't name him Wolf).  The team finally arrives at the forest of the alleged sightings as night falls thus allowing them to stumble upon a cache of dead bodies (traumatizing them almost beyond their emotional endurance) and a horrific discovery of the true nature of ""the beast"" (which is actually less horrific than a non-metaphor based ""beast"" would've been).I thought the subgenre switcheroo was clever but I gotta mention I find it off-putting in an age of sexual equality, when a horror movie feels the need to have the guys go into risk-their-lives mode for the woman on the team knowing full well she's gonna be the only survivor anyway (oops did I spoil... naaaah).  I was also a little disappointed to discover that the stocking cap sporting boyfriend who looked an awful lot like Lance Hunter from Agents of SHIELD was one-in-the-same actor Nick Blood which is I suppose a testament to the actor's versatility in pulling off such a spineless douche.Unfortunately there isn't a likeable character for miles in this story that's so busy it ends up being a hot mess (I hate clichs but there it is), making ""The Beast of Xmoor"" a movie I wouldn't watch a second time... or even a first time had I known about its inherent hot-messness qualities in advance.  :o)","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK03I35HI22V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S1UGU2#wasThisHelpful","R3QK03I35HI22V","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a tale from the DC multi-verse centered on a Superman who is the son of general Zod, a Wonderwoman that is the granddaughter of Highfather and Batman as a vampire.On the plus side we get more of the wonderful animation we've come to expect from the Warner Bros. animation studios and a very engaging story including lots of great characters.  On the downside, I think it's a shame that DC Comics feels the need to pepper their animated films with gratuitous profanity and graphic violence, personally I don't think it fits the franchise as we don't see it in the comics (usually) or the live-action films.  Whether I'm watching anime or domestically produced animation ""mature"" content just feels more adolescent than adult in this medium and I really wish the studio would dial it back to PG.All that aside, I thought ""Justice League: Gods and Monsters"" was decidedly better than some of the other animated films the studio's been churning out lately (looking at you ""War"" and ""Son of Batman"") featuring slightly more thoughtful dialogue and again a pretty interesting story from start to finish.  :o)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTZWIHUG6MTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ6K78S#wasThisHelpful","R2OTZWIHUG6MTD","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""True Story"" is a riveting mystery/drama about a man accused of a heinous crime that, through the strangest of circumstances, develops a relationship with a successful journalist from within prison.This film is guaranteed to keep the viewer completely engaged via a refreshingly unpredictable story that helps one to remain on the edge of their seat and in the dark till almost the final moments.  Is alleged murderer Christian Longo (James Franco) an innocent man trying desperately to cover for someone else or is he a cold-hearted psychopath?  Is journalist Michael Finkel (Johah Hill) simply an opportunist with a keyboard exploiting the misery of others to write a successful novel or is he himself being cleverly manipulated?  Franco plays the part of a mysterious prisoner haunted by his past par excellence while Hill portrays the keen journalist and confidante with credibility and their peculiar relationship unfolds, along with the events surrounding Longo's upcoming trial, through a series of remarkable scenes including a climactic and revealing confrontation between Franco and Finkel's wife, played by Felicity Jones.I was a little surprised when I saw Brad Pitt's name in the credits under associate producer however I suppose it just goes to show the talent behind such an excellent, modern thriller and I highly recommend you ignore the critics and give this one a rent (particularly if you're a Franco fan like myself).  :o)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMV6KBL0DRR73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYXV776#wasThisHelpful","RMV6KBL0DRR73","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a sleepy little monster flick with elements of a disaster movie that maintains a fairly respectable creepy factor right out of the gate.Kevin Durand plays a grieving parent who is also tasked with being the sheriff of a small town plagued by recent encounters with a mysterious animal that does stuff like chase off the local wildlife, leave strange footprints all over town and occasionally engage in breaking and entering.  The police force, consisting of Durand and a deputy (played by Lukas Haas), spend the majority of the film investigating while the creature furtively harasses the townsfolk and brutally kills any animals that didn't have the sense to bail all the while building some legitimate suspense.""Dark was the Night"" features a remarkably good cast (kudos to the casting director) with special emphasis on Durand and Haas who are what I considered to be the film's greatest strength.  Unfortunately, the production team didn't seem to have had adequate funds for populating the small town with extras making it feel strangely deserted, and add to that a noticeable lack of scene-padding dialogue or ambient noise in general, other than scoring of the variety that Crow T. Robot once referred to as a ""Yanni lick"", all making this movie feel like it had taken a healthy dose of Ambien.In spite of moving at a snail's pace, it's a fairly engaging horror with some decent jump moments but I would point out that the creature itself is better left unseen as it turns out to be fully CGI and well... let's just say they must've hired the same FX studio that Syfy channel uses.  I would recommend it for a rental but please don't expect a non-stop action-packed thrill-ride and you shouldn't be disappointed. :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDFCR8PH8OEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FEZFFU#wasThisHelpful","R1FDFCR8PH8OEP","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ethan, Nick, Chris and Andrew are four, at large thrill-seekers with an obsession for practical jokes; in fact they have their very own successful web series called ""Prankmasters"".  Unfortunately, as is the case with so many habitual smart-asses, they have a hard time knowing when enough is enough and after the cool/handsome member of the group (i.e. Ethan) gets married the remaining three decide to use his honeymoon as an opportunity to play a cabin-in-the-woods/home-invasion ultimate prank.  Time spent with the guys however slowly begins to reveal they walk a fine line between being playfully juvenile and socially dysfunctional and when the elaborately staged joke fails miserably the situation becomes deadly.Employing a relatively unique theme for an indie horror, ""The Jokesters"" features top-notch production values and a likable cast who succeeded in conveying the profound awkwardness of the initial situation and had me invested in the story by the time it cleverly descended into terror.

The buttons (skip/play volume and phone) are large enough and distinct in shape so that you can feel them with your fingers (Braille style) and I prefer an actual power switch over a button (making it more difficult to leave on accidentally) with a blue LED light as a reminder.

"It seems as if Syfy has finally come to terms with their own identity; one which doesn't include qualities like originality, creativity or being on the cutting edge of anything in particular but rather one for sampling, splicing and b-grade production values in general which makes ""Killjoys"" refreshing in that it's unpretentious and without delusions of grandeur (looking at you Defiance).The first question that came to mind while watching the pilot episode (free btw... thanks amazon) was where the heck did they find their lead actress?  Aside from being slightly gorgeous, Hannah John-Kamen can act and then there's her sidekick played by Aaron Ashmore (twin brother of X-men's Shawn Ashmore) both of whom definitely sell their roles as space bounty hunters, unfortunately it's stuff like sets, props, the underwear model playing their third partner and not to mention the plot that are all just so frigg'n bleh.  Look, I get that this show prolly doesn't have a stellar budget but I mean come one... 80's era Doctor Who had more science fiction ambiance than Killjoys making the latter feel more like a slightly futuristic action/drama and not a particularly interesting one at that.I honestly can't imagine a snooze-fest like this ever seeing a 2nd season but then again I've been wrong before... either way here's hoping Syfy will use these two talented actors on other (better) future shows.  :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUANJ4GGCHO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI29KKM#wasThisHelpful","R1PUANJ4GGCHO7","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start off by confessing that a little comedy goes a long way with me, however I am a Jim Gaffigan fan and so when I read that TV Land was producing a sitcom starring said comedian I just had to check it out.Episode 1 introduces the viewer to Gaffigan (as himself) his wife (Ashley Williams) and 5 kids along with a BFF (Adam Goldberg) as well as the parish priest (Tongayi Chirisa).  The ""Super Great Daddy"" is home from a tour and moderately enthused about getting involved in the daily household routine but it quickly becomes apparent that this isn't exactly his forte (putting it mildly).If you're familiar with Gaffigan then you know his standup is usually pretty PG but please be aware that this series might swing just a smidgen in the more mature category, albeit tastefully mature as he certainly doesn't specialize in raunchy in-your-face style humor. Although scripted (Gaffigan and wife are actually co-writers) it has a slightly improvisational feel (more ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" than ""Big Bang Theory"") in keeping with the slice-of-life theme and I'll be interested to see if they change the scene-transition music (or eliminate it altogether) because a busy episode means a fair amount of the only aspect of the show I didn't care for.Overall this felt very ""lived-in"" for a pilot, which certainly bodes well for the season and Gaffigan seems completely at ease in front of the television camera (not to mention he's frigg'n hilarious) and although his character is a comic portrayal of the not-so-ideal father he's definitely no Peter Griffin and consequently the humor centers more on the awkward than the absurd and I also found it refreshing that the family's religious beliefs figure prominently into their daily routine (OSV actually did an article on it) in a way that struck me as very natural (possibly even hip).Again, very entertaining pilot and if the season builds on the character of the original then I think TV Land is definitely making an improvement on the climate of television sitcoms.  :o)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYEI2WU7RXMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105SRFMM#wasThisHelpful","R3DYEI2WU7RXMY","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a familiar story... soldier returns from war to find his father's passed and the love of his life has moved on... oh, did I mention the conflict in question would be a little something we call the American Revolutionary War and this guy was on the losing side?Remember that super-hunky dwarf from Peter Jackson's recent Hobbit films (i.e. Kili played by Aidan Turner)?  Well now said actor has assumed the role of Ross Poldark, the war veteran mentioned above as well as the sole inheritor of an estate in ruin (including its debt) along with a generally ne'er-do-well reputation to live down.  What he does have going for him is a serious case of self-reliance, razor-sharp wit and enough determination to begin fixing up said inheritance (including a couple of abandoned mines) while taking time to lend a helping hand to a local urchin played by Eleanor Tomlinson (""Jack the Giant Slayer"").Now if you've watched the season preview you learn the latter is a prospective love interest which I suspect will be the central theme drawing the majority of viewers (i.e. late 18th century romance) but for those not as excited about that aspect (myself included) I would point out that ""Poldark"" is a well-filmed, well-written (as it's based on a series of popular novels) period drama with an exceptional cast (emphasis on Turner and Tomlinson) and a revitalization story combined with a bit of liberation theme (in keeping with the protagonists view of the war) within a very class-bound setting, all of which works in creating what I thought was a very engaging first episode.TNT may claim to ""know drama"" but I think that Masterpiece Theater, in conjunction with the BBC, has a more distinguished and certainly longer history and ""Poldark"" is definitely another fine entry in that tradition. :o)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SC8EI0P7ZB07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z61S75S#wasThisHelpful","R1SC8EI0P7ZB07","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the right hands the found footage method can yield some outstanding horror.  In the wrong hands we get a movie like ""Day of the Mummy"" which features lots of Egyptology sounding, made up stuff along with all the standard F.F. tropes of juvenile infighting, dialogue that relies on f**k for sentence structure, characters that could literally be dropped within just about any story setting and still lack credibility (Danny Glover in the standard Lance Henriksen role is embarrassingly bad and his acting is by far the best), etc., although I will grudgingly admit that the glasses/camera with a live feed was a cool innovation but not enough to give this stinker more than 1 star.I suggest you punch that nagging curiosity to rent ""Day of the Mummy"" squarely in the nose and wait for it to go Prime or Netflix.  :o)","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VB39ZIAZ5K5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGWL6QO#wasThisHelpful","R1VB39ZIAZ5K5H","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a horror movie world populated by mutants, aliens and werewolves we sometimes forget that the plain-old animals inhabiting our own national forests can be pretty, darn deadly.It's a relatively simple story; a couple from the city decides to take a weekend hiking trip at a nearby, national park... the guy gets in a little over his head trying to impress his girlfriend and they end up becoming lost.  This is a pretty decent drama based on nothing more than the interplay between the pair as they deal with a survival situation but I liked the added tension early on with the introduction of a territorial, tour guide providing a sort of clue to just how unprepared the male protagonist is at being the alpha.I honestly can't think of another film using bears as ""monsters"" other than 1966's ""The Night of the Grizzly"" or 1979's ""Prophecy"" (technically a mutant bear) and so first off I give writer/director Adam MacDonald props for originality as well as casting actors that give some very credible performances helping the viewer to really get in the moment of this relatively slow-building thriller.  Also, horror fans will recognize a nod to ""You're Next"" as the Meat Loaf-esque song from said film is playing on the radio during the trip to the park (which I sincerely hope is a coincidence rather than a potential convention indie producers will use for foreshadowing).  And just as a side note, please don't think this is some Syfy style of animal-gone-wild flick because the black bear is 100% real with zero CGI (that I could tell anyway) and so I also have to applaud this film for some excellent and extremely realistic choreography with a dang scary animal.At 92 minutes ""Backcountry"" features: cinematography easy on the eyes, a story that is relatively simple but well-executed, decent rewatchability factor, minimal gore and a remarkable under reliance on ""adult"" language (minus the occasional f-bomb) and is a great candidate for a movie-night rental.  :o)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUHDMZHQYCNM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYKXY54#wasThisHelpful","RUHDMZHQYCNM5","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Something Wicked"" is a sort of mindbender (possessing elements of horror) with a promising beginning including not only an allusion to Macbeth in the title but some fairly sophisticated Hitchockian opening credits followed by a quote from Aristotle, which all seem to indicate some fairly high-brow drama.Unfortunately, the suspenseful beginning and plot-twisted finale are like incoherent bookends of a slightly schizophrenic narrative whose sole purpose seems to be providing a vehicle for perving over Shantel van Santen (""Final Destination 4"") best exemplified by a heavy dose of leer-cam, soft & squishy love interest (that keeps turning up in scenes unexpectedly), her brother (whose hobbies include window-peeking, philandery, watching his sister crack flossing with a lacy thong, etc.,), love interests' disturbed coworker (assisted by a creepy, mask-wearing sibling with a special power I call ""dream giggling"") and pretty much everyone else (almost looked like co-star Brittany Murphy was going down that road at one point as well).This one has decent production values and will certainly keep you engaged while trying to figure out exactly what the heck is going on but in the final analysis (and I mean that literally) I think the characters in this story (or possibly it was the actors portraying them) might be better suited to a film with either Scream in the title or bom-chicka-wow-wow in the background, because they felt really out of place in something trying to be a clever, psychological thriller (ironically resulting in the train wreck at the beginning becoming a sort of metaphor for what follows).  :o)","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKZN2SG241OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPJDS42#wasThisHelpful","R2JKZN2SG241OY","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That was one of the many riffs on the gardener character (they dub Eric Clapton without pants) fairly early on that had me laughing for about 3 minutes.Where to begin, this episode was mega-funny beginning with a short starring no less than Gumbi featuring lots of hard and fast zingers that had me chuckling from the get-go (provides inspiration for a later skit) and portended great things to come.  The feature ""The Screaming Skull"" doesn't disappoint... at first that is, this one drags in the middle (due to some seriously uneventful scenes) which doesn't keep Mike and the bots from valiantly trudging through and helping this one to be fairly entertaining from start to finish.

"Musical tastes for both the area I live and the business where I work range from country/western to western/country and consequently when I listen to classical or jazz it's like scratching a chalkboard to my coworkers and so I've been thinking about buying a pair of Bluetooth earbuds and it just so happened along came an offer from Soundpeats audio for a pair of their ""Q8 Wireless Sports Earphone"" in exchange for an honest review.What's in the box (a very cool little box I might add): 2 earbuds (L & R clearly marked) with rubber ear cushions and hooks (extra set provided) so these puppies ain't falling out anytime soon, attached by a small but sturdy cable (21"" when laid out flat) including a recharge port cleverly hidden in the right speaker and the controls (multi-function/sound+/-) are also part of the cable.  Additionally, I received the microphone complete with plastic ear attachment (for pairing with a cell-phone).Use is fairly intuitive and setup is simple in keeping with the simplicity of the device itself.  Place the left speaker in your ear (leaving the right one out to facilitate access to the controls) and press the multi-function button for approximately 5 seconds at which point a female, British voice announces ""Power on"" (accompanied by LED lights); approximately 2 seconds longer prompts the ""pairing"" mode (at which time you pair it with your device) and of course if you press the button again for 5 seconds it's ""power off"".  I'm writing this only from the perspective of listening to music via my Kindle Fire (I'm not interested in the calling options) and I thought the sound quality was excellent (approx. 50' range), volume control for the earbuds (used in conjunction with that on your device) conveniently provides a beep when you max either way.  I have found recharging is necessary with approximately 6 hrs. of continual use (there's also an audible reminder when the battery is low) and involves powering the buds down, plugging it in to the USB cable provided, at which point the LED lights red, blue indicates it's fully charged.Kudos to Soundpeats for such an excellently well-crafted, stylish and mega EZPZ to use Bluetooth headset that I absolutely love and have already recommended to several friends.  :o)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3036QYA31ZAPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RE0KUOK#wasThisHelpful","R3036QYA31ZAPQ","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It sure would be cool if at some point one of these movies would give us at least one scientific character so we could get a little insight into what's going on (sequels are usually known for that) but instead we get a bunch of tools radiating testosterone and blowing up stuff (when they're not screaming or crying) all the while the camera is flailing chaotically to help the viewer ""feel"" the action... oh, and there's also some excellent CGI aliens usually off in the background which is prolly the only reason anyone would watch this in the first place.""Dark Continent"" obviously had a decent budget but unlike the first film, everyone in this one sucks... and by that I mean everyone, so that in the end I honestly didn't give a rats pajamas whether these ""defenders of Earth"" defeated any aliens and when the last 30 minutes introduced a sort of ""Dances with Wolves"" bonding-with-the-natives in an effort to engender sympathy, it was too little too late.

"Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China is a historical crossroads of cultures (having also been part of the Silk Road) and is currently experiencing, as part of the larger country's industrial revolution, the transition of a society on a course to modernity which inspired photojournalist Ryan Pyle to visually document this cultural time-capsule that will soon be gone.Beginning with a frenzied mix of urban marketplaces, the author shifts to the religious climate (predominantly Muslim) as the faithful in fur hats attend austere mosques leading into a contrast between archaic housing and the modern, earthquake resistant high-rises and office buildings (e.g. a child stands at the door of a very old house while new buildings line the opposite street on page 88-89) being constructed by workers looking as if they belong to a distant past.  The author then focuses on the culture's economic infrastructure beginning with pastoralism (pgs. 122-141) followed by artisans at work in traditional factories (featuring some of the more remarkable photography in my opinion) and then finally concluding the journey with pilgrimages though haunting desert landscapes.Kudos to author and photographer Ryan Pyle for this finely crafted, self-published title to which I give four stars for a fascinating tour of this unique culture as well as the inherent value of a visual record for future historians.  On the downside, considering that this is a completely visual look inside the culture, I didn't find the pictures for the most part particularly inspired... I mean yes, they're certainly better than what one would expect from tourists, but there was nothing that really captured the emotions of the changes taking place (apart from the happy little family on pages 86-87) nor stirred my own.I believe this book would be of value to those interested in this particular region of China as well as a contemporary study on the social effects of modernization, and I think it's a fine effort on the part of the author and I can honestly say I'm looking forward to future projects.

This episode features some average riffing and occasional bursts of prolonged yucks with special emphasis on: working-the-gold-mine montage, the appearance of ""Pile-on Pete"" (who works as a ""lawn-gnome in the summertime"") and a post-attempted-murder of Lassie consolation of Tommy scene.I would mention the skits were fairly entertaining, especially when Dr. Forrester converts Frank's heart into a generator, but unfortunately I just didn't think this episode rated any higher than a 3 star so I'd recommend you rent before buying.  :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6XWBRCR5RDLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SPOT2IY#wasThisHelpful","R6XWBRCR5RDLK","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a copy of ""How Angels Die"" (written by Guy Blews) in exchange for an honest review.This is a thought-provoking work about a very weighty subject focusing on one woman's struggle with MS eventually leading to her committing the very act that her boyfriend had so flippantly reserved for himself, ironically causing him to value life a bit more.  As the narrator, he moves from a sort of nihilistic philosophy of ""I did not see the goodness in this world, I simply saw the pointless...  I know that life does not matter, but while I am here, I am determined it should be easy"" to discovering a love he was reluctant to part with eventually leading to a sort of faith in human emotion: ""Hope is the one thing that keeps humans alive, it is the intangible product of life that allows us to suffer interminably without giving up"".The author possesses an engaging writing style that took me through the pages of a relatively depressing story and to his credit I felt like I really got to know these characters; but having gotten to know them I found I didn't particularly care for the contempt with which they tended to view those around them.  Also, I guess I was hoping for some redemptive quality or some moral to the story but instead it's tragedy without reprieve and although the narrator seems to have a change of heart regarding the value of a human life I suspect the author's intent was to teach a ""lesson"" to all those that think suicide is fundamentally wrong.I know this may sound a little clinical but it reflects the detachment I felt for the characters when I say that ""How Angels Die"" is a decent study in the motivations behind what drives one to commit suicide and the effects it can have on even the ultra-cynical.  :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKMDOJYUXN2OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0A0RIM#wasThisHelpful","RKMDOJYUXN2OT","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the record I'm not a fan of either the franchise mentioned in my title or writer/director Adam Green but I thought the preview for ""Digging up the Marrow"" looked pretty cool and I also noticed it had a actor in it I like (Ray Wise) so I figured I'd give it a shot.[spoiler-lite synopsis] A horror movie director (Green as himself) is contacted by an eccentric, retired detective (Wise) who claims to have tangible evidence that monsters actually exist and, in spite of the former's commitment to an upcoming, new television series, he simply can't resist the urge to grab his cameraman/partner and pay the guy a visit (recording it all in the FF style of course).  At first the duo suspect their new associate is completely delusional however he eventually takes them out monster hunting and after having a first-hand encounter, Green subsequently develops an insatiable desire for more, and more until...Aside from a central theme of the dangers inherent in chasing monsters, there's a mystery sub-plot (that's fairly transparent) adding some depth to the narrative which unfortunately doesn't help ""Digging up the Marrow"" avoid being mostly unsatisfying as horror in that the prevailing, lighthearted style seriously undermines any attempt at generating the necessary atmosphere.  Also, Green never shuts up (a fact which Wise actually comments on at one point) and considering he dominates screen-time, this movie almost felt like one, big selfie (with the occasional monster) and I can't help wondering what might've been if the writer (again... Green) had went more for creature/slasher/survival than pseudo-documentary.Although rocking some excellent creature FX, this movie ultimately left me flat and I personally couldn't see myself watching it again or really even remembering it two months from now.

"Ok, if you can make it through the pervy opening credits (with its 80's synth music) you'll find a relatively clever b-grade (but not low-budget) slasher that is a sort of cautionary tale of a sleezy hobby gone horribly wrong.[spoiler-lite synopsis] The titular Girl House is a sort of Playboy Mansion for internet porn complete with plush accommodations, security guards and 24-hour surveillance, to provide the cyber audience with all the slice of life details they hunger for.  The viewer receives a whirlwind tour of the biz from the perspective of its newest girl (and central protagonist) Kylie, whose jaw-dropping debut is met with enthusiasm as she owns the mbps, including a devoted regular known as Loverboy.  Apparently, this particular fanboy spends so much cyber-time in the house that all the girls are a little affectionate towards him, however after seeing Kylie he falls in love and consequently makes the mistake of uploading his own rather disappointing pic to her pc, which another not-so-nice coworker spreads around thus makes LB a laughing stock.  This embarrassing event, along with being sexually bullied as a child and recently humiliated by a hot secretary for his workplace leering, causes a snap in his already tenuous mental stability and that's where the film (53 minutes in BTW) begins the descent into legit horror, and I mean big-time as LB (now sporting a creepy mask) breaks into G.H. and subsequently hacks and maims his way through its terrified residents.""Girl House"" gives us a killer both legitimately dangerous and pathetic who engages in some relatively creative (and moderately gory) kills and, as you can imagine, there's no shortage of T&A from a very attractive cast (all of whom can act) along with a bit of comedy relief provided by Kylie's love interest's BFF (who loves porn... if you can believe it) and ""Gotham"" fans will also recognize Camren Bicondova (Catgirl) as the bully from the killer's origin story.

"The peril of watching Nickelodeon with kids around Christmas time is that almost every commercial contains something they absolutely must have.  One of these perilous advertisements was for a cotton candy maker (with glow in the dark sticks) that we all agreed  looked mega-cool, but after doing a little research the consensus was to avoid that particular model.Further research eventually brought me to the Nostalgia Electrics Cotton Candy Maker and long story short, my nieces had a blast with it on Christmas Eve and several times since.

"Ok, so maybe ""Frankenstein Vs. the Mummy"" doesn't have the pageantry of a Hammer film or the entertainment value of a Universal monster flick but neither is it a stinky, low-budget cheese-festival.[mild-spoiler synopsis]  Victor Frankenstein is a professor (of medicine?) at an unnamed university and practices reanimation as a hobby; a fellow professor and close, personal friend is Dr. Naihla Khalil an Egyptologist who has recently been part of an expedition which discovered the mummified remains of a 3,000 year-old pharaoh.  Oh ya, did I mention that they're in love, cuz you're gonna spend a fair amount of time with these two talking, dining, shagging, etc., but it's all part of getting to know the two central characters; one with noble aspirations the other not so much.  After being forced to murder a gross body-snatcher (and steal his brain), Frankenstein completes his monster (yes... they managed to squeeze in ""it's alive!"") who is strangely reminiscent of Regan from the exorcist's head on a professional wrestlers body; the mummy just needs the heart of a nave undergrad and he's good to go.  Both are evil, both have superhuman strength and both (as with so many monster movies) are smitten with the pretty girl and when they collide (last 11 minutes BTW) it's a fairly cool monster brawl that unfortunately doesn't last long.Be aware ""FVM"" does rock some fairly convincing gore that occasionally had me cringing (this is coming from someone who watches tons of horror) but overall it's a cool premise for a modern B-grade monster flick and is it just me or does anyone else think these classic monsters would make great candidates for slasher movies?  :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4HZM84A313H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF84PFY#wasThisHelpful","R2R4HZM84A313H","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So you know all those horror movies where they call in a priest to see if a place is haunted and he tells them something like ""the church will need to investigate these claims to see if they're real""... well, this is a story about one of those teams actually engaged in fieldwork.[Mild-spoiler synopsis] Deacon (played by Gordon Kennedy from BBC's ""Robin Hood"") is a paranormal investigator for the Vatican and is joined by a snarky tech guy and a no-nonsense priest to look into a potential miracle at a small 13th century church that has been recently re-opened for the first time in over a century by one Father Crellick.  In spite of experiencing some strange phenomena during the investigation they decide to declare the situation a hoax until the resident priest commits suicide; an event which causes Deacon to question his own skepticism and provokes a decision to conduct another investigation.... at night.  After being literally scared out of the place (and this guy is no coward), Deacon decides to call in an expert on church history and the supernatural (one Father Calvino) and upon their return to the church things completely go to hell (and I don't mean that just figuratively).Technically ""Final Prayer"" is found footage as the entire narrative plays through a multitude of personal and strategically placed cameras however it defies the subgenre by first of all employing bona-fide grown up and professional actors and secondly by writing the characters being portrayed so that even in spite of clashing personalities they ultimately have to cooperate.  I found it to be a subtle but effectively spooky supernatural horror that is also a fairly clever mystery to boot and I would definitely recommend it for a rental.

"What started out in 2014 as an under-the-radar, summer series has apparently garnered enough popularity in the U.K. and abroad for BBC America to not only produce a second season but place it toe-to-toe with all the domestic heavy-hitters in the second half of Winter season 2014/2015.Although very entertaining, season one was at times balanced on a knife's edge of becoming a vehicle for action-stunts and clichd one-liners however the narrative seems to have moved past things like D'artagnan's adolescent desire to become a musketeer or over-the-top, fork dueling and looks as if the story arc is swinging more towards large-scale political intrigue.  Producers Adrian Hodges and Jessica Pope continue to cultivate a big-screen feel (special emphasis on episode 2 ""An Ordinary Man""), while the writers are bringing a slightly more mature tenor (less the overreliance on ""adult"" content) and If anyone's wondering what happened to Peter Capaldi (a.k.a. Cardinal Richelieu) he's conveniently and mysteriously died between seasons as the BBC pulled him over to Doctor Who (helping to get the last few nails in that coffin).Following the events of episode 12 from the previous season, Milady de Winter (heavy on villain short on seductress) is back with a vengeance creating scheming subplots, there's also a welcome addition of Marc Warren as Comte de Rochefort (giving a slightly unhinged performance), King Louis (Ryan Gage) is moving from buffoonery to legitimate tyranny and although I said it when I reviewed the first season, I'll reemphasize that the four guys playing the musketeers have some real chemistry and it's just a pleasure to tag along on their adventures.I'm not the BBC fan I used to be, however I'm definitely along for the ride on Musketeers and I still say this show has the coolest opening credits of anything on TV.[Update 3/22/15]  An epic, exciting and at times bittersweet finale has rounded up this exceptional second season of The Musketeers and may I say I'm even more devoted to this series than I was when I posted my initial review.  There were some very remarkable scenes in episode 10 ""Trial and Punishment"" that reemphasize the thoughtful writing and creative energy invested in this show and I'm very glad to hear that BBC America will be renewing for a third season.  :o)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBY34M92EXCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM3UJSG#wasThisHelpful","R2NBY34M92EXCA","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Thriller"" was a suspense-drama of the anthology variety that ran on NBC from 1960 to 1962 and was hosted by legendary horror actor Boris Karloff.  Ya, that's great and all but here's what you need to know; when the episodes focused on murder-mystery it was reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock Presents but when it focused on horror... Whoa!!Something about black & white raises the creepy factor anyway and the stories were typically inspired and  captivating (""Child's Play"" being an exception) and although I would recommend the entire season  the following episodes are particularly remarkable:  ""The Purple Room"" which is a good haunted house, ""The Watcher"" a suspenseful slasher, ""The Hungry Glass"" a paranormal tale about a vengeful house, ""The Devil's Ticket"" fairly self-explanatory, ""The Terror in Teakwood"" a supernatural story of morbid obsession, ""Dark Legacy"" occult thriller, ""Pigeons from Hell"" one of the best haunted house shows you'll ever watch and finally ""The Grim Reaper"" which stars William Shatner in a dang good supernatural story about an evil painting.Be aware that this is NOT the entire series (there are 30 more episodes) and hopefully Amazon will eventually make season 2 available for streaming soon but in case you're eager for the complete set then check out Thriller: The Complete Series.  :o)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J833MO8LI8BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047JV3YM#wasThisHelpful","R1J833MO8LI8BA","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a mystery investigation show that distinguishes itself from so many others by engaging more in finding evidence than in endless speculation or bombarding our senses with historical recreations, shaky cameras in backwoods areas chasing ""what was that... did you hear that"", foreboding music, medieval art etc.Brothers Jim and Bill Vieira make no pretense at being anything more than amateur investigators (they're actually professional stone-masons) but what they lack in formal credentials they make up for in zeal and an uncanny ability to maintain focus on their primary goal which is to obtain tangible evidence of giant human remains in North America.  I find it refreshing how they constantly submit their findings to professional geologists, anthropologists, forensic professionals and a host of other giant-hunting enthusiasts and that they include the viewing audience in their research of historical documents rather than simply saying what they learned.""Search for the Lost Giants"" certainly stimulates the imagination as well as piques the adventurous spirit in us all and the payoff is that we actually get some results and even learn a bit about our nation's more obscure history.

"It's 2033 A.D., just ten years after the USDF (United Space Defense Force) successfully repels an invasion from outer space leaving behind only a few pockets of alien resistance.  Unfortunately, more than a decade of peace has not only produced planet-wide memory loss, in that outposts which once provided defense are now largely abandoned, but once again Earth's resident population begins to turn on one another.IFC Midnight delivers a visually remarkable and fairly original indie sci-fi, combining a sort of war docudrama with space invasion that's told largely from a pair of embedded journalist's point of view.  Battle scenes are surprisingly realistic, aliens are large, heavily armored reptiles that look pretty darn cool, however the story itself is relatively unimpressive (more like an episode from a weekly television series).  Also, not much in the way of sympathetic characters or heroes to root for in ""Alien Outpost""; basically war-weary, cynical and ill-tempered soldiers in a desperate, combat situation that kinda made me think ""if this is humanity's last, best hope... think I'll join the aliens"".  :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KTN3VY4G97E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SY9PS9W#wasThisHelpful","R35KTN3VY4G97E","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly middling Joel Era episode where the majority of really good riffing escalates during like the last 20 minutes of the film along with Peter Breck's (Nick from The Big Valley) hammy over-acting; not a bad episode mind you... just a bit on the slow side.  As one might imagine there's more than a few Howl references, the fusion of opening theme to The Jetsons and the big-band score towards the end was hilarious, the timid little hotel manager almost doesn't need help from the bots and I think it's worth mentioning that Joel gets most of the laughs on this one (for a change) and Magic Voice is a pre-Pearl Mary Jo Pehl. :o)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SF530CPTK14Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HIHZ1O#wasThisHelpful","R1SF530CPTK14Y","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Helen may have been the face that launched a thousand ships but she's plain as a paper bag next to the mega-hot Achilles played by Brad Pitt, who in this film (at age 40) is the definitive rock-star, radiating more sheer sex-appeal and charisma than a night at the Grammys and absolutely convincing as the deadliest warrior on the Mediterranean.""Troy"" may not be the most reliable source for gaining a deeper understanding of Homer's masterpiece; the battles don't possess a fraction of the Iliad's brilliance while most of the heroes are omitted (including my fav Diomedes) not to mention the Trojan horse is technically in the Odyssey etc., but make no mistake it IS a visually gorgeous, historical epic with just a dash of fantasy thrown in.  It is also the performance of a lifetime, featuring a gorgeous and talented movie-star in the prime of life which parallels (albeit on a smaller scale) the character being portrayed, thus lending legitimate hubris and helping ""Troy"" transcend what would've otherwise been a fairly mediocre production and maybe even pushes it towards a modern classic (although Leonard Maltin would prolly never say that).  :o)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CGEBI6IIIUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001N4OX82#wasThisHelpful","R4CGEBI6IIIUT","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Stylistically ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" (2014) is a sort of homage horror that combines 70's fashions (monochrome, polyester pant-suits and butterfly collars) in a 2013 setting, and includes some horror alumni's such as Veronica Cartwright (""Alien"", ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"") and Danielle Harris (""Halloween IV"", V, etc.,).More than just a slasher, this film adds legitimate suspense in the form of a high-profile murder investigation but where it really shines is in the acting (not a single b-movie performance to be found) with special emphasis on the main protagonist (Addison Timlin) who, in keeping with the general attempt at recreating a 70's feel, kinda reminded me of a young Margot Kidder.  The gore is more on the subtle side as opposed to shock-fest whereas the dialogue demonstrates a shocking dearth of profanity and although there's some shagging, the scenes are plot-driven rather than gratuitous given the killer typically likes to do his thing while folks are doing theirs.  Memorable Sundown scenes include: re-creation of a famous kill from the original 1976 film, woman with a compound fracture hunted down in a motel parking lot, love interest being stalked while walking through a series of motion-sensor lights and the final chase between the heroine and the killer (can I call him ""sack-head""?).You don't need to be a fan of the original to enjoy this sequel; it's an excellent stand-alone movie and is also further evidence that 2014 was a dang good year for domestic horror.  :o)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARPS9ODCMSXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLI8FIQ#wasThisHelpful","RARPS9ODCMSXA","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2011 DC Comics initiated the ""New 52"" reboot of all their titles including Aquaman, a superhero that previously seemed like a fish out water (pun intended), and anyone who read that first issue had to pick their jaw up off the floor (I remember my fav comic store being constantly sold out) seeing this reinvigorated character leaping through the city streets (Incredible Hulk style) and basically looking and being awesome.  A prevalent theme for said comic has been the struggle for Atlantis which is also the driving force behind 2015's ""Throne of Atlantis"".This film is a sequel to ""Justice League: War"" however the two couldn't be further apart, a fact best demonstrated by the ""rebooted"" following themes: Shazaam is awesome again and his nose is no longer nestled between Cyborgs cheeks (not so much anyway), Lantern is voiced by Nathan Fillion (which all alone improves the overall quality of the character and the film in general), Superman and Wonderwoman actually engage in grown-up dialogue (not to mention a scene with Diana rock'n the hot bespectacled look) and I thought it was cool how they tried to recreate the magic of a now legendary kiss made famous by issue 12 of Justice League, the repartee between Lantern and Batman is entertaining as opposed to inane and we get the feeling that once again Earth is being protected by bona fide grown-ups as opposed to clich-spouting, not-particularly-intelligent pre-teens.Considering there are no less than 8 phenomenal superheroes (9 if you include Mera) in this film, not to mention all the Atlantean celebrities, I think that director Ethan Spaulding and screenwriter Heath Corson did an excellent job bringing a bit of depth, development and not to mention some legitimate wit across the board to these characters, which is especially impressive given the scope of the story and the 70 minute run-time.  I also appreciated how the forces of Atlantis were presented as being legitimately formidable and even capable of defeating the JL in a contest of brute force causing the latter to lean towards strategy.  I would actually put ""TOA"" on a par with ""Flashpoint Paradox"" when it comes to an engaging story and regarding visuals, basically it's the exceptional character rendering from ""War"" and the flawless animation sequences except this one was written for adults as opposed to... whoever ""War"" was written for (need to delete that one from my library) and I also wanna mention that composer Frederick Wiedmann gives us a pretty darn good score for a direct-to-video animated, action movie.I suspect you can tell that I thoroughly enjoyed ""TOA"" and again... all the more so considering its prequel was so incredibly bad, but the sequel is easily a stand-alone flick (particularly if you're a DC fan) and I just gotta say that it reaffirms my love, bordering on unhealthy obsession, for all things DC.  :o)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PS7A10QOEIVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDCCJP4#wasThisHelpful","R3PS7A10QOEIVO","A277UC8WJVAIIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277UC8WJVAIIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was kindly supplied this item free of charge to test and evaluate. In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts.  This is said review.These are nice headphones - but they aren't my favorite.  I can only compare them to the Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones which I love.  These are okay, and for the price I'd say they are good, but they are definitely not noise cancelling.  Besides that, these headphones have a great quality of sound, very clear, crisp sound.  There are two things I don't like about these headphones, one being the ear cushions are completely flat -- they don't curve to the shape of your head at all.  And the second one is the +/-  volume button does not turn the volume up and down when these are plugged in to my computer.  I have to press either the up or down (+/-) volume buttons on the cord at least 5 or 6 times to get the volume to click once.  Not sure if this is a defective cord or what the issue is, but it is not nearly as responsive as I would expect since it does not turn the volume up or down with each time the + or - buttons on the cord are pressed.I do really like the style and the sleek look of these headphones and the case they come in.

Very pleased with this bulb.______________Made by: TGMSize: G14 4W=40W(1Pack)Color: Soft WhiteASIN: B00YCCV26IProvided for review by: TGM LEDShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23I2GKKX1VC5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCCV26I#wasThisHelpful","R23I2GKKX1VC5M","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are awesome little lights.  They actually were able to blink right out of the box even though I hadn't put the solar panel in the sun yet -- although I turned them off and let them charge before testing the blinking settings.  These worked inside if the the solar panel is kept in a window that gets a decent amount of sunlight, or outside.  Not only is it solar powered but it only turns on when it's dark outside.  Well, technically it can be turned on while it's light inside or outside if the solar panel is covered so light isn't shining on it, but then you would have to make sure to uncover it so it can charge.  Just face the solar panel towards the sun or facing directly up and turn it on, it won't turn on or start blinking until the sun goes down and the solar panel ""sees"" that it's dark.  I just really like not having to hassle with timers to turn on outside lights on or using extension cords throughout the yard.____________________Made by: BESTECHNOMade in: ChinaColor: Cool WhiteASIN: B015FSYKZ2Item model number: 200LEDSample provided by: BESTECHNOShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWNNXZYGKBKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FSYKZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3VWNNXZYGKBKU","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very comfortable compression socks.  I'm 5'6'', 130 lbs and wear a size 8.5 shoe.  I ordered a size Medium and they fit well.  They provide the most compression in the ankle and above but do not provide much compression in the toes or the arch.  I am actually that these aren't very tight in the toes because I already have trouble keeping my toes warm in the winter and in general.  These are a very nice quality compression sock  - -- they are thick and soft.  The thickness is great in that it can be worn in different types of shoes - it's not too thick in the ankle region to where it will make everyday shoes feel too tight.The only thing I don't like about these are that it says do not machine wash.  I don't hand wash my socks, and so I'm hoping that my washer being a front-loading tumbling washer will be okay for washing these as I plan to put them in a delicate mesh garment washer bag.  I will update this review if washing them this way proves to be a mistake.  But overall I am very pleased with these socks._____________Made by: FyttoMade in: TaiwanSize: MediumColor: BlackASIN: B00NTTI9YSUPC: 819567010755Item model number: PTI1080Product provided for review by: ComfytopiaShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVX974FMMPRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTTI9YS#wasThisHelpful","R2BVX974FMMPRX","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice earring/jewelry holder it gets the job done but it doesn't look like it's high quality.  I'm not sure if I will keep this in a cupboard or out in the open because it does looks somewhat cheap -- I think mostly because the entire thing is acrylic - including the hinges.  If the hinges were a metal then I think this would look nicer.  I think this would be great for a little girl or teenager to display her jewelry.  Overall I think it's just a matter of preference, but for the price I think it's a good holder.I took a picture with a pen just to give a size reference.  For some reason I thought it was going to be taller than it was, which I'm glad it's the size that it is - it's only 11'' tall, so it's not huge._________________Made by:  BeautifyMade in: ChinaItem model number: 10/043ASIN: B014UU46M8Product provided for review by: Designer HabitatShipped by: Amazon LLC","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QA092PVKE3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UU46M8#wasThisHelpful","R19QA092PVKE3O","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was kindly supplied this item free of charge to test and evaluate.  In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts.  This is said review.Overall this is a nice tablet and it's a good price for what you get.  It works well and it's fast.  My only issue with it is that it wants to allow Google to track everything you do.  You have to have a Google account to download any apps or to even access the app/play store.  I had no problem connecting it to wireless internet or using the web browser.  I was surprised when it was charged and then I didn't use it for 4-5 days and when I picked it up the battery was dead.  Overall the graphics are nice, it's not a retina display but the graphics are good.  There are many options of images to use for the background image, some of which are moving background images you can choose.  The display flips from landscape to portrait and back very quickly and fluidly.  For the price this is a great little tablet.  I think it would be good for kids or maybe older individuals who may not use a tablet often or may not need a lot of memory.  This has 8GB of memory, whereas my phone has 16GB and I'm always running out of space so I'm sure this will quickly run out of space if I download apps or take a number of pictures.______________________Made by: Dragon TouchMade in: ChinaASIN: B015K35QBOSold by:  TabletExpressShipped by:  TabletExpress","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD4X4ZWV0PVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015K35QBO#wasThisHelpful","R3DD4X4ZWV0PVJ","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pick the size based on your WAIST measurement -- the hip and bust measurements given in the Product Description threw me off.  I have a 36'' Bust, 26'' Waist, 39'' Hips and I originally ordered a size M because of the bust and hip measurements threw me off since my bust and hip measurements hit in the listed range for a XXL.  And I'm not really sure why it says ""Corset Size are given in inches and measured from the NARROWEST point around the bust, waist and hips."" because I'm not sure what the narrowest point around your hips are because your hips are your hips you're supposed to measure your hips where your hips are and it's usually measured at the fullest/widest part of your hips. Anyway, my suggestion is to order JUST based on the waist measurement.  I returned the first one and ordered a small and it fits snug on the loosest fitting and so I have room to hook it tighter with time.Overall the material of this is very nice, and it is very well made.  Unfortunately there was one loop for one of the hooks missing on the one I was sent, but because there are so many hooks and loops I'm not really bothered by it.  Overall If you're looking for a waist trainer I would definitely recommend this brand - I'm very pleased._____________________Made by: Lover BeautyMade in: ChinaColor: AtrousSize: S/Waist 26'' (Fits Waist 26.4-28.3)ASIN: B014EX65JIProduct provided for review by: Lover BeautyShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J51YI7NAFLWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EX6FVG#wasThisHelpful","R3J51YI7NAFLWL","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cute and comfortable sweater.  I'm 5'6'', 130lbs, 36-26-39 and I ordered it in a size Large.  I could probably have ordered a Medium but because a lot of clothes that are Made in China and sold on Amazon tend to run small I ordered a size larger than I would normally wear and it is larger than I would normally wear. So I would say this top fits as expected, thus I would suggest ordering in the size you would usually order in most tops.  It shrank just a little in the washer & dryer, but not much.  I think the medium would have fit more like the model in the photos but because I wanted a more loose, casual fit I am happy with the large.  I like that this sweater is warm but it's not hot - and it's not itchy either.  It didn't have any loose strings or anything.

"I was kindly supplied this item free of charge to test and evaluate. In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts. This is said review.I LOVE this thing.  For the next two years I will be traveling for work and living out of a few suitcases and this saves me from having to bring 3 separate plug/chargers for 3 different devices of mine.  I have a rechargeable reading lamp that uses one of the adapter heads, my LED gel nail polish light uses another and my tablet uses another.  Although I was somewhat frustrated at first because this did not come with directions and I didn't want to fry any of my devices, I quickly realized that all my devices say the required voltage on the devices themselves or on the bases of the chargers themselves (or both).  My only complaint besides this not coming with directions is the adapter heads themselves are somewhat difficult to attach to the cord, but once they're on there they don't fall or slip off easily.  So overall I am VERY happy with this because it is saving me space is super convenient and easy to use, once you figure out the voltage requirements for your individual devices and just get used to changing the dial for individual devices.___________________________Made by: SoulBayMade in: ChinaASIN: B00ZTZQ5OQPurchased at a discount from: SoulBay DirectShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 6 days after order date","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKWOTO97BXXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTZQ5OQ#wasThisHelpful","RXKWOTO97BXXI","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little desk lamp!***PROS***- Small & light weight. It's easy to pick up and move closer or further from what your reading if you want more or less light.- Portable - it stays charged so you can unplug it and move it with you to another location easily for a short period because it's so lightweight and because it holds a charge without being plugged in. (obviously it needs to be plugged in to charge up but once it's charged it stays lit for a while)- I really like that it has 3 light/dim settings. The other LED desk lamp I had been using only had on/off and no other settings so this is nice to be able to change the brightness.- The little touch on/off switch is really nice because it's silent to turn it on and off. The lamp I had been using previously clicked even time you turn it on and off and it always would wake up my dogs, and they knew I was leaving my desk, but now with this light I can turn it on and off without waking them up, it's great.- I like the USB aspect of this because I can plug it into my computer to charge it if I want to take it with me.- I REALLY like that because it's LED it doesn't get hot like the halogen lamp I have.***CONS***- It's big enough to light up the task in front of you, the book your reading or the paper you're writing on, but it's not going to light up a big desk._______________________________Made by: PremerMade in: ChinaColor: WhiteASIN: B016AEDO5MProduct provided for review by: TRADEMAShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PWKEFQP84U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDO5M#wasThisHelpful","R19PWKEFQP84U","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very nice wireless headphones. The sound is good and they have a nice sleek design. On to the pros and cons...***PROS*** Good quality sound through the headphones themselves. My phone and laptop found the headphones very easily and paired with them in seconds -- It comes up in the bluetooth as ""QY8"". They charged in about 10-15 min. There is a red light that is on when they are charging and then it turns blue when they are done charging. Great for working out because you never have to worry about the cord and if you're using your phone you can have it across the room, you don't have to carry it or keep it on you the whole time. The volume buttons on these are conveniently on one of the ear pieces and the + is represented by two raised dots '..' and the minus volume button is one single raised dot. Unlike some of the other wireless headphones I've tried, the raised parts to quickly identify if you're pressing to increase or decrease the volume are prominent to the touch as to not mistake which part of the button you're pressing.***CONS*** There is a little plastic cap/plug that covers where you insert the micro USB to charge the headphones that is difficult to remove/open without a knife, small finger nails or pick of some sort -- it's just really small and there is no lip or area to grab or pull on to remove it to charge the headphones - (I may just end up cutting it off because it does not making charging these as easy as charging a phone). Unlike some of the other headphones I've tried, these started to hurt my ears after wearing them for a few hours. I kept taking one out and just rubbing the inside of my ear because it just felt sore, I'm not sure if this has to do with the fact that the hard plastic speaker part that is covered by the rubber ear plug is larger in diameter than some other of the other speakers themselves. Although I didn't have any issues with these falling out easily or becoming loose and having to push them back in compared to some other ear bud-style headphones.______________Made by: CakaMade in: ChinaColor: WhiteASIN: B00YPT5IA4Item model number: dgf34Product provided for review by: CakaShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 3 days after order date","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUUPJMY10722/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPT5IA4#wasThisHelpful","R2SUUPJMY10722","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tend to get oily in my T-zone more often than not and this lotion has definitely helped keep it looking more matte than shiny during the day.  It has a nice, mild, fresh scent - nothing very potent.  I prefer to use lotions like this under my makeup, but I have used this without makeup and I like it without also.  It's not super heavy and thick like some face lotions , but it's still very moisturizing.  It's not very greasy either.The only thing I don't like like is that it's in a tub and not a pump bottle.  Every time I put my finger in the tub (even if I've just washed my hands) I know it's getting bacteria in the jar.  And given that the ingredients of most cosmetics are quite nutritious for your average bacteria, if your beauty stash sits in a nice warm bathroom cabinet, you've suddenly got the perfect breeding ground for the bacteria that can cause you to break out.  So I may transfer this to a pump jar.__________________Made by: MediDermMade in: USAASIN: B00DO24D68UPC: 718122440818Item model number: 7637RPurchased at a discount from: Mediderm LaboratoriesShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 8 days after order date","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAB06SMSRLA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DO24D68#wasThisHelpful","RKAB06SMSRLA2","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little thermometer.  There are a fair amount of instructions to read to figure out all the different features this thing has.  I sort of wish the base/cradle for this device that the probe wire plugs into was able to be put into the oven with the probe rather than sit on the counter next to the oven but I guess that's what is necessary to have a wireless digital thermometer.  I really like this give you the ability to walk away from the kitchen with the digital temperature reader either in your hand or attached to your hip and still be able to glance at how your dinner is coming along without even being in the kitchen.  I also really liked that this came with all the batteries needed (4x AAA batteries) to get this working straight out of the box.The thing I don't like about this is that it doesn't tell me in the instructions how I can calibrate it.  It does not provide any instructions how to calibrate with boiling water or water filled with crushed ice to calibrate this baby from time to time.  So for that reason I can only give it 5 stars.

"This Gaffers Tape is nice and thick.  I feel like it's a combination between Scotch clear packaging tape and duct tape. It pulls up from the roll quickly and easily, where as duct tape seems to want to stick and roll back from the layer below it on the roll.  This tape is thick and strong.  It hasn't left any residue on any surfaces I've use it on.  I can only compare this gaffers tape to one other type of gaffer tape that I've tried and I definitely think this one is better than the XFasten gaffers tape - which is the only other type I've tried.  The XFasten was like a thin fabric tape whereas this Gaffers Tape Solutions tape is definitely more heavy duty and thick.  It's definitely not thin or flimsy.

"I was kindly supplied this item at a discounted price to test and evaluate. In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts. This is said review.As an anti-aging eye cream/gel this works great.  It definitely makes the skin around my eyes feel taught and look firmer.  But boy is this a small bottle. 0.5 oz, 15 mL.  Other eye gels I've tried are almost always in 1.7 oz, 50 mL jars and the only other one I've seen that was the same 0.5 oz size as this bottle was exactly 1/3 of the price.  Besides the size and price, the only other thing I don't like about this is when I put it on at night it leaves the skin around my eyes with a tacky/sticky sort of finish.  It doesn't dry to a smooth finish.  And when I rub my eyes after putting it on after it's ""dried"" it beads up, or balls up and rubs off easily.It definitely does what it's supposed to do in that it makes the area around my eyes look tighter and smoother but for the other reasons I listed above it's just not my favorite eye gel._______________Made by: LunoreMade in: U.S.A.ASIN: B016FLEZH6Item model number: LUNPRO100Sold by: LunoreShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 8 days after order date","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BU96J70KUZ60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016FLEZH6#wasThisHelpful","R1BU96J70KUZ60","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm 5'6.5'', weigh 130lbs, 36'' Bust, 26'' Waist, 39'' Hips, normally wear a size 6 and I ordered a XL.  I normally get a Medium in zip up tops like this but because nearly all clothes I've come across on Amazon that are Made in China and sold by Chinese sellers tend to run small, I ordered 2 sizes larger, though with this I probably should have gone with a Large IF I wanted it to fit like the model in the stock photos.  Right out of the box this is somewhat large in the mid section and when standing straight up the end of the sleeves falls right above the beginning of my thumb nail.  This cotton sweatshirt-material definitely appears like it is the type that will shrink in the wash, as most cotton sweatshirts do.  So I'm hoping after the first wash that this shrinks to the size that I would expect a large would be out of the box.Overall this sweatshirt/jack appears to be pretty well made, in that the zippers work well and the fabric is nice and super soft.

"Having tested other OZ Naturals products, I was curious to try this toner because my skin is increasingly sensitive has been reacting badly to any kind of astringent product.  So for the most part I quit using them.  And unfortunately this toner will not get me using them because it's just gross.  Maybe I got a bad bottle, but there are other reviews of bottles with similar problems - around the cap it's molding/mildewing and there are chunks of brown stuff floating in it, and it doesn't help that it has a bad odor.  If it had a bad oder and didn't have brown stuff floating in it and mildew at the top then I'd be more inclined to use it, but I question if it's just breeding bacteria and I definitely don't want to spray it any more on my skin.

"This is a quality, well made product.  I could tell simply from the packaging/box this product came in that it was high quality. But after opening it it is very obvious that this company not only cares about the quality of the item itself but of the quality of the presentation of the entire package. I like that it's skinny and only takes up one outlet. I like that it doesn't cover up more than one outlet on my wall or on a power strip - unlike some of the other wider, boxier plugs.

"This is a nice neck/face moisturizer, it smells wonderful and goes on smooth. It is definitely a moisturizing moisturizer - not a lightweight moisturizer.  I prefer to use this on just my face rather than my my face and neck When I have put it on my neck I find that because it is not a very thin/lightweight moisturizer I feel like I am tugging a fair amount on the skin on my neck as I rub it in in upward motions. I don't feel my skin being tugged on when I put it on my face because the skin on my face doesn't have as much room to move, so I don't feel like I'm stretching my face skin as much compared to when I use this on my neck.  I prefer lighter weight, thinner, silkier moisturizers for on my neck, around my eyes, etc.  but this works great as simply a face night cream for me.  I tend to use it more in the drier months during the winter and will likely use something lightweight during the summer.

"I was kindly supplied this item to test and evaluate.  In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts.  This is said review.This XFasten Gaffer Tape is the second type of gaffer tape I tried and I like it for some things but not for others.This tape is thin and very flexible.  It reminds me of the tape used to wrap the ankles of athletes and wrap the handles of hockey sticks.It hasn't left residue on any of the surfaces I've used it on.  It sticks better to completely flat, non-porous surfaces.  It doesn't stick as well to any porous cement or concrete.  It does not tear as easily as the other gaffer tape I tried, it does not tear easily by hand.  It also does not have nearly as much visible adhesive on the back when compared to the  Overall, I think it really depends on what you plan on using this tape for to determine if this gaffer tape is right for you.  If you're looking for thin, very flexible, fabric gaffer tape, that is not like any duct tape-type of tape then this is right for you.

"This is an awesome little salt/pepper grinder!!  Unfortunately this didn't come with any directions, but it wasn't too hard to figure out.It came in a white box and after opening, the top silver part pulls off to expose where you put the batteries.  It takes 6 AAA batteries around the top.  You then remove the black part the batteries are on to fill the bottom.  I actually used ~70% salt and 30% black pepper which I though was a great combo since I have simple salt shakers and pepper shakers, but rather than having two grinders when I usually add somewhere around that ratio while cooking I thought it was an easy way to kill two birds with one stone.Anyway, when putting it back together make sure the little metal prongs on the top black part meet the little metal plates on the bottom piece so the power from the batteries can power the grinder in the base.  After the black part is attached to the base, then you can slip the top silver part back on and lock it so it's secure.Now on to grinding!  There is a convenient little light on the bottom of the grinder to help better see the amount that is being ground onto your food.  Although it's not the brightest light, it is there to help.  The first time I used it I thought it was grinding somewhat slowly, but then I realized if I'm using this on a meal I don't want it to grind a lot of salt/pepper really fast.  I would rather put on less salt/pepper than have it grind fast and put too much on.  So when using this while cooking recipes, it's great because I'm not trying to add a tablespoon of salt or pepper and when I am cooking a recipe that calls for more thats when I get a measuring spoon and measure table salt.The grinder has two labels, twist one direction to get a more coarse grind and the other direction for a finer grind.  Personally I didn't see much of a difference between the fine and coarse grind (see last pic).  Either way this grinder grinds more finely than most restaurant black pepper grinders and I like that about it.Overall I really like this grinder, it's simple and easy to use.  I think it would be especially easy to use for anyone with pain or arthritis in their hands and wrists and would make it easier than twisting a traditional salt/pepper grinder.

"I was kindly supplied this item free of charge to test and evaluate. In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts.  This is said review.This camera is nice, but the app is not good, and the camera doesn't do much if the app is bad.  The app is not able to be downloaded on my iPad that is only 4 years old, and with Apple recently removing hundreds of apps from the app store that were made in China  because they had security problems with the apps taking your personal information on your phone or tablet, I am reluctant to download this app on my phone, but Id prefer to just download it on my iPad.  At the time I am posting this, the MIPC app that needs to be downloaded to use this camera has a measly 1.5 out of 5 stars.  The reviews speak for themselves, most people are pretty unhappy with it.  Im sort of surprised the only way to view your footage is by downloading an app, they dont have any sort of website you can log into to view your camera?  You cant view your camera if you don't always have the device the app is downloaded on with you.  My phone is not ALWAYS with me, and when I travel, particularly out of the country, I cant use the app from my computer, and I cant log into a website to view the feed either.  That being said, I would feel like my information is more secure if I didn't have to download a foreign app to view my feed, and I'd like this camera more if the app was even compatible with my iPad, unfortunately it is not.I have ordered other SkyGenius products and been very happy with them and the quality of their products.  I think the app needs improvement with this one as the app is a big part of using this product.  Definitely suggest taking a look at the MIPC app before deciding to buy this camera.__________________Made by: SkyGeniusMade in: ChinaASIN: B014FCAU2GProvided for review by: AUDOShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 7 days after order date","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOCAPWEISYEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FCAU2G#wasThisHelpful","R2XOCAPWEISYEJ","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great, convenient little travel bottles.***PROS*** TSA-approved 3.3oz size Caps and bottles are secure and don't appear that they would leak because the caps are thick plastic and lock shut very well. The little slit where you squirt out your lotion/shampoo etc. is a little cross like slit and when you're not applying pressure squeezing the bottle the little slit inverts back up and holds the product inside.  So even if the cap flipped open the product wouldn't just drip out unless there was pressure on the bottle forcing the contents out. Thick silicone makes these bottles easy to squeeze, and the caps being at the bottom makes it easy to get out nearly all the product when you're near the end. Labels around the base of the lids are adjustable so you can label any of the bottles with Shamp., Soap, Lotion, Cond., Sun, or a blank spot where you can write your own label if you want. Loops at the top make it easy to hook two or three of these to a carabiner and attach it to a swim/gym bag.***CONS***NoneOverall I would definitely recommend these bottles because they are easy to fill and refill and the suction cups make them easily stick to the wall.

"I was kindly supplied this item at a discounted price to test and evaluate. In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts. This is said review.PROS: Pretty well made/durable Nice size - not huge so it's easily portable The loop is convenient so you have the opportunity to hang it - or there are sticky pads on the back to stick it to a surface. Paired quickly and easily with my phone.CONS: Sound is mediocre at best. It sounds okay, but the white noise when it's not playing music is loud and pretty annoying if you're anywhere close to the speaker. If you were in another room I'm sure it wouldn't be as loud but sitting next to this speaker, anytime you're searching for a song or between songs, there is a static/white noise that is constant. The sticky pads on the back are a one time deal. Stick once and it's staying there. It would be nice if they were velcro pads or maybe a suction cup hook through the loop so it wasn't permanently stuck wherever you stick it. I fear it will pull the paint off my walls if I stick it to the wall. There is a voice that speaks after you turn it on and I'm going to guess the woman's voice is speaking in Mandarin (it's clearly not English), even though this device is being sold on Amazon.com (in the U.S.).That being said, the sound from a speaker is a HUGE selling point for any bluetooth speaker and this just isn't as good as I would expect for a speaker listed for $21.99. I think this speaker would be great for kids/teens or would be a better deal if it was maybe $9.99-11.99, but for $21.99 there are better sounding bluetooth speakers.________________Made by: VomachMade in: ChinaASIN: B016KHTCW8Sold by: VomachShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 11 days after order date","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXGZW94N2HA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016KHTCW8#wasThisHelpful","R3IXGZW94N2HA0","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These cable works - they charge my wireless headphone, wireless speaker and my external power bank with no problems.  These cables are slightly thicker than a lot of the OEM Micro USB cords I've gotten with the products I listed above.

"I've tried a few pairs of wireless headphones and I'd say these are definitely some of the better ones!***PROS***'  GREAT quality sound through the headphones themselves.'  My phone and laptop found the headphones very easily and paired with them in seconds.' They charged in about 10-15 min. There is a red light that is on when they are charging and then it turns blue when they are done charging.' Great for working out because you never have to worry about the cord and if you're using your phone you can have it across the room, you don't have to carry it or keep it on you the whole time.***CONS***' There is a little plastic cap/plug that covers where you insert the micro USB to charge the headphones that is difficult to remove/open without a knife, small finger nails or pick of some sort -- it's just really small and there is no lip or area to grab or pull on to remove it to charge the headphones - (I may just end up cutting it off because it does not making charging these as easy as charging a phone). It also doesn't want to stay back on/in when trying to plug the outlet, it just keep s falling open.' Volume buttons are conveniently on one of the ear pieces but the +/- of the volume buttons aren't very prominent to the touch.

I've let my hair air dry a few times after using this when I haven't been going out and each time I don't even have to comb my hair after using this because it air dries completely tangle free, and silky.

"I LOVE this little speaker!  It is TINY.  It's about the size of a small shot glass.PROS:-  It has super crisp clear sound.  It doesn't have heavy base but the audio is very clear.- No white-noise when audio is not playing.  I have a larger bluetooth speaker that was more expensive and whenever music is not playing it has an annoying white noise sound coming from the speaker, and another bluetooth speaker I had also had the same problem.  But this one does not give off any sound of white noise or static when music is not playing, which is really nice.- It gets surprisingly loud for a little speaker.  It's not enough to play music in a whole house but you can definitely hear it a few rooms away if it's on the loudest volume.- Very easy to use - one button on the bottom to power it on and off.- Very sleek/simple design.- Very easy to take with you or bring around the house since it's so small.CONS:- Bluetooth range starts to get choppy if you take your phone (or whatever is the audio/music source) more than 15-20 feet from the speaker or in another room.- You can't turn the volume up/down on the speaker itself, only from the volume button on what it's connected to.- The power button is not a simple 1-click ON/OFF, you have to hold it for 3-4 seconds to turn it on and to turn it off.- Rather than a simple tone/beep when the device is turned on and when it is connected.  When you turn it on there is some brief music and then there is a ladies voice that says that the device is turned on and ready to be paired and then she speaks again to say that the bluetooth device is connected.  I'd rather not have to listen to music and a persons voice every time I turn it on and pair it.Overall, for the price, this is an AWESOME little speaker.  It's definitely a better quality than I expected for the price.

It's thick, durable and I'm very pleased with it!______________Made by: collenColor: 2 White(TPU)ASIN: B015IJK06QSample provided by: collen caseShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBPCIY3DZN2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IJK06Q#wasThisHelpful","R3GBPCIY3DZN2V","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice resistance band and it's definitely long enough to do a whole slew of workouts.  The bands are listed as lbs. of tension per band, which can be a little confusing. Basically, the bigger bands will pull you up to the bar more easily, or with less effort -- so if you weigh a lot and need just a little help, or if you don't weigh much and need a lot of help, you'd use the same band.If you're looking for something just to help with pull ups then generally the bigger bands are where you might want to start out and work your way down to the smaller ones. If you mainly want these for other resistance training, then you'll probably want to start with the smaller ones because they provide less resistance -- but you can always double it back on itself because they are so long, to get more resistance with the same band.  This is definitely a high quality band and it's been helping me out, working great._____________________Made by: KYLIN SPORTColor: Purple - 35 to 85 Pounds (1.25"" x 41"")ASIN: B00VFVIW08Provided for review by: KYLIN SPORTShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCU2LI0SPTFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMVUI9A#wasThisHelpful","RLCU2LI0SPTFM","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lights are so easy to use. I love that they don't have to be plugged in to an outlet so I can put nearly anywhere in my yard or near any window in my house and not need an extension cord to plug them into an outlet. They work well and charge quickly. They actually were able to blink right out of the box, although I turned them off and let them charge before testing all the blinking settings. These work inside if you can keep the solar panel in a window that gets a decent amount of sunlight, or even easier outside.  The solar panel can twist to almost any angle, so you can either keep it facing the sun where the sun rises or just keep it facing straight up so it gets sun throughout the day.  I took off a star because the first set I ordered were really inconsistent.  I let them charge in a window with a lot of sun for more than a day and they blinked but the wires connecting into the solar panel had to be positioned ever so slightly to get them to stay on or keep blinking in the other mode as they were designed to do.  I determined that must have been a faulty string, so I shipped them back and got a replacement and that replacement works great, lights up as it should and blinks as it should in each of the modes.  So although I love these lights now I did have to send one set back, but my second set works great._______________Made by: GoodiaMade in: ChinaColor: Mixed ColorASIN: B00YE378GIProduct provided for review by:GoodiaShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 7 days after order date","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8D7X1GKL0JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE378GI#wasThisHelpful","R3V8D7X1GKL0JB","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm 5'6.5'', weigh 130lbs, 36'' Bust, 26'' Waist, 39'' Hips, normally wear a size 6 and I ordered a XL.  I normally get a Medium in zip up tops like this but because nearly all clothes I've come across on Amazon that are Made in China and sold by Chinese sellers tend to run small, I ordered 2 sizes larger, though with this I probably should have gone with a Large IF I wanted it to fit like the model in the stock photos.  Right out of the box this is somewhat large in the mid section and when standing straight up the end of the sleeves falls right above the beginning of my thumb nail.  There is no tag/label that says that this is a ""wool-blend"" it truly feels like 100% cotton, which I like, but the description says that it's a ""wool-blend"" but based on all cotton clothes and sweatshirts and all wool and cashmere sweaters I have had over the years, this really feels like cotton to me.  That being said, this cotton sweatshirt-material definitely appears like it is the type to shrink in the wash, as most cotton sweatshirts do.  So I'm hoping after the first wash that this shrinks to the size that I would expect a large would be out of the box.Overall this sweatshirt/jack appears to be pretty well made, in that the zippers work well and the fabric is nice and super soft.  My only complaint is that the zipper pockets are too small for me to put my whole hand inside.  Maybe I just have larger hands for a female, but I can't fit my right hand in the right side, and I can JUST BARELY fit my left hand in the left pocket, but pulling it out the zipper scratches my hand because it's such a tight fit through the zipper opening.  So that may just be a problem with me.  The pockets are big enough to hold my cell phone fully inside and the zipper hole is large enough to get it in and out.  I just don't use the pockets for smaller things often because I end up having to push them up towards the opening to get them out.  But overall I like this sweatshirt because it's simple, and super comfortable._________________Made by: ACEVOGMade in: ChinaASIN: B016EO6UVSProvided for review by: ACEVOGShipped by: ACEVOGDelivered: Delivered 8 days after order date.

"These are very beautiful earrings.  They are very shiny and they definitely catch your eye.  They are a great size, not too big in diameter but they do stick out a little bit from the lobe of your ear.  I really love the color and the simplicity of these earrings.These came in a box suitable for giving to someone as a gift, but I would not suggest delivering them directly from Amazon as  gift because the nice box they come in is taped into a white cardboard sleeve that isn't as nice as the actual box that holds the earrings.  So if I were to send these as a gift I would want to receive them first to remove the outside cardboard sleeve because it makes the earrings and the outer box appear cheap.  But the box that holds the earrings is very nice.The earrings themselves and the backs are well made.  The backs fit on securely and I don't worry about them falling out.

"These pens write well, and the stylus part works on my phone and iPad.  The pens write, they don't skip sections, I don't have to tap them on the paper to get the ink to the bottom to write.  All the ink is black.  My only criticism is the ink is OCCASIONALLY thicker at some parts... Not just when starting to write, but sometimes it gives just a little bit more ink out when writing something so it isn't as thin of a coat of ink and so it takes just slightly longer to dry and can smudge in those particular spots.  This doesn't happen often and it happens with nearly all ball point pens I've used (unless they are stupid expensive), but these are great pens and they work great and the stylus' do too._______________Made by: Magic-TMade in: ChinaColor: 10pcs ColorfulASIN: B00PLMN77KItem model number: 3319760Provided for review by: Magic-TShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UI0MAHSTY7XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLMN77K#wasThisHelpful","R1UI0MAHSTY7XR","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pick the size based on your WAIST measurement -- the hip measurements given threw me off.  I have a 36'' Bust, 26'' Waist, 39'' Hips and I originally ordered a size L because of the bust and hip measurements threw me off since my bust and hip measurements hit in the listed range for a 4XL.  And I'm not really sure why it says ""Corset Size are given in inches and measured from the NARROWEST point around the bust,waist and hips."" because I'm not sure what the narrowest point around your hips are because your hips are your hips and there isn't many places to measure hips.  Anyway, my suggestion is to order JUST based on the waist measurement.  I returned the first one and ordered a small and it fits snug on the loosest fitting and so I have room to hook it tighter with time.Overall the material of this is very nice, it is very well made which I was very happy about.

"This LAVO face cleansing brush makes my skin feel AMAZING.  The way it buffs my face feels amazing it feels like Im getting a facial when I use it  its THAT wonderful.  It makes me skin feel so clean, so new, so refreshed, I absolutely love it, I dont know how I went so long without getting any sort of cleansing brush.  It takes two AA batteries and has two speeds  press once for slow, once more for high.  I love that it is water resistant, so its easy to use in the shower.

I sort of wish one of them was slightly more abrasive but I just love this machine, I truly dont know how I went so long without any sort of cleansing brush like this one.  It has made my skin look and feel wonderful and would DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone, any age who really just wants to take care of their skin.  I wish I had this when I was a teen when I relied on Proactiv and a lot of acne medications and washes to try to keep my skin clear, I feel like this really would have helped my skin back then.

"BINGO!! This thing is awesome!  The overwhelming majority of cell phones these days use a cord that is a USB on one end to charge and so this is perfect.  It makes it super easy to charge your phone because youre not always looking for two pieces (cord and USB plug adapter), but just grab your cord and you can charge.  Besides the two wall outlets, I used to have to use two different chargers to charge two different things, taking up two different wall sockets in the kitchen  at least in my bedroom I have a 2-port USB wall charger/plug adapter thing.  Although Ive seen wall outlets that are just two USB outlets or just 4 USB outlets, I have not previously seen ones that keep the two wall plugs and just add two USB outlets to the same thing.

"This is a great konjac sponge.  I love how soft this sponge is.  It is a lot softer than certain, similarly shaped, charcoal sponges Ive used. It definitely lathers up my facewash and soap and really makes my skin feel clean after using it with my cleanser.  I prefer to use it in the shower were I can easily rinse off all my face wash after using the sponge.  The sponge is a lot different than a wash cloth in that it's hard to really feel like youve wiped off all your cleanser or face wash when using the sponge.  I find myself rinsing the sponge so much and wiping so much with the sponge if Im using it at the sink to wash my face  so I just prefer to use it in the shower.  My only criticism is the hook doesn't stick very well to my shower wall.  It doesn't ever get a great suction because where the hook attaches to the suction cup it allows air to get behind, so it doesn't suction very well.  I have other suction cups in my shower so I know it's not that I'm trying to suction it on a surface that is not smooth, it just doesn't suction very well.

"I always feel like you can really tell the quality of a product based on the quality of the packaging, and this is definitely an example of that.  It is obvious that lot of thought when into the packaging of this double walled stainless steel thermos/water bottle.  And upon opening it I realized how well made the thermos itself was.  It is very well made and very durable.  It definitely would make for an impressive gift, because the packaging and the bottle itself look very well made and expensive.  I LOVE that this is made of stainless steel and not aluminum.  It is easy to wash and definitely has no problem keeping things hot.  I dont think Ive ever seen a thermos that has its own strainer in the top that fits perfectly in it; it works very well.  Although Im not a huge fan of the quote on the bottle, I just love how well its made, even if it said the brand name across the top I would still like it because of how nice it is overall.  The only thing I would change about it is the holes in the strainer are a little big for things like ground coffee or some finer teas  Im not sure if its just supposed to hold a tea bag or if its supposed to allow you to put fresh or dried herbs or tea in the strainer itself.  But so far Ive just used it to hold my tea bag or just left it out when Ive poured coffee in it.

"These hot/cold water bottle therapy bags work great and are well made.  These are definitely durable water bags.  I have not had any issues with either of them leaking.  The plastic is pretty flexible, but it's thick, so it keeps its shape well. And because they keep their shape well, they stand up easily against a wall or backsplash with the top end down so they can dry out.The following instructions are printed on one or both of the bottles:- When filling this hot water bottle, do not use boiling water and fill to a maximum of 2/3 capacity.- Expel air from the bottle, screw the stopper sufficiently tight.- Prevent contact with hot surfaces.- Check the bottle and stopper for wear and damage at regular intervals.- Store empty and with stopper removed.When I'm having muscle cramps or stomach cramps I like being able to put heat on my stomach, but I don't like that most heating pads have to be plugged in the whole time.  So I really like how portable these bags are.__________________Made by: HomeIdeasMade in: ChinaColor: BlueASIN: B013AQSC82Product provided for review by: HomeIdeasShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRLY5MVGPMEN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013AQSC82#wasThisHelpful","RRLY5MVGPMEN3","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel like you can tell a product is a good quality if the packaging it comes in is a good quality.  The box this comes in is almost like a gift box with how well it's made.  So just to start with, the presentation of this charger is very nice.  This charger charges my phone as expected and did not have any sort of compatibility issues with any USB cords or any of the devices I've used with it.  I have not had any issues with this charging slowly with more things plugged into it.  Although it does get a little warm when charging multiple devices, I feel that is somewhat expected, but it doesn't get hot or anything. I will update this review at a later date if this wears out or quits working. This is the second BlitzWolf product I've tried and I'm definitely impressed with the quality of their products and they work well.  Very pleased._________________Made by: BlitzWolfColor: BlackASIN: B013WEI99OItem model number: BW-C1-KProduct provided for review by: BlitzWolfShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 4 days after order date","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ADHWB5WGGBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WEI99O#wasThisHelpful","R30ADHWB5WGGBY","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are BEAUTIFUL pearl earrings!! I have had a number of pearl earrings over the years and these are BY FAR my new favorite because they are UNIQUE.  They aren't perfect circles, so they aren't just like everyone elses.  These are round and then the back is a little bit flatter.  But these look great, they aren't too big but they are noticeable, but pretty and professional.  Mine did not come with a velvet drawstring bag like other reviews but that doesn't bother me because I have other drawstring bags.  Overall Although I received these for the purposes of reviewing them, I would definitely recommend these to friends and family and anyone wanting unique, pretty pearl earrings, and I will definitely purchase a new set if I lose one or both of them!  Love these!!  :)_______________Made by: GemofMade in: ChinaStyle: Simple PearASIN: B00Z9V81O2Item model number: JE0007Product provided for review by: GemofShipped by: GemofDelivered: 10 days after order date","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WT2V91YY7SI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9V81O2#wasThisHelpful","R2WT2V91YY7SI7","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice smooth serum that has a light pleasant scent.  The packaging is very nice and the bottle looks very luxurious.The serum is lightweight and has a medium consistency, not super runny but not as thick as a gel. There is definitely a tightening feeling after this serum dries.  Although that feeling doesn't exactly last after I put my moisturizer on after, but if you don't have dry skin I'm sure you could just use the serum and enjoy that tight feeling longer.  Since I started using this my skin has gotten clearer and stayed clear, so for that reason alone, I am very pleased with this product.  Although I received this product for the purposes of reviewing it, I told the company that I would not promise or guarantee an positive review and that if I felt the product was not good that I would write a negative review.  But after trying this serum I definitely like it and like how it makes my skin feel.  Overall I'm pleased with this product.__________________Made by:  MediDermASIN: B00DMK9EOSUPC: 689076429641Item model number: 9595RSold by: Mediderm LaboratoriesShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 5 days after order date","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUXF2NSVMDA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMK9EOS#wasThisHelpful","R2GUXF2NSVMDA2","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually tend to shy away from things that have hair + oil in the title that I'm not supposed to wash out because they tend to make my hair look oily/greasy rather than just shiny smooth.  But I decided to give this a shot and I am very happy with how it did NOT make my hair oily or greasy looking.  I have shorter hair and I used about a drop and a half and it made my hair look shiny, silky and healthy, not shiny and greasy.  I sort of think this is more of a hair serum rather than a straight oil because the consistency is not as thin as straight oil.  So although I received this macadamia hair oil for the purposes of review, I would definitely recommend it to friends and family and will definitely be purchasing more when it runs out -- although that may be a long time.______________Made by: LusetaMade in: U.S.A.Not tested on animalsASIN: B00VIOM18GUPC: 857396004484Provided for review by: Komar BeautyShipped by: Komar BeautyDelivered: 8 days after order date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38SXI4TGAPL1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIOM18G#wasThisHelpful","R38SXI4TGAPL1S","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not nearly as bulky and takes up one less outlet where previously I had to use two.This is a quality, well made product. I could tell simply from the packaging/box this product came in that it was high quality. But after opening it it is very obvious that this company not only cares about the quality of the item itself but of the quality of the presentation of the entire package.It works, it's skinny, only takes up one outlet. I like that it doesn't cover up more than one outlet unlike some of the other wider - more boxy plugs.Overall I really like the BlitzWolf brand. I would definitely recommend this brand and this product as I am very impressed with the quality and presentation of their products as a whole.________________Made by: BlitzWolfMade in: ChinaColor: WhiteASIN: B015OGHDLSItem model number: BW-S3-WProduct provided for review by: BlitzWolfShipped by: BlitzWolfDelivered: 4 days after order date","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJIDR6DWVEVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OGHDLS#wasThisHelpful","R1LJIDR6DWVEVY","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lights are so easy and convenient to use!  I love that they don't have to be plugged in to an outlet so I can put them far out in my front yard or even around my mailbox and not need an extension cord to power them.  They work well and charge quickly.  They actually were able to blink right out of the box, although I turned them off and let them charge before testing all the blinking settings.  These work inside if you can keep the solar panel in a window that gets a decent amount of sunlight, or even easier outside.  The solar panel can twist to almost any angle, so you can either keep it facing the sun where the sun rises or just keep it facing straight up so it gets sun throughout the day.  The only downside to these is they wouldn't be great to use outdoors in a place that snows a lot, [obviously] because if the solar panel can't get enough sun then these won't stay on.  But also because these are LED lights and like regular outdoor holiday lights, these don't get nearly as warm/hot as regular bulbs.  So where regular holiday light strings may be able to melt a little of the snow so they can show through, these will likely not melt the snow as easily or show through as much.  But we don't live in a very snowy area so I'm excited to take these from our back porch out to the front yard this winter.  Very pleased._________________Made by: ADDLONMade in: ChinaColor: Cool WhiteASIN: B011WNL7K0Product provided for review by: ADDLONShipped by: Amazon LLCDelivered: 4 days after order date","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH5CLABNN7XQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011WNL7K0#wasThisHelpful","RH5CLABNN7XQ7","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was kindly supplied this item free of charge to test and evaluate. In exchange, I agreed to provide an honest review detailing my thoughts. This is my review.This blood pressure (BP) monitor was east to open, set up and use.  It is compact and works well.  To explain what I mean by ""well"" I took my mothers BP monitor that is a larger and more expensive machine and took my blood pressure and her blood pressure 4 times with her machine and 4 times with this Forestfish monitor.  Our blood pressures were taken while sitting in the upright position, feet flat on the floor, and taken on the same arm for each of the two devices (not one cuff on both arms at once). Results were as follows : (Monitor 1 = my mothers BP monitor,  Patient 1 = Me,  Patient 2 = My mother)PATIENT 1: BP (systolic/diastolic) & PulseMonitor 1:128/84  79134/90  80122/85  79129/89  72Average: 128.25/87  77.5Forestfish Monitor:128/87  79128/88  74126/86  78124/79  76Average: 126.5/85  76.75____________________PATIENT 2:  BP & PulseMonitor 1:106/72  65106/72  62102/73  63 97/76  68Average: 102.75/73.25  64.5Forestfish Monitor:112/66  6691/54  6793/65  6994/61  67Average: 97.5/61.5  67.25So my values only differed by 2 mmHg or less in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and my average pulses differed by not even one heart beat.  My mothers systolic (top/first number in the fraction) differed by ~5 mmHg, but her diastolic (bottom/second number) differed by 11.75 mmHg, which is a lot, but when measuring blood pressure systolic blood pressure being high tends to be the more worrisome one in most people.  Also without using a sphygmomanometer (non-electronic BP cuff & dial) and a stethoscope to take our blood pressure, there is no way to tell which of the two monitors may be off.  But seeing how the averages were so close among my (Patient 1) values, I trust that this monitor is as good as the next monitor.  I will update this review and compare the Forestfish monitor to a sphygmomanometer when I am able to get my hands on one.  But until then I think this is a pretty good BP monitor, just make sure if you're not in the medical field to read the directions on when and how to take your BP -- rest for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure is taken, sit upright, feet flat on the floor, legs uncrossed, arm supported and cuff mid-arm at heart level, 3cm from the fold of elbow, back supported, tube coming out towards your hand, in line with your artery etc.  All of this will help get a more accurate reading no matter what person or machine is taking your BP :)___________________Made by: ForestfishMade in: ChinaColor: Type2ASIN: B014T1B59AUPC: 710373501799Product provided for review by: ForestfishShipped by: Forestfish","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4T1BR3DMY0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014T1B59A#wasThisHelpful","R1J4T1BR3DMY0G","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VERY pleased with this case.  When I originally purchased my Macbook Pro (in December 2012) I purchased this Skque hard plastic case and it lasted 1 month.  Then I purchased an Incase Hammered Hardshell Case from the Apple Store, and it lasted 6 months.  So my fingers are crossed that this one will last longer than those did.  This one feels thicker and sturdier than the previous two I had and if I'm not mistaken this one appears to have more clips that hang over the edges that hold the case on -- which are the pieces that broke off one by one on the previous two cases, so hopefully the more there are the better it will stay on.  I will update this review at a later date if this one doesn't last long but so far I'm very pleased with the cover, the keyboard cover AND the screen protector.

"This workout band makes for an easy at-home work out.  I use it mostly for resistance training of the larger muscle groups in the arms and legs. These might not be great for body builders or anyone trying to really bulk up their muscle, but so far, I think it works best for toning arms and calves. I am a big fan of warranties because it shows that a brand is willing to stand behind their product, and so I like that this comes with a 12-month warranty.I like that it easily compacts and folds up, the handles aren't ridged so it can fold up pretty small -- so it's easy to keep next to the couch or between the couch cushions and just pull it out and do some stretches and resistance training while watching TV!  It's super convenient to have for an easy workout and it's well made._______________Made by: AegendASIN: B0151GOBH0Product provided for review by: Team AegendShipped by: Amazon LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVE3R5EAI9CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151GOBH0#wasThisHelpful","R3PVE3R5EAI9CH","AI8DDPX23JCV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI8DDPX23JCV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
