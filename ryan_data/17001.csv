"AMAZING! I have bought labels from probably a dozen retailers on amazon. These are by far the highest quality I've received. They have printing on the back of the label paper so you can tell you're putting it into the printer the right way. They do not curl as you peel them off and they stick well to the packages (polymailers and cardboard). I highly recommend these and I hope that next time I come to purchase it will be the same label, from the same retailer (amazon is bad about switching up on you!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIWQ53WBVNN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPJOT64#wasThisHelpful","R1WIWQ53WBVNN0","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are perfect for some of the larger items that I embroider and sell in my boutique. They seem a BIT thin to me, but I have never had a problem with them breaking or busting.

"I have been making wreaths and selling them to friends and family, so I went on the hunt for boxes to be able to mail my creations.

"My toddler is obsessed with trucks and putting things inside containers, so I knew this would be a hit! The toy is sturdy and colorful. It throws in numbers and colors matching too, which is nice. One great thing about this truck is that the cab and trailer have a sturdy connector. My toddler can be rough on his toys and the cheaper small trucks break apart where the cab and trailer connect, but this toy has held up. It's also easy for him to connect the two parts together so if it comes apart, he doesn't have to bring it to me to get me to put it back together every time. All in all, a good purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMTVNANPQPEKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0ML91Y#wasThisHelpful","RMTVNANPQPEKQ","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmmm.. This came in the mail quickly and is decent quality, but I don't think it is 18"" by 18"".. I have a pillow sham that I embroider for my business and I needed a cheap pillow form to be able to display it at a craft sale. I purchased this one, but the sham is baggy on the form. And I have used several 18"" by 18"" pillows from JoAnn craft store and they fit fine. This one is smaller by maybe an inch. I wouldn't buy again for something that I need to send to a customer, for example, but for a quick, cheap display purpose it is fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38J9AMJ64XB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8NA32O#wasThisHelpful","R38J9AMJ64XB4","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really hate this stabilizer. I have had great experiences with World Weidner's products on amazon, but this stuff is horrible for the purpose I bought it. It is SO THICK and STICKY, like 10 times stickier than it needs to be. Another reviewer said taking this stuff off your project is like peeling a sticker off a glass vase. Bingo! I made two hand towels with a basic design on them using this, and when I tried to peel this stabilizer off the back, it was IMPOSSIBLE. I now use them strictly as samples because I can't send these to a customer with this stuff on the back that will NEVER come off. I will probably try to use this on something like tote bags or slick microfiber polyester cosmetic bags, but I would never use on a knit/cotton item ever again. When I run out I would never buy more of this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDSYMYY3K3ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042PQVE8#wasThisHelpful","R1JDSYMYY3K3ZY","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third ""Green Toy"" we've purchased for our toddler after the airplane and school bus. I love the minimal packaging and quality feel and my toddler loves the sturdy truck and bright colors. This will be passed down to his brother and probably other relatives or friends after that.

"I can't believe what authors can get by with ""writing"" these days. This book has maybe 30 words in it. The illustrations are cute and my regular babysitter and I love acting out the different pages (""Where does the cat go to potty?"" ""I did it! Potty!"" etc) because we're zany like that.

"I didn't care for the texture of these shells. Maybe I'm not used to ""organic pasta"" (wouldn't that be sad?) but the pasta was a little ""thick"" or dense in consistency.

"This is a neat light. It is kindof cheaply made - light and seems like it might break with too much roughness from a toddler, so we keep it up on a shelf where he can just enjoy the light patterns without being tempted to mess with it. I do wish the buttons that changed modes allowed for ""going back"" so that you could just go back one step instead of going through all the patterns to get to the one you missed.

"My toddler LOVES school buses, so this was a no-brainer amazon purchase. I love that Green Toys uses recycled materials and minimal packaging. My son now has several Green Toys - the bus, plane, and I think a dump truck. He loves them all! They are sturdy and able to withstand lots of bangs and crashes that are typical of toddler play time.

"This kit came with easy-to-understand instructions and, if one prefers visual learning, a DVD with the instructions acted out.My very first batch of baby onesies came out just beautiful; I even looked on youtube for instructions on making different shapes within the tie dye, and I made a really cute heart shirt!

"I do embroidery at home, and to bond heat-n-bond lite, I have been taking my projects off my embroidery machine and moving them to the ironing board. Not only is that inconvenient, but it gives the project a wonderful chance to shift while in transit and stitch poorly when I put it back on my machine. Enter this mini-iron! I can iron my project right on the frame/hoop and not have to worry about shifting or moving. I purchased the larger tip right away, and I have been loving it. It has 3 heat settings; I usually use medium. My only complaint is that it takes 10+ minutes to heat up fully, but it's worth it once it gets going. I just have to remember to turn it on before I start my project.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IPNACSLK9G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CEAMH4#wasThisHelpful","R2IPNACSLK9G6","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can't beat World Weidner when it comes to embroidery products at a great price. I do, however, continually deduct a star from their products for including ZERO instructions with their materials.

"If you're expecting a garment rack that will hold 10 heavy coats, a $19 rack is probably not the one for you. Additionally, you must follow the instructions for assembly and make sure you get all the poles and plastic pieces together SNUGLY so they don't have room to wobble. I have purchased two of these and I am impressed with the quality for just $19.

"I know what you're thinking. I know EXACTLY what you're thinking. I thought the same thing when my husband told me about this ""awesome thing he saw somewhere"" that allows you to suck the snot out of your baby's nose with your mouth. Ummm, excuse me? No. Well, it finally happened: my husband was right, and I was wrong.1 or 2 little ""baby colds"" later, half a dozen restless if not completely sleepless nights later, I sent him out to purchase this miracle tube. And miracle it is, my friends.First of all, it's not as disgusting as I first thought. It's not like siphoning gas - the snot isn't going to fly up into your mouth. Check out the picture. The snot is collected into a tube at the baby's nose, and then you blow it back out into a nearby tissue or wipe. And unlike the infamous ""bulb syringe"", this works.Picture this: You're up in the middle of the night because baby is snoring and grunting. He can't breathe. Again. You lay him down on the changing table and grab the bulb syringe and depress it, and stick it into his nose. It slooooowly regains its shape and sucks out a bit of snot. You depress it again. By this time your baby is screaming like he's being squashed by an elephant. The problem with the bulb thingy is that it doesn't always ""suck"" fast enough, leaving you with a screaming baby. Enter nosefrida: You grab it and place the end of the tube into the baby's nose. You suck quickly. BAM! You can see what's coming out. You see your progress. Within 5 seconds, your baby's airway is clear and you pick him up to comfort him.It's easy to clean. It's transportable. It's ready whenever you need it. It's fast-acting. This thing ROCKS.Oh, and don't act like you're grossed out by this review.. If you already have a baby, no doubt you have seen and read things much, much grosser. And if you don't have one yet, well, let's just say that your conversation topics and amazon searches will become totally shameless, and snot is the least disgusting thing you will experience and talk about.To address other reviewers' germ concerns: I'm just cracking up at the number of 1-star reviews saying, ""I GOT THE EXACT SAME COLD AS MY BABY OMG!!"" Don't let being afraid of breathing your baby's exhalations that you don't order this. You're going to be all around his sicky germs regardless of what aspirator you use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19I80SMENX9O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00171WXII#wasThisHelpful","R19I80SMENX9O7","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"‘Rogue Lawyer’… well, they certainly nailed this title. I’ll not torture you with the usual jokes about lawyers that we love to hate, rather I’ll torture you with having you read this review instead of reading this wonderful book. John Grisham is a talent, but even I thought he was hard pressed to try and get me to like Sebastian.A lawyer who doesn't play by the rules and who defends the scum of society… yeah, I need his address so I can send a Christmas card. And that is just the surface stuff. As you read this book you’ll find out more about this guy that would make a cat hanging out at a San Francisco wharf refuse spill turn up his nose.But as I read more and more of this story, I found myself (kind of) liking this guy. But that may have something to do with his supporting cast: Judith… it’s been a long time since I’ve read a book where I wished for the death of a character as much as I did this (removed bad word because of Amazon’s rules) woman. I set aside a special type of hate for her. Then there’s Tadeo… this guy has the brain of Kendra Wilkinson and the arrogance of Trump. Had this book been longer I would have sued the Grisham estate for neck injury due to my head shaking.Rounding out this cess pool circle of friends is Arch. If Dr. Frankenstein were to ever to experiment with sleezy ooze, Arch would be it’s ordure. That’s all I’m going to say because I feel the need to shower just typing his name. Now keep in mind, those are the headliners. There are a ton of extras who colorfully add their own crime spice to this broth of filth. Grisham truly shows us the bottom of the barrel with the clients AND the lawyer.Now this book did have a different feel to it. To me, ‘Rogue Lawyer’ was a story of snippets of Sebastian’s life, and not one complete story. And even though it was told like that, it didn’t feel choppy. There were a couple times where it got a little preachy though. John tackles two hot button social topics, and in the narration of it, gets a bit Joel Osteen-ish. Nothing big, just… obvious.I think is a solid piece of work by Grisham that falls somewhere between ‘The Confession’ and the ‘The Litigators.’ Not all drama and not all fun. While reading this story there’s really no good place to pause and take a break. So unless you are one of those readers who can go through a book in one sitting (I’m not by a long shot) then prepare to do a lot of sneak-reading. I enjoyed reading this book and I’m comfortable in saying you will as well. Good reading, fun reading, quick reading, thoughtful reading. It’s what we expect and what Grisham delivers. Once again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXV0OXRE5ODV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539436#wasThisHelpful","RXV0OXRE5ODV4","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a year ago when I first heard about ‘One Night’, the recurring theme coming from everyone was “this is a different type of Eric Jerome Dickey book.” I had no idea what that meant or if that was a good or bad thing. So let me put your mind at ease by saying, “this is a different type of Eric Jerome Dickey book.” There. Feel better?If you follow Eric on FaceBook, Twitter, or Instagram you know he’s a man who thirsts for knowledge. It shows in his pictures, his posts, his humor, his rants, and his writing. Just when you think he can’t surpass his previous works, he hits you with a book like this. There were one thousand and one things going through my head while reading ‘One Night’, but the one thought, the ONE thought I had when I closed this book was, “this is fictional poetry.”You read his books for the pleasure but you take away much more. He’s the best type of writer (literary entertainer) because he makes you experience the moment without you even knowing you’re in the moment. Until after. It’s like a cherry-vanilla aftertaste. Now… about ‘One Night’…This story is a twelve hour adrenaline rush of drama and passion set in a theater of eroticism and violence. Eric could teach a class in misdirection. And pain.The man writes pain in ‘One Night’ like Joshua Bell plays his violin. An elegantly complicated erotic tango of “I don’t know” between Jackie and the man from Orange County . And I think that might be the “different” people were talking about. Other EJD books have a cast of characters whom play off each other like the London Symphony. This go ‘round there were really only two. But two in Eric’s hands are like one-hundred on someone else’s.Pay close attention to the beginning of this story, if not you’ll miss something. Once it finally clicked with me it was like someone opened the Autobahn. This was also the first time in a LONG time where I felt that the story wasn’t really the focal point of the story. I know that doesn’t make complete sense, but this was a very character driven book and the circumstances happened because of the people. Not the other way around.Like Eric’s other leading ladies, Jackie is a tsunami of power, chaos, sexuality, and uncertainty. Her internal AND external battles is the yin that carries this book and it drags you salivating through each page. The mysticism and violence from the man from Orange County is the yang.The sex in this book is the bang to the yin and yang.It is impossible to read an Eric Jerome Dickey book and not talk about how seductively humid they are. And in a character driven story like ‘One Night’, you don’t walk away from the scenes… you crawl. Why? Because that’s all you can do. I’ve been sitting her trying to figure out the best way to describe the eroticism in this book.(One day later...) OK, I've decided to stop trying. Anything I say won't do it justice, and an EJD story needs to be experienced. Just prepare yourself. The intellect written in this story is as sexually explicit as the sweat funk air drying on a nude body after a four hour hump session.‘One Night’ is one of those books that will be devoured by pop-readers and literary readers alike. Reading Eric is like watching Jony Ive talk about design. Passion coupled with talent resulting in a product that changes the person using it. Yeah. That’s about right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351DBIZWJ6DXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954856#wasThisHelpful","R351DBIZWJ6DXS","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was recommended by a friend in my favorite FaceBook book group. I was looking for a good erotic thriller, and since I had just finished a book, the timing was perfect. Unfortunately, from the first page I could tell this was the work of a very green first time author. Now… because I know some of you, you’re going to take every word from here on out as a diss. It’s not. It’s just honest.To a number of readers (myself included) the experience of reading is just as important as the story. When I open a book and see one sentence paragraphs, bold writing, and italics all on the first page, it’s impossible not to cringe. But I kept on because I had already put my money down.I will say that the story itself isn’t bad. How it was told, was. Ricky is a good looking man who owns his own business and is engaged to Denise, an equally good looking woman. Denise ends up murdered and in order to find the killer, Ricky must enter the seedy world of porn. Not a bad premise at all. But the more I read ‘Stunt’ the more I found out that this was a very superficial story with nothing deep. It was like going from point A to point B to point C without telling us how we got there.There was even one glaring passage that the author used twice. This story also had a very strange tempo. Normally when you read a book you get into a certain flow with the words, with the characters, with the narrative, with the action. Not so with this one. It was like each chapter was racing to get done so the next one could start. And that’s really too bad because you can tell that Jet Black does have talent, it’s just very rough right now.The parts that I did enjoy were the sexual parts (oh, shut up). Very explicit and descriptive. There were a couple scenes where I was laughing when the author let us in on the thoughts of Stunt. And I’ve never wanted to be a cable guy so bad in my life.  Anyway, Stunt continues on his mission to find his lady’s killer and crosses paths with the true underbellies of crime. In the history of the world, porn has never once been a legitimate business, and this time is no different. Stunt tried to get me to believe that he hated having to hump his way to the culprits, but I wasn’t buying it. Especially when the road to redemption is between the thighs and cheeks of a stunning porn star! Come on now!This story does read fast and there is potential, but work needs to be done. I don’t mind the violence, the sex, or the brutality. But give me something to chew on, and not just a “surface story.”","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DFMYF2FLJ67E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692354301#wasThisHelpful","R2DFMYF2FLJ67E","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when I first heard rumblings about this book online. Ben Kane, Kate Quinn, and Stephanie Dray were sharing pictures, talking about Pompeiian history, and trading quips about their stories on FaceBook. The general public, (IE: me) just had to sit back and take it. Like a nineteen year old at a juice club, I could look but not touch. I’m sure Sophie Perinot, Vicky Alvear Shecter, and E. Knight were just as bad in this “tickle me, tease me, never release me it’s coming soon book” game. But at that time we weren’t connected on FaceBook so I couldn’t curse them under my breath like I could the previously mentioned three musketeers.Luckily my mother raised a Christian boy and I forgave all on release day. Except… there was a problem with initially finding it here in the U.S. So Christian boy loses part of his cool. Fine, I’ll get the eBook. Christian boy finds out that his iPad is no long accessible. Christian boy completely loses it and rains down enough curses to make Satan call Samuel Jackson and say “I think I found your apprentice.”Whatever.After patiently waiting a few weeks like a good Christian boy should, I was able to get the print book and all became well with the world again. (ISIS, Paris, Inflate-gate, and Kim Kardashian in a fur bikini not withstanding.)I didn’t read the synopsis about this book because I knew I was going to read it regardless. So I was a little puzzled as to why I kept hearing about the same characters and some of the same events. I knew this collection was going to be set in Pompeii, but I thought the authors were just going to write their own stories that took place whenever. Nope. All of these stories are intertwined with one another and it took me to story #3 to figure that out.  I was like, “didn’t I just read about Prima?” “Wasn’t that the Senator who…?” Once the dunce in me realized this, a light clicked on and I was “oooooohhhhhhh!”Because of this I started reading slower, I knew if I sped along I would miss something. I also went back and skimmed some passages because I wanted to be clear on certain events. You probably won’t have this problem because you had the good sense God gave you to read the synopsis and realize this was the format from the start.Vicky Alvear Shecter opens with ‘The Son’, a story that takes place in a brother. BONUS! If I wasn’t already sold on this book, I damn sure was now! Since the authors in this collection were working in tandem, Vicky sets the foundation perfectly. How do I know? Because by the time I got to the end of this book, the character that I absolutely HATED at the end of her story, I had the slightest bit of sympathy for. But only a little. Maybe it was because I knew how Caecilius felt all too well. (Calling Dr. Freud)Sophie Perinot continues this short-story collection with ‘The Heiress’. Here I’m introduced to Aemilia, Lady Diana, and Sabinus, appealing characters added to this to this story-puzzle. I was quite taken with Lady Diana but oddly drawn to the somewhat tortured soul, Sabinus.My friend Ben Kane (the only male contributor, lucky bastard) adds his flair with ‘The Soldier.’ Rufus adds a soldier/gladiatorial angle that I was looking for. If you’ve read any of Ben’s books you know why.‘The Senator’ by Kate Quinn follows and… wow.  Without throwing shade on any of the other authors, Kate’s story had me… had me… damn… it just had me. Witty and tragic with just the minimalist hint of hope. The scene with Marcus and Diana where he called her bizarre while she’s bandaging him up left me with my mouth gaped open! Her story is written beautifully. In other words, it matches her.E. Knight follows with ‘The Mother’, easily the emotional apex of this collection. And I don’t say that lightly. Not at all. With how this collection of short-stories is written, slowly moving along the Pompeii destruction timeline, E. Knight’s story is that straw that will take you over the edge. If your eyes don’t get even the slightest bit damp, then your life force is as black and dark as a tar pit.‘The Whore’ by Stephanie Dray is given the honor of being the coda. And she brings this book full circle with the character whom I hated… HATED in the first story. By this time in the series my heart was beating pretty fast. And even though I know (we all know) how Pompeii meets her end, I was hoping that even through all the death, ash, sulfur, and fear, there would be a different resolution.  But the last page sealed that deal. All too well. I must have read the ending it a few dozen times… (I just read it again.)I don’t know which Swiss chalet these author retreated to in order to create a book that flows and reads as well as ‘A Day of Fire’, but I only hope they are planning another. Each of the six stories had soul, fire, depth, sensuality, and despair. Each author was able to bring their style and meld it into the formula of the group.The end of this book has each author giving us a brief background of their story. It’s pretty sobering to have confirmed (yet again) that Pompeii was a city of people. People who were going about their daily lives, feeling and hearing the tremors, but not thinking much about it. Peoples who’s lives were so quickly and efficiently snuffed out that we knew exactly what they were doing at their time of death! That is a bad ass macabre move by Mount V.Setting aside all my bad jokes and tangents, I had a lot of fun reading this book. And it’s one that I will recommend to every one of my Roman reading buddies. Well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C1PN47VWG6VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990324575#wasThisHelpful","R2C1PN47VWG6VQ","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this case for free in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been an Otterbox user for YEARS. I’m also a reviewer/product tester and I’ve tried a hundred and one phone cases and I’ve always… ALWAYS gone back to Otterbox. So when the iPhone 6 came out that’s where I went. Now I don’t know of Otterbox had a change in leadership or what, but that case they have for the iPhone 6 SUCKS!So I went on an iPhone 6 case search. This ‘Anker’ is probably the 6th or 7th case that I’ve tried for my iPhone 6 and it’s not bad. Here are the pros and cons:Pro’s:It’s very slim.It fits well and feels good in your hand.It looks very nice and I like how it mimic’s the shape of the iPhone.The protection it gives feels solid. Your phone fits snug inside and the case holds together well.The volume and power buttons are responsive.Installation is easy.Con’s:The screen protector is made of a cheap material. It IS responsive but once it gets dirty it’s not easy to clean because of the material.The port coverings are a bit cumbersome. Since they actually fit inside the headphone jack and the lightning cable hole, if you don’t have them in there perfectly then the case won’t fit correctly. At least the bottom. This is a small deal, but a big enough one to mention.Removing the iPhone isn’t entirely easy. You almost feel as if going to damage the phone when you remove it because you have to press down on it to take it out.Overall this is a good case and one worth the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NB7E77X4RZWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTHU9BO#wasThisHelpful","R1NB7E77X4RZWM","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘The Bridge’ is the seventh book in the Hitch-Cole series originated by the legend Robert B. Parker and the third one written by Robert Knott. After a better than decent showing with ‘Bull River’, it was unfortunate to see Knott slip back to the mediocrity that made ‘Ironhorse’ so bad. This story simply does not have any bite, and the spirt of Hitch and Cole is nonexistent. I kept reading and reading and hoping and hoping that it would show up somewhere. Sadly, no.Even when we find out who did what, it was still kinda just… flat. Plodding would be the word to describe the goings on with this story. I kept hoping there would be one, just one, BAM! moment. But there wasn’t. There were a few semi-exciting parts and a couple semi-funny ones, but as a whole this story wasn’t engaging.Cole and Hitch are back in Appaloosa and things are relatively quiet. Virgil and Everett have built a house for Virgil and his lady, Allie, and Everett is being Everett. Life in the West, as they know it, is pretty good. But tranquility never lasts and soon Hitch and Cole are pulled back into the mix. This time out they have to find out who damaged a massive 200 foot bridge and why. This could almost be a western-mystery full of suspense and excitement, except for the total lack of suspense and excitement.The one “good” part of this book happens under gruesome circumstances. What happened to the sheriff and his two deputies was just… wrong. But it stood out because it was one of the few “whoa” parts. This was once an amazing Western series. The first four books (written by Parker) are ones that I still talk about and the ones I still handsell. Not so much now. And I DO want Knott to do well because Hitch and Cole are western literary icons. Not to mention that it’s no easy feat to pick up after a storyteller like Parker.Still… I would expect a better story than this. I don’t know how many more Hitch and Cole stories we’re going to get, but before they release the next one I hope Knott and company can root out the formula that they seemed to have found with ‘Bull River.’","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGKEWZGUCY3YB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171134#wasThisHelpful","RGKEWZGUCY3YB","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ll admit that I was a little apprehensive about this book when I heard that John Grisham was penning a female lead. Not because it was a female lead, but because he was SPECIFICALLY writing for a female lead. It seemed that instead of penning the damn story and letting the characters reveal themselves, he was trying to appease the spineless “everything must be equal” PC crowd. I don’t mind have a female as a lead character, but if it is meant to be then it will be. Don’t force it. The last time Grisham set out to base a book on a specific character was ‘The Racketeer’ and, in my humble opinion, that book was just… ‘good’.So I started this book with a bit of trepidation because I didn’t want it to be a book written to appease a certain group. Happily it was not. ‘Gray Mountain’ was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from a man whom I enjoy reading. 60% legal thriller, 40% thriller-thriller. That means this book had the classic Grisham legal dance, but there was also a lot of action that took place in the wild. The wild in this case being Appalachia. A beautiful and pristine part of the Eastern United States. Well… parts of it are beautiful and pristine. Other parts are… well… not much. The reasons why fuel the conflict wages within these pages.The coal companies have wages war on this land and the casualties are wide and plenty. Man, beast, land, air, and water have all felt the shame of being stripped, spread eagle, and violated all with the blessing of those meant to protect them. Now if you feel that last sentence was coarse you aren’t ready for this book. Grisham holds back nothing when it comes to describing the rape of the land by the coal companies. Nothing. Now I’m no tree hugger by a long shot. I think there are few things better than getting in a Jeep, finding an off-road trail, watching your passengers boobies jiggle, while having a good time. But any Jeeper will tell you (the responsible ones anyway) to ALWAYS “Jeep responsibly.” Have fun but don’t destroy the damn place.Apparently the coal companies didn’t get that memo. Or maybe they did get it and summarily ignored it like they have everything else having to do with the law, regulations, codes, or ethics. This fight over coal has been going on for a long time and our girl, Samantha Kofer, is about to go in. Samantha is a New York lawyer who has lived the good life since she was born. The product of two very ambitious parents who worked extremely hard and brought in a lot of money. It was interesting to watch Grisham write about her mom and dad. Workaholics that were neither negligent or attentive. I actually liked reading about the relationship Samantha had with her father. Interesting man with an entertaining life. Anyway…Samantha loses her $100,000+ a year (not including bonuses) job and is given the choice to work a year with a non-profit FOR FREE, with the possibility of maybe getting her job back. Unfortunately that possibility is slimmer than Stacey Dash jumping out of my birthday cake this year. She lands in Brady, Virginia a town with a population of 2,200 that is host to some of the most beautiful country this side of Eden. Coming from a background of D.C. and New York, Samantha not only experiences a culture shock, but a work shock as well. No longer dealing with the piles of paperwork that come from her job in big-law, she must immerses herself amongst everyday people who have everyday problems.She’s not snobby, just privileged. And in the course of learning new positions, new clients, new first world problems, and new cases she finds herself learning about the dark (hahahaha) world of coal. A classic case of catch-22. The coal companies bring in steady work and tons of money to the poor parts of the world. Life is good is only getting better. Unfortunately the bad side is bad. Dangerous working conditions, long hours, long term medical problems, and the worst of all, complete decimation of the surrounding environment.Samantha’s new employers have been veteran’s in this fight for a while but welcome an extra hand. Enter Donovan. Donovan is the catalyst for some much needed sexual tension, but it doesn’t turn out quite like you would expect. You see, Donovan is a quite the litigious rockstar with the locals yet quite the pariah with the local coal consortium. He’s a fighter but he doesn’t fight clean. By his logic if the coal mafia aren’t going to play by the rules, then neither will he. And while he might not have the typical groupies of a rockstar, he does stir passion with certain women. That sub-plot was fun. And like I said, it turns out like you wouldn’t expect and THAT was quite the twist.The ongoing litigation exposes a lot of the casualties of this war and they are not pretty. Grisham’s storytelling here is blunt as well. He delves into the medical history of the coal miners, their painful lives, their senseless deaths, the impact on the families, and the cruel aloofness and villainous acts of the coal companies. It may seem that reading about a fired lawyer taking on a coal company in the mountains of Appalachia may seem a bit boring. Motions, briefs, objections, judges, paperwork, billable hours, non-billable hours, clerks, and courtrooms all sound like the start of a snooze lecture for ‘Law 101’. Not so here. I finished this book in quick order for good reason. It’s Grisham telling a story, and I will never pass that up. While not being a heavyweight like ‘Sycamore Row’ (holy cow!) ‘Gray Mountain’ is a solid addition to the living storyteller legend that is John Grisham.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMXNR1F13JSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553714X#wasThisHelpful","RBMXNR1F13JSU","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I enjoy doing after watching a movie is hanging out to see who composed the music. Not only can you have a resolution phase after the movie, but you get a chance to hear more of the score minus that annoying movie dialogue. One of the first things that noticed immediately as I was watching ‘Addicted’ was the piano music. It wasn’t just ordinary piano music, it really stood out. The type of score you immediately train your brain to soak up as you watch the movie.The main title sets up this score of perfectly, and I do mean perfectly. (I’m listening to it now). It sound like ‘Addicted’ would sound if ‘Addicted’ were to sing. Or hum. Each movement is a beautifully orchestrated voice of the piece it is named after. The first thing I did after leaving the movie theater was search Google Play-Music to see if they had this score. They did.The second thing I did was add it to my playlists.And since October 10th I don’t think a day has gone by where I haven’t listened to this score, sometimes back to back. Now… as far as soundtracks go, this IS a pretty short one, coming in at just under forty-five minutes. It kind of makes sense because the movie is also a short one (1:40) as well. I don’t have a favorite movement because I sincerely love them all. As will you. I’m not sure how I managed to miss Aaron Zigman all this time, but it’s a mistake easily, and happily fixed.At the time of this review Amazon isn’t showing a track list so I’ve added one below.1.

"Brilliant high school kid gets paralyzed. He discovers that shark DNA could help repair his injuries. He steals some, injects himself, and becomes a 2014 version of Aquaman. ‘Flowers for Algernon’ meets HGH meets great white meets puberty.Sometimes it’s the books with the weirdest premises that turn out to be the best ones. This one certainly is. Steve Alten serves up another of his fast-paced thrill rides that is so good, it makes it impossible to do anything else. In the two days it took me to read this book I1. Burned dinner.2. Didn’t get to bed until after 12:30 AM.3. Was late for work once.4. Lied to a customer (and friend) so that I could get this book before him.5. Gave my little one a forty-five minute bath (normally it’s ten).6. Skipped my daily dose of “you ARE NOT the father” just so I could finish it.It’s a magnificent feeling to find a book that you hate to put down. Then again, Steve’s writing has always done that for me. In this story we meet Kwan. An assimilated Asian-American who is paralyzed, due to a spinal injury caused by an accident. Kwan is smart guy, but he’s also a paralyzed teenager with an extremely rigorous military father, aka sperm donor. And when you add the always present teenage male angst with a number of other incidents, you get the perfect storm.Most people (including me) would welcome having had their high school years in Florida. South Florida at that. But to Kwan it’s like a prison sentence having to adjust to a new high school in a wheelchair surrounded by other hormone induced angst ridden humans. His saving graces are a girl named Anya and the DNA of a bull shark.Kwan’s high school works with an aquatics genetics lab that specialized in stem cell research involving sharks. At first Kwan has zero interest until finds out that Anya is involved. Then hormones take over because, lets be honest, they always do, and he volunteers to becomes an intern in the program as well.Unfortunately nothing is as it seems and a story in the hands of Mr. Alten, even less so. There is a very dark underlying plot in this story that once I figured out, I wondered how the hell Steve was going to pull it off in such a short book.How foolish of me to doubt him.While the genetic facility IS doing edge-of-technology-science with shark stem cells, that is only a part of the whole. Our illustrious government has dug her claws in and you know when that happens, it’s only a matter of time before the fertilizer hits the fan. But let’s get back to Kwan… he’s fascinated at how far the science to cure people has come. It’s exciting, it’s cutting edge, and it’s within his reach. But he can also see and hear. He can see and hear the lab rats. The deformed, hurting, bleeding, squealing, grotesquely disfigured rats.You can’t make an omelet with breaking a few eggs right? Well you can’t experiment with something as radical as using shark stem cells without breaking a few spines or liquefying a few skulls.But in spite of seeing the rats, our modern-day Charlie Gordon decides that he wants to be whole again. There are some pretty extraordinary events that lead him to this decision, the least of which is feeling Anya’s breath or skin against his. With the help of an enemy (yeah I know, but read the book) Kwan sets his plan in motion. What happens is just FREAKING FREAKY! It’s also DAMN COOL! Steve can write y’all and I was just gone while I was reading this book!There are also a number of side-plots and characters that add fuel to this fire under the water. The sexy Sabeen - The assassin with a tortured soul and a lithe body. The Admiral – a father with a heart like Cordilleran. Rachel – the calming force. (I really liked her.) Joe – the crass scientist with insatiable lust for the female flesh (I REALLY liked him). And the star of the show… bull shark DNA.The science is uber-complex but Steve makes it understandable and fun on a layman’s level. The way he describes it I’d imagine he would be one hell of a fun teacher. From reading the ‘Meg’ series I understood some of the science, but everything else I learned on the fly and it didn’t slow the story down one bit. Anyway… once Kwan gets a taste of shark DNA his life takes a drastic turn. He’s surfing through it on cloud 9 fully unaware of the storm he’s causing.If you put a gun to my head and said, “Jason, say one bad thing about this book.” Well… after I disarmed you and put two in your kneecaps, I would say “it’s too short.” But not “too short” in a bad way. “Too short” in an ‘Omega Project’ sort of way.Don’t pass this book up because it’s ‘something that you would not normally read’. If you do then you are missing out on an author who has that “grab the reader” gift that so many claim, yet few actually possess.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X7HFNP3AMMT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCD2YL4#wasThisHelpful","R2X7HFNP3AMMT1","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One day I would like to interview Allison Hobbs and find out exactly where she gets the inspiration for her female characters. I just scanned her bibliography and yep, they’re all deranged. So it’s no surprise that the Lamda Nu chapter of Crazy Phi Nuts sorority is about to welcome a new member.And her name is Silk.Silk is a Louisiana born, light-skinned, sultry courtesan that seeps sexuality. Her caregiver, Big Mama, uses the voodoo power of the swamps to cast her spells. Silk uses the power of her snappy nappy. Actually… it’s not that nappy because she’s the devils’ mix of a white girl who enjoys the illicit desires of colored boys. Yeah I said colored. That’s because this novel takes place in the 1950’s and 60’s.Allison writes about juke joints, bus depots, Cadillac’s, special schools for colored children, and ice delivery. Ice delivery? WTH!? They used to deliver frikkin’ ice!? Unfortunately the payment that this iceman wanted was not paper. Or even copper or silver. And it damn sure wasn’t green. But let’s back up for a bit…Like I mentioned earlier, Silk was a walking sexual honeypot. At that time, light-skinned women in the deep South were usually light-skinned because of a soiled past. After dark and after the misses of the house was asleep, Massa became the sneaky white man who enjoyed forbidden sex with black girls. Most of that sex wasn’t consensual. Silk’s existence started with perversion somewhat like this and it only got worse. A few people are born with a natural depravity to all things moral, everyone else learns it. Silk learned from Professor Big Mama and Big Mama teaches at the University of Poontang. Baton Rogue campus.Their relationship is abnormal, their relationship is depraved, and their relationship is pervy. And I couldn’t get enough of it. It’s not hard to see where Silk learned her vile sexuality. She’s an evil and mean seductress. Men love her, women hate her, and I can’t believe God had the nerve to create her.After some murderous sexual adventures in the… swamp…where she lives, Silk takes her show on the road. The story she uses to get over on people is classic! Now Allison has written about some pretty sick women over the years, but there was something especially sick with Silk. It’s bad enough to have the thoughts she has, but to actually act out on them is another thing entirely.And no one is spared.Not the family she shacks up with, not the men she has fun with… not even the children. Silk works her demon like charms on everyone in this book (lord please help Ed the drivers Ed guy) and I can’t think of one person who didn’t fall for her charms. But while Silk may have the vagina from heaven, her soul is blacker than Wesley Snipes covered in oil at midnight on Halloween with his eyes closed.Allison’s ladies are sexual firecrackers that would make ANY man trade his blood for a taste of what they have. Unfortunately, her ladies are also devoid of the most basics of morals and will do anything or anyONE to get what they want. So… enter at your own risk. Haha, get it? “Enter at your own risk…?” Nevermind.Allison writes the way I love to read, with characters I love reading about. Going back and skimming this book to make sure I included what I wanted in this review, I found myself reading and looking for certain passages. THAT, dear people, is when you know you’ve found a good book. THIS is a good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3XCIOYN1WFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593095767#wasThisHelpful","RY3XCIOYN1WFU","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a case such as this, from Urban Armor Gear, for my iPhone 5s a few months ago. I liked the case, but coming from a background of Otterbox, I had gotten spoiled to a certain level of protection and that case didn't have exactly what I was looking for.This case was a tad bit different. It kept the same form and style of their previous model, but this one had a different… feel. I think part of what makes it different has a lot to do with the size of the iPhone. In this case the 4.7’ model.My hands are average size and having a larger phone means more real estate to grab, and this case offers a pretty good grip. Others have said that this case is slippery. They aren’t entirely wrong but I do think they are exaggerating just a bit. I don't fear dropping this case but it does sport a smooth touch. It also provides a snug grip for the phone that makes it feel very secure. It also makes it feel very good.Although I haven’t taken my phone out this case since I got it, for the purposes of this review I did. The fit is indeed (very) snug and it does take a little bit of effort to remove. But I look at that as a good thing. The method that worked for me was; gently pop out the bottom of the phone and then the top. Putting it back in was just as easy. Of course I had to admire just how gorgeous iPhone was before I put it back on. Sorry, I'm an Apple nerd.The buttons are responsive, easy to push, and well protected. The mute button remains uncovered however. The cut-out for the camera is ample, but not ugly, and I haven't had any issue with taking pictures flash or no. I really enjoy having the ports free so I just plug in to charge or plug in the headphones so can dance naked. They do give you a screen protector, but like last time, I didn't bother using it. It's very thin and I don't see what it could possible protect. I do like the microfiber cloth they sent though.If there was one thing I would change (not much though), this case would have a tad bit bigger lip around the phone. If you lay this case down on its face the screen of your phone WILL NOT touch the surface, but the space is small. I understand the reasoning why, but seeing as the screen is THE most important part of the iPhone, and I would appreciate a bit more protection.All in all this is a very good case. It doesn't take away from the beauty of the iPhone and even manages to add a little with the unique looking back and the choice of colors.Quick add: I went to a wedding this past weekend in Coloma, CA and I took my phone in this case. This place was rustic, rural, and very outdoorsy. (If you get a chance to go, do it. That place is gorgeous!) Anyway… I was at ease having my phone out and about taking pictures, taking video, and sharing them by passing around my iPhone to the ladies wearing short dresses in the bridal shower. And I’m slowly getting comfortable with not having a screen protector. Slowly. ☺","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P28Z2P301OGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCAVUGA#wasThisHelpful","R1P28Z2P301OGG","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been the ""s"" upgrade guy. Way back since the 3Gs I've always done the ""upgrade every two years"" thing. Because of that I've always had the luck to have an entire year for Otterbox to perfect their iPhone Defender cases. Any imperfections they found in the initial launch of the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5 cases would be worked out by the time the iPhone 3Gs, iPhone 4s, and iPhone 5s cases came out. I enjoyed that little bit of (if not unscientific or rational) breathing room.This year was the first year I upgraded early, so I was curious to see if Otterbox would make a perfect case with the launch of a new iPhone model. Unfortunately they haven't. They have made an ""OK"" case, but it has one major flaw that they need to fix fast and numerous tiny flaws that I'll just have tolerate.The fingerprint sensor is the major flaw.On the 5s case there is a cutout to place your finger so there was nothing between your skin and the sensor. And the technology worked perfectly. With the iPhone 6 case there is a thin plastic shield over it and it doesn't work AT ALL. How in the world did this even pass testing!? I've been sitting here while I write this review testing it over and over again thinking it might be my finger (haha). No. The plastic over the sensor is a MAJOR hinderance to the use of this phone. And seeing how heavily Apple Pay is being touted as well as the opening of the touch sensor to third party developers, that is reason enough to not buy this case.Now I did notice that when I took the case off, the plastic covering that is over the fingerprint sensor almost looked like it was placed there as an afterthought. It would seem to me that if this design was planned, it would be a part of the entire plastic face covering and not a separate piece altogether. That lead me to assume that this was a PR move. One of the major complaints of the 5s Defender case was that the cutout for the fingerprint sensor let in dust. I guess enough people complained and OB decided to ""fix"" it. I wish they wouldn't have. They only made it worse. What I'm going to try and do, if I'm brave enough, is to try and pry that small piece of plastic off. I'll let you know in an update if and when I do this.Another problem with this case are the buttons that cover the power and volume are very hard to press. Very. You have to exert extra pressure just to get them to work. This being a new case I can understand the stiffness of it being new. But having purchased over 15-20 OB cases over the years I don't think that is the only reason. One thing that you should know is that as I write this review I have my iPhone 6 next to me testing and testing just to make sure that I'm being fair. I am. Those buttons are really bad.The touch screen isn't as responsive as previous models either. New people switching to Otterbox probably won't notice. But when OB has been your case of choice for years, you noticed the difference. It's not as bad as the Lifeproof screen protector, but it is worse than the 4s and 5s screen protector. I just checked their website and found this statement about the fingerprint sensor:Protective membrane cradles the Touch ID to block dust and debris and enhance device functionality.So it IS supposed to be there. I'll leave it up to you but I took mine off.The plus side is that the protection on the Otterbox case hasn't suffered. The plastic shell is sturdy as you would expect and the outer rubber/silicone (I can't tell which) feel good in your hands. I was super careful with my iPhone before I got this case and now I feel so much better because I do trust the Otterbox brand. Which is why I didn't hesitate to buy this case. Unfortunately now that I have, I wish I could return it and look for something better. At the beginning of this review I mentioned that I was skeptical if OB could make a decent case for a new model out the door.I have to say that the answer is no.The best part about this case is the storied protection it provides. The problems arise in the applications that are married with it. The EXPERIENCE of using this iPhone 6 case takes away from the PROTECTION of this iPhone 6 case. The good news is, these problems can be easily fixed. The bad news is, I wish it hadn't cost me almost $60 to find this out.For the first time in a long time, if not ever, I can not recommend this Otterbox case. Maybe after they've had some time to fix these problems, yes. But not now.Side notes:This is a nice looking case, but unlike the 4s or 5s, it doesn't mirror the look of the phone it covers.The hole over the fingerprint sensor isn't centered.Otterbox brought back the raised area around the fingerprint sensor to give it more protection when/if you drop it. To me, it doesn't interfere with the workings of the sensor nor does it feel weird or intrusive.*UPDATE* - OK, I couldn't stand that piece covering the fingerprint sensor so I took it off. Took me all of ten minutes to do so. You know what it was? Thick tape. What the heck Otterbox? Was this supposed to be on there? I looked back through my box and there was no instruction on whether we should take that off or leave it on. Interesting. Now that that thick tape is gone the fingerprint sensor works perfectly.9/21/2014 Update:After having this case on all day yesterday and this morning I have come to the decision that I'm going to return it. This case is absolutely nothing like the previous Otterbox cases. It's almost like they didn't follow the standard they had already set. It's pretty bad when a case takes away from the experience of the phone. But the volume buttons and the power buttons are a chore to press and the screen protector is very unresponsive.I truly hope they fix this case because it is NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the previous models.**UPDATE**January 4, 2015Well... I waited until I felt enough time had passed for Otterbox to fix the problems they had with the initial launch of the Defender case for the iPhone 6. Unfortunately the issues that I had; stiff volume and power buttons, below par screen protector, and that annoying taped over fingerprint sensor protector... are still there.Not one thing was changed.So I will return this case (for the second time) and I will not be purchasing another. For some reason Otterbox has refused to fix these problems and, in my opinion, have done damage to their brand. And that's too bad because this used to be the ONLY case I used for my iPhones. Not anymore.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ZB23KXXZSV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1AFSFS#wasThisHelpful","R28ZB23KXXZSV6","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The number of books that I’ve re-read are few and far between, kind of like thongs at a Omega Psi Phi toga party. But when I heard that Zane’s book ‘Addicted’ was being made into a movie, I knew that I would revisit it. And indeed I have done so. I was curious to see how long it has been since I read this book last, and after a semi-quick search on (ugh) Amazon, I found out. 2006. 2006 was the first time I read ‘Addicted’ by Zane. Eight years have passed since I read from the TRUE queen of erotica’s second novel.Just for kicks I went back to see what I wrote in my first review of this book. Looking back at that review I felt like an artist at the age of fifty looking back on his works he did as a child. A lot of things have changed since then, including my feelings about this book. I did enjoy it (again, I don’t normally re-read books, even less so books that I didn’t like) but I saw it from a different perspective this time.I think Zoe is less ‘addicted’ and more like extremely unsatisfied with her sex life with her semi-eunuch husband. Punk ass. Jason, Zoe’s spouse, has a fire hot sexy wife who wants nothing more than to please her husband in every way possible. He loves her, yes, but he’s scared of her. Well… rather he’s scared of her… well, you know. Zoe tries to fix the problem but you know the saying, “you can lead a man to water but you can’t make him lick.”So with her being fed up with sharing her bed with a lover who gives her no loving, Zoe starts to weaken. A person can only be rejected so many times before desire starts to send out her hormones. Zoe’s estrogens are the smell of honeysuckle. And honeysuckle is sweet to everyone. And it doesn’t take long for someone(s) to taste her flower.It has been said, “if a man has not ever wanted to kill a woman, that man has never been in love.” I will add, “if you’ve never risked all for an orgasm, then you’ve never been horny with no sight of relief.” OK… maybe that isn’t as poetic and full of crap… but still. Being horny sucks! Just ask Zoe.Zane has always been the author who makes me laugh with her wit and having her characters say the most unimaginable things. ‘Addicted’ brought back memories of that. It also brought back high school memories. A lot of the references in the story made me smile and reminisce. I probably would have finished this book a lot quicker if I didn’t take so many walks down memory lane. Anyway… where was I? Zoe… horny… itch… orgasm… oh yeah now I remember!As innocently immoral as Zoe’s decisions were, all she wanted was for HER man to desire her above all else. She never expected her desires to lead to this. What is “this?” Crack open this book and find out. An orgasm is good, damn great even. But at what cost? Is Zoe addicted or just misunderstood, lonely, and horny? While this was a good read by Zane, it is also one her less sexual ventures. The sexuality is there, just not to the extent of her other books. Not in a bad way, just different.I’ve been a fan of Zane’s for a long time now and I am so happy that she is going to be on the big screen! I hope you will join me in coming out and showing out on the opening weekend for ‘Addicted’ the movie. The weekend of October 10th Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Pick a day, pick some friends, pick a theater, take pictures, and share them with the world. Zane has given us years of sensual erotic reading, we can certainly give her a weekend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16J29Y4HLZRXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBJFGE#wasThisHelpful","R16J29Y4HLZRXQ","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few weeks ago I was on FaceBook lamenting the fact that I couldn’t get any of Robert Fabbri’s books in digital format here in the U.S. Oh I could get the printed books from across the pond, but I was looking to read his books NOW! As typical of most book lovers, I have zero patience for waiting when I set my mind to reading something. Not to mention a distaste for certain (ahem) book-hating company. Robert actually responded and said that he was sorry but it looked liked I would need to sell my soul and get it from the book-hating company.So just for giggles, I opened a window to check and see if his books were available in digital format… and would you believe that the first three books in the Vespasian series were available as a set!? It took me all of four seconds to head over to iTunes and buy it. Roman-fiction is what I enjoy reading the most and I’ve heard Robert Fabbri’s name come up more than a few times, but his books were always just out of reach to us U.S. folk.Not anymore! The flood gates have opened and all I can do is rejoice!And trust me, this series is as good as you’ve heard. Maybe even a little better. I can always tell when I’m into a book when I must force myself to stop and when I get excited when I know I’ll be able pick up reading it again. Since I bought this as a set I’ll write it up as such…The principal character is this series is Vespasian and just to let you know how vast this series is, ‘Tribune of Rome’ starts out with his birth. Of course the story moves along and by chapter 1 Vespasian has aged greatly. But still…I read these books with the same fervor like a fat kid at a candy buffet that serves caramel Kool-Aid. As we follow the life of Vespasian, we find that each book has it’s own style and flavor. Each book also has a cast of characters with more color than an exploding rainbow that gorged itself on skittles. Wait… that’s not a good reference. Each book also has a cast of characters with more color than a skittle taking a rainbow shower. (OK never mind, these are just getting worse)You have the main characters like Vespasian, Sabinus, Gaius, Titus and Caligula who provide the porterhouse portion of the story. Then you have Magnus, Pallas, Claudius, and Antonia who provide the potato slathered in butter. Caenis provides the dessert. Among the many things that drew me to this story, one big part was how you could never guess where the story was headed. Matter of fact, if they hadn’t titled this series ‘Vespasian’, I doubt I would have known he was the focal point based on the first book.One of my buddies came in our book-office today and I was telling him about this series. I told him that it rivaled another famous Roman author we both enjoy. In each book there is the ideal blend of blood, politics, and brutality. There were times, though, where one would overpower the other. Book #2 (‘Rome's Executioner’), there were some very heavy political overtones. Not “bad”, but after reading book #1 (‘Tribune of Rome’) and the action that had, it just felt different. And to be fair, it wasn’t the whole book, just certain parts.After those small hiccups we’re back in the glorified brutality of Rome. Travels to Egypt, dealing with psychotic emperors, lusting after slave cunny, battles in blood, and a little controversy thrown in. Yeah, not sure if Fabbri was trying to rankle the Christian population on purpose, but he has some very interesting theories on Christ, Christianity, and the Disciples. Especially Paul. Oh I had a good laugh with how he was portrayed. I enjoyed how the crucification played a part in this series but didn’t overshadow the story. Very well played Robert.Want to know what really shook the hell out me? The ending of book #2. Easily one of the most savage endings of a book that I’ve read in a LOOOOOOONG time. I went back and had to reread that entire section because it was just… damn. At the end of each book Robert gives us his ‘author’s notes.’ He tells us where he took liberties and where he used actual history. It didn’t help me at all to find out that the end of #2 was true. Double damn.I mentioned earlier that this series is like a porterhouse. And as impossible as this is going to sound, Caligula, was the seasoning for the potatoes. This demented soul makes his entrance in a very normal manner… by the time we get to book #3 (‘False God of Rome’), Caligula is FULL BLOWN! We’ve heard of his repulsive depravities… but still. Robert doesn’t hold back in the least. Oh and about that… I’ve read a ton of Roman-esque books and I’ve noticed that the first book is always the most brutal, the most rapacious, the most blood soaked. Then it seems that someone complained it was too severe and the next book was watered down. I’ve seen this more than a few times and it drives me NUTS!Not so with this series.Robert started with gory assault and didn’t let up. Did I mention the ending of book #2? I did? OK. Caligula doesn’t disappoint and he will make your heartbeat match those of the characters. I very rarely read a series back-to-back-to-back but I couldn’t help it with this one. There are some books I recommend, some books I highly recommend, and others I wish I had the money to buy everyone I know a copy. This series is one of the “buy a copy for the masses” one. If you even remotely enjoy Roman fiction, put this series immediate on your ‘to read’ list.The fourth book in this series is called ‘Rome’s Fallen Eagle’ and is available now. ‘Masters of Rome’ is book #5 and is not available here in the U.S. quite yet. But you can believe that I will keep an eye out.‘Tribune of Rome’‘Rome's Executioner’‘False God of Rome’‘Rome’s Fallen Eagle’‘Masters of Rome’","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XSEYZ7P3CQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KEW8KAG#wasThisHelpful","R27XSEYZ7P3CQH","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first took this case out the package I thought the case felt a little feeble. It is mostly a rubber shell that sits inside a plastic shell and your phone sits inside that. When you put your iPhone in it does bolster the case a little, but not by much. The grip is also very smooth, almost to the point of being slick. The grip is OK but I see it causing problems, especially if your hands are the least bit sweaty or wet.The phone slips in and out with ease and the case fits pretty nicely. The weakness shows around the rubber lip that allows you to place your iPhone face down. It moves easily and feels very weak, especially around the home button. Fitting this case in your pocket is effortless as well.Also, unlike my current case, it has the charging port and the headphone port easily accessible without having to move any flaps. This is a case that I would use every once in a while, but it would not be my everyday case because it doesn’t provide the type of protection I need.  It’s not a BAD case, just not a very protective one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4Y1VO1SEYCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMPXGOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1F4Y1VO1SEYCS","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I hate giving out my eMail to be notified of stuff, I might have to reconsider since I missed the release of Simon Scarrow’s new eBook by almost a month. As I’m prone to do on a regular basis, I was trolling around looking for something new to read.  Somehow I came across this new one by Scarrow and Andrews and yelled at my computer! I HATE missing new releases from authors I enjoy, so I promptly went over to the website and signed up for his newsletter.Then I bought the eBook.This is the first installment in the new ‘Invader’ series and it is damn good! But I warn you, it reads very fast so be ready for that. The setting is familiar, fighting in Britannia on the island of Vectis, but the characters are different. At just around 300 pages Simon sets the stage for us to like, loathe, root for, and hope for death these new characters.Rome might have been glorious, but she also had her fair share of corruption. Understatement of the week right? Enter Centurion Ocella. Prideful, stupid, arrogant, and a pain-in-the-gladius. Then there is Option Figulus. A soldier’s soldier and a man who shuns the spotlight. You just know these two are going to go heads up!Simon gives us a short-story that is only a small morsel of a bigger meal. But damn… this morsel is prime Grade-A served on Pickard China with a dry red on Lord Howe Island with Misty Copeland as the waitress. If I seem a little over the top, so be it. One thing that Simon does well is putting you front and center of the action. His descriptions of battle are as exciting as they are bloodthirsty. There were a few parts that I read twice. Twice because I literally cringed the first time I read it.Friendships are forged, enemies are destroyed, “important” men swindle their way in front of better men, and no rest is had for a weary brave legionary. When writing a story that will be an ongoing series, too many author make the mistake of wasting time setting up the story while the story becomes a damn blood bore! Simon doesn’t have that problem and as a reader, I’m happy as a clam. The setting up of the characters is done with the deft skill of an author who knows what the hell he’s doing.Their last series were five eBook novellas that were released about two months apart.

"‘Blood of Rome: Retribution”I read the first book (‘Blood of Rome: Caratacus’) in this series about three weeks ago. And despite a few validated issues, I knew I was going to read book two. And read it I did. And read it I enjoyed. While ‘Caratacus’ dealt with the fight for Britannia… oh wait sorry… the fight for Albion mainly through the eyes of the scouts, ‘Retribution’ deals with it through the eyes of the soldiers as well as through the eyes of Caratacus… oh wait sorry… Caradoc.John Salter treats us with another well-told story about Rome and her (failed?) attempt to conquer Albion. Rome is determined, Caratacus is defiant, the fields are flush with guts, and blood flows free like the Nile. We’re also given backstory on Caracatus, which is almost a second story in itself. I found that to be particularly entertaining. While I will always pull for Rome, I can appreciate the story of those she fought to overpower. Rebellion in any form makes for good story!The story of the three brothers could easily be its own story, especially in the hands of Mr. Salter. Once you read about the backstory of those three, the title ‘Retribution’ makes perfect sense.Soldiers, legionaries, Generals, and auxiliaries. All fighting and dying for the great glory of Rome! There is surprisingly a lot of story in such a “short” (269 pages) book. There is also one surprise from book one that I didn’t see coming. One that made my blood boil and one that had me really looking and paying attention to the goings on in this story.The grammatical errors took a major dip in this book but they were still there. Maybe by book three (yes, there will be a third book!) they will disappear all together. I only bring this up because John did. And it does matter.John is a very welcomed voice in the growing field of Rome historical-fiction. I have absolutely have no problem recommending John’s work to anyone looking for a good Roman story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5IMHXSQF50F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0W5ZCS#wasThisHelpful","R3T5IMHXSQF50F","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Demented: adjectiveThe paranoia of a demented old man: mad, insane, deranged, psychotic, out of one's mind, crazed, lunatic, unbalanced, unhinged, disturbed, non compos mentis; informal crazy, mental, psycho, off one's rocker, nutty, around the bend, raving mad, batty, cuckoo.Courtnie Randolph: noun*See above definitionDamn. Why are all the crazy sex fiend women crazy? Because normal girls don’t make you cry in bad, that’s why. Courtnie is a woman who has the skills, the means, and the ability to make anyone, man or woman; lose their mind in the bedroom. One sip of her and you will forget everyone and everyTHING! Yeah… her stuff is that yummy.But yummy comes at a price. Courtnie will stamp your passport to sexual heaven, but the return trip goes through hell. As you read this short-story you’ll see why I call this woman ‘demented.’ Sexually, normal woman only give you the sex need to be OK. Complacent. Semi-happy.Crazy woman give you the sex your body wants! Craves. Desires. Longs for.Over the years Courtnie has amassed more than a few lovers to feed her need. They all enjoy her until they realize she’s a few plastic bracelets short of a grab bag. But Courtnie can’t just let them go. If you taste her then she feels you’ve become a part of her DNA and that you’re a part of her forever. You can try and leave if you want… but results aren’t pretty.Adonis Edwards is married to a woman who accuses him of having an affair AND not giving him any. Idiot. Especially since his name is also his description.Enter Courtnie. And yes, that is a double entendre. She gives him what his wife won’t and gives it to him GOOD. But while Adonis thinks that this one-night stand is just a quick jump-off, bat-ass crazy Courtnie plays the role of penguin and wants to mate for life.Adonis finds out the hard way (another double entendre, but you’ll have to read this book to figure it out) that there is no leaving this nut. This short-story is very sexual throughout and very sadistic in parts. That curling iron scene is still playing in my head. Not to mention the scenes where you find out just how bloody mental this woman truly is.There were a few areas of non-consistency that were a bit distracting and annoying but all in all I had a fun time reading. I think you will as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7GOUSTF53H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX9HREM#wasThisHelpful","R1X7GOUSTF53H0","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say right off the bat that I’m a diehard Otterbox fan. Have been since the iPhone 4. Now that doesn’t mean that I haven’t had problems with them, but I’ve tested a LOT of cases over the years and Otterbox, even with it’s issues, has outshone them all.So when Urban Armor Gear sent me an eMail asking if I would review one of their cases I almost passed. I reviewed a case a few weeks back and I try to space them out. But then I went to UAG’s website and immediately changed my mind because of one thing: the case looked bomb!I’m usually not a sucker for how a case looks, “can it protect?” is the more immediate question. But after reading on the site about it and looking at a few YouTube videos I decided to give it a shot.When I got this case I immediately opened it and put it on. What I didn’t expect was how SNUG this case is. Holy cow! But that’s a good holy cow. It took a little effort to get my iPhone out of the case so be warned… clean your phone and make sure she’s nice and pristine BEFORE dressing her with this case. It’s not a big hassle and ultimately you want a snug fit… just have a little patience before putting it on. Patience has never been my strong suit.This case does come with a screen protector that you put on yourself. I tried for a minute and then quit. It’s very thin and I guess the protection it serves is for scratches and nothing else. Also, once you put it on you have to do that pressing/iron out thing to get rid of the air bubbles. No thanks.Unfortunately, screen protection is an area where most iPhone case makers fail. The screen protector is either too loose and creates a small air bubble, there is no screen protector at all, or it has a screen protector and you get that oily looking thing. Because the accompanying scree protector wasn’t one that I liked, I took the chance to use this case without it. I usually shun cases that do not have a screen cover because my luck is such that if I did drop my iPhone it would be at the perfect angle where it was land on the screen and “poof.”So far though I feel pretty safe with this case. And I think the reason is, I’m getting a decent amount of protection plus I LOVE have access to every port and button without having to move a rubber covering. Everything has a trade off and I think that just may be mine.Pros- Very snug fitting.- Access to every button and port without having to open/close rubber flaps.- Looks very nice on your iPhone.- Smooth fit that makes going in and out of your pocket a breeze.- Does not add much bulk to the iPhone.Cons- Screen protector is weak and flimsy.- The “lip” around the front of the iPhone is very thin and doesn’t look to be very promising if you drop your iPhone on it’s face.Final say:After almost a week with this case I would have to say that I’m pleased with it. In a perfect world I’d want a more sturdy screen cover and a bigger lip for better screen protection. I did find myself being a little more careful (not much though) with this case than my Otterbox because of the reasons I mentioned earlier. But I did find myself loving the convenience of having access to all the ports.I’m not that guy that has the stones to drop my phone to test out a new case so I can’t tell you how it fares with that. If I happen to drop it I will update this review with the results.Thank you to ‘Urban Armor Gear’ for sending me this case for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27V7YEYPRBICH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099I81IM#wasThisHelpful","R27V7YEYPRBICH","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to grab me from the jump with your book, the best way to do that is with sex or violence. ‘The White House’ opens with both so you KNOW my nose was wide open! JaQuavis offers us a solo performance this time out and shorter one as well. What I didn’t know was that this short story is based on real life events.What we have is a sexy maid who sees an easy way to brick up her bank account. She works for a wealthy couple and she happens upon something one day she shouldn’t have seen. As typical with hood rats, her mind starts to work to plan a way to get that loot. Couple of problems here:1. Woman, did you pay attention to whom you were working for?2. Look at the job you have now, did you really think that someone with your brains and “talent” could pull this off?Judging by the way this story unfolds I would have to say that neither of those questions entered her mind. Now, I’m not mad at Draya for taking advantage of a situation, just at how she did it. I know I’ve seen people on TV who find a substantial amount of money and gave it back. Every time I see something that I wanna echo Dr. Dre on the ‘Chronic’ album and go “Brotha… is you crazy!?”It’s past time for this man to make a withdrawal from the bank of life. Draya thought the same thing and made moves to change that. Stupid moves (dumb as hell moves) mind you, but moves all the same.I also enjoyed the way JaQuavis told us just enough but didn’t give away who the second person was in the opening prologue. (You remember don’t you? That violent and sex fueled montage?) He drops hints throughout ‘The White House’ and one you think you have the right person… BAM… that person meets the Grim Reaper. And they do so usually missing a few gallons of blood and a limb or three.This wasn’t a crime who-done-it but rather a clever telling of a street short story. You’d think that hearing about another street story from JaQuavis would get monotonous. You’d be wrong. Oh there’s your usual brutal violence, revenge, sex, and backstabbing no doubt, but the magic is seeing how he blends that together inside of a story that doesn’t seem recycled.If you’re looking for a quick read that you could easily do in one sitting, give this one a shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DRN09FP24O97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK47P70#wasThisHelpful","R2DRN09FP24O97","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been almost two years since we’ve last heard from Cade and Zach.  Two years of Chris having to fend off angry Twitter followers, two years of responding (or flat out ignoring) angry eMails from “concerned fans”, two year of hearing “when’s the next book coming out?”,“When will Cade be back?”,“When can I next read about Cade’s hot on and off again girlfriend?”.  OK I admit that last one was me… but you get the idea.Chris tried to put these questions to rest in his blog but no one cared.  No one gave a damn.  We’re book lovers, and anything short of death will not be forgiven if you don’t give us our next fix.  And even in death, it better be one hell of an accident and not self induced or something as pathetic as going natural.No.  We want our next Cade, so get off your ass and get it done.And by done, I mean yesterday.With ‘The Burning Men’, Chris sates our appetite just a little.  This is a short story that brings back our favorite undead government employee Cade.  He and Zach are on the trail of… something.  All they know that whatever it is, it has a nasty habit of having an impromptu barbeque with people as the meat.The dark humor is still here as well as the fast action.  Made faster as this is a short story.  One can infer (hope might be a better word) that there will be more to this story in another short or in a full novel.  I certainly hope he brings back Dr. Ramos.  Anyone who has that reaction toward Cade deserves a chance to see how it plays out.If you’ve read Chris’s other works then you will certainly enjoy this.  And depending on which Amazon write-up you believe this book is between 34 and 52 pages.  All that fancy algorithm and they can’t even count.Either way I was just happy to hear that I could read about Cade again, even if it was just a little bit.  Chris put out a blast on Twitter and the news caught fire like… well like the dudes in this book.  Of course it was minus the seared skin, burnt bowels, singed hair, and the worst smell of them all, burnt popcorn.Thanks for the tease Mr. Farnsworth.

"There are times when I don’t know whether or not to finish reading Allison Hobb’s books or throw them through the damn window.  This one was no different.  No wait… actually this one was a little worse.  Usually there is one character in her books that I hate with a passion.This time there were two.Vanessa and Spike.I swear if there were two other people better suited for the ‘Darwin Awards’, I damn sure would like to meet them.  Vanessa is a sister who is married to a white guy.  She loves this white guy and she enjoys her life with this white guy.  Problem is, she loves to enjoy the… ummm… special tools of certain blessed brothers.  Her husband is lacking in a certain area, and because of this, once a month he allows his wife to satisfy her sexual needs with a Mandingo.  One catch though… Spike has to watch.So this white guy not only helps his wife find and sleep with other men, he is a willing voyeur to that immoral decadence.  But this is an Allison Hobbs story so you know there is something else simmering just below the surface.  The sex that Vanessa needs to have is rough, hard, and sloppy.  Her jump-offs not only need to have large packages but they need to know how to use them.  And use them right.  After reading a few of her adventures I don’t see how this woman gets around without a wheelchair!During their sexual escapades, Vanessa and Spike (BTW, Spike has a name is that a complete 180 from his actual nature) meet Quincy.  Quincy is a man who always gets what he wants and what he wants is Vanessa.  What he does with to her is as erotic as it is wrong.  He has that married woman twisted like a pretzel doing nude yoga.  I’ve heard of sexual domination but Quincy takes it to another level by dominating not only the wife… but also the weak ass husband.Spike… they straight punked this fool!  It’s one thing being whipped by your woman good-good, but damn Spike really!?  And Vanessa… only Allison could write about a freak that still has a bigger freak inside her.  And I’m not gonna lie, Vanessa had a porno going on in her life and I was almost as bad as Spike with wanting to watch it.‘Make Me Beg’ is what we’ve come to expect from Allison.  Steamy, hot, raunchy sex with a cup and a half of depravity.  Perfect for readers such as myself… (and you too you freaks!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EVDIVU1KFJH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTMWULO#wasThisHelpful","R1EVDIVU1KFJH6","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"eBooks have taken on a few different faces.  There is the ""I'm going to publish my book digitally because I don't want to deal with a traditional publisher"" face.  There is the ""I'm going to publish my book in print form and digital form because I want people to read my work"" face.  There is the ""I'm going to put out an eBook in-between my major releases because I need to make money"" face.  There is the ""I'm going to put out an eBook because I want my fans to have something to read until my major release"" face.  There there are the authors like Mosley who (in my opinion) publishes eBooks because, if they don't get their story out, they will simply and grotesquely explode.  Nothing ruins your day like seeing the entrails of your favorite author on the floor of Starbucks.Some people write to live, other live to write.  Mosley, it seems, writes in order not to die.  'Odyssey' has all the strength and literary of Mosley, in a shorter story.  I really HATE some of the book synopsis they have on Amazon.  They way this one is written it makes you think that this story is only about Sovereign and his blindness.  Yes AND no.  His blindness plays a part but I submit that the meat of this story are the lives lived before Sovereign, the lives lived with Sovereign, and the lives lived around Sovereign.  Mosley is one of the (very) few authors who has the talent to make his supporting characters as interesting as the main characters.  Drum-Eddie, the shrink, and Toni.  Oh my sweet lord Toni!  Even now I'm thinking back to that gorgeous, beautiful, mocha skinned female.  I know we're told that another incident cause Sovy's sight to return for a bit... but in the recesses of my mind I believe it's Toni.  Who needs a doctor with a blue pill when you have a woman in black panties?But Toni's charm doesn't stop at her perfect palm sized curves, her part in this story will confuse you.  Oh her presence makes sense IN the story, but her presence in Sovy's life is the the confusion... actually that's not a good word to use... let's try... disorientation.  Yeah, that's a better word.  Sovereign's life is menu of disorientation.  Childhood, adulthood, Toni-hood.Another interesting aspect to this story is Sovy's view what race should be hired and HOW they should be hired.  Weird interjections throughout the story with that but with the prevalent disorientation in this story, Mosley makes it work.  Throughout Mosley's books you always have this strong underlying current of street, or rather, real life philosophy.  Not all philosophy is born chanting on a mountain surrounded by clouds.  A lot of it is born in the gutter surrounded by filth.  The child of philosophy making love to reality is truth.  Sovereign's truth must have had parents who were first cousins.And then there's the ending... if you only read it once then you are a fool.  I'm three days removed from finishing this book and I'm STILL re-reading it!  This story is awash in disorientation so it only makes sense that the ending would paramount. Not sure how many times I can, or need to say it, but Walter Mosley is the man.  Not only is he a writer among writers but he's the author that writers read when they want to read something great.  If you think I'm kidding, ask them.  If they smile... there's your answer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLJ4TYYHCGTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DK8AQ8U#wasThisHelpful","R2JLJ4TYYHCGTV","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an angel at Simon & Schuster who sends me boxes of books from time to time.  This book was amongst her latest offerings and it showed up at just the right time.  When I opened the book I found a form letter written by one of the editors giving this book glowing recommendations.  Immediately my ""BS"" meter clicked on because really, what do you expect an editor to say about a book they worked on?That it sucked?  That they should use better discretion when signing new writers?  That the only thing worse would be if Danielle Steele and Nora Roberts collaborated on a new series?  No, you expect them to praise and laud their new author like their the next Roman Emperor. So I'm always wary when I see high praise for a first time author with a new book, even an author who has quite the entertainment resume like Drew.  ""Reader beware"" right?Well... not this time.  This time the book matches the praise given.Like the editor I couldn't put this book down.  It's blazing fast and it almost feels as if it's written like you aren't supposed to read it slow.  Did you ever wonder what the love child of Danica McKellar and Jason Bourne would be like?  No?  Yeah well... me either.  But for the sake of this review just go along with me.  Garrett Reilly is a numbers genius. Actually that's not entirely true. He's the type of numbers genius that other number geniuses hate. (Along with a majority of us normal intelligence folk).But Reilly has another amazing trait that stands out that causes people to hate him, he's a total dick. His intelligence comes with heightened sense of self and he's a master at using it. He has no problem getting into into a bar fight or getting into a barmaid. To him they serve the same purpose. He burns crazy amounts of testosterone while screaming and pumping his... err... fists. But no matter how uninhibited the barmaid or how satisfying the head butt, Reilly's first lust is numbers.Unfortunately, like most lustful endeavors, it'll get you in trouble. And Reilly is deep in it. He's seen a sinister numbers pattern in the U.S. treasury as well as something else a bit more ominous. Someone is trying to royally screw with the United States and the U.S. Military needs Reilly's help to track them down.Good luck with that.Reilly's bad attitude extends to most everything, but nothing faces his ire like the U.S. Military.  Even if one part of the military is a drop dead gorgeous woman with muscles and soft parts in all the right places. But will she use her womanly charms for good or evil?The different forms of conflict that take place in this book are a thrill to read.  You never really know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Well, except for the enemy, we find out who those fools are pretty early. And the enemy in this book is pure-D ruthless.  They are waging a new war against U.S. and for a new war you need a new soldier. Their strikes are done with precision and while our leaders are bickering over who gets credit for what, our enemy is planning another surgical strike. And trust me here people, these strikes are bad. And by bad I mean ""whoop-ass""!Drew is a very good at not holding back when the story dictates a certain path. I enjoy writers who do that.  Now I will mention this; there will be times you will have to suspend a lot of ""reality belief"" when reading this book. It's not a bad thing per se, but if you read a lot in this genre there are a few places and situations where you're like ""dude, seriously?""  BUT... this is a very fast read and the author can't cover every nuance, plus this IS a fictional story so...Reilly makes his decision and proceedes to piss off every big wig in our government while the enemy continues to launch more than a few devastating blows.  Part of the story takes place in another country and while you know the story lines will connect, you start to wonder if they'll connect.And then they do.The action taking place in the U.S. is thrilling enough, but the unrest happening across the ocean could almost be it's own story.  Man, if you think OUR politics and politicians are corrupt, call me after you read this.This book was so much fun.  Half geek, half testosterone, all action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1WFYEO2YUJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476725888#wasThisHelpful","R2T1WFYEO2YUJJ","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time I wrote this review (July 2013) I have not read one non-fiction book this year.  That's of no surprise to anyone who knows me.  I read non-fiction less than I work out.  So why this one?  Well basically, the author is a friend of mine and she asked me to.  Granted it took me a while, but again... if you know me then you know that I read according to how I feel, not when I should.  I was also apprehensive because anytime a friend asks you to read something you always wonder how they will react if you didn't like their work.  I mean let's be honest.  Authors have thinner hides than some onionskin Bibles I know.  Don't laugh, they do!  But I let her know like I let everyone know; I'll read it on my time and give you an honest critique, are you OK with that?  She was so, I did.And let me tell you, she has nothing to worry about.This is one of the shortest yet most heart breaking short story collections I've read in a long, long time.  Like I said earlier, I'm not a non-fiction reader.  I'm fiction junkie 99% of the time.  Any of the violence, cruelty, and hurt I read about I can detach myself from because I tell myself that it isn't real.Not so with non-fiction.  Even less so with this book.Matter of fact when I was reading this book I actually texted Vernica to ask her if these stories were truly real.  She said “yes"" and I said ""damn"".Every one of these stories is real and every one of these stories will touch and haunt you.  The stories focus on HIV and AIDS and how it affects the person with the disease as well as the people around them.  Vernica writes that it was an ""honor and a privilege"" to be invited into these women's lives.  I don't doubt that at all.  But it damn sure couldn't have been easy... no way it could have been easy.  These eight stories are difficult to read because of the subject matter, but they are eight stories that should be read because they are as poignant today as they were when AIDS blasted into our consciousness in the last 1970's and changed our world forever.Here are a few that really tore at me:'Ms. S' - This old lady... while her body may spill the secrets of her age, her spirit never will.  Unfortunately living free and young comes with consequences.'Tameka' - This sister was a TRIP!  Easily the most colorful character in the book… and I couldn't stand her ass!  The worst type of evil (in my opinion) is doing evil with full knowledge knowing that you're doing evil.  I read this entire story shaking my head and secretly wishing bad things would happen to Tameka.  And no, I didn't feel bad in the least bit doing so.'Vivian' - This one was shocking because of the revelation at the end of the story.'Amy' - If there is one story that stands in this collection that stands out as the most heartbreaking and raw, this one would be it.  Even now I'm having trouble putting just how... raw this story was.  It's impossible not to feel her pain and you wish so much that you could just reach in the book and take some of that pain away.'Holley' - is another story that made me upset while I was reading it.  But unlike Tameka, I was mad at Holley because she was malicious.  I was mad because Holley was just stupid.  Sorry, but she was.  Her husband Ralph wasn't any better but damn Holley... really?!  I know it's probably not fair to want to backhand this woman, but hell, she needs it.At the end of each story Vernica gives us facts and figures about HIV and AIDS as well as information in case we need to reach out to someone for help.  These facts coupled with the true stories really make you sit up and think about how AIDS has affected our neighborhood, community, and world.Vernica is very passionate about this subject and it is evident in her writing. There are a few small areas where she gets preachy (the Mona and Vivian stories for one) but I assume that's to be expected when you are around this every day.  It's always hard for first time authors to make a splash in today's book world and it's not easy. But if you're going to do it, then I suggest writing about something that is true to your soul.Vernica did.  And it shows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JG2X65WD2GDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1483404587#wasThisHelpful","R1JG2X65WD2GDC","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FINALLY.  That was my reacting after I used this speaker for a little while.  And by little while I mean every day for the past two weeks.  Finally I found a Bluetooth speaker that works, sounds good, and isn’t crap.  It’s small, very portable, and carries a good sound.  It’s not a blasting sound but it is pretty loud.My only problems with this thing are some personal trivialities.  Like what you ask?  Like this I say… what is with the FAA beckoning light on this thing?  I’ve only used this speaker at night because I enjoy going to sleep with a fan on and some type of music.  But I swear the blinking blue light they have on this speaker… the only thing missing is a 747!One awesome thing is, when I turn this speaker off I have flashbacks of Michael Winslow from ‘Police Academy’.  I wish I could upload a sound file because it’s the coolest thing to hear from a device made in 2013!  OK, back to the things that matter… it paired easily with my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro.  I would never use it with my Mac because the speakers on it sound better, but they’re supposed to.  I just wanted to see if it would work.The buttons on the side are all right.  At night however the “+” (volume up) and “-“ (volume down) are impossible to differentiate.  Also, the speaker is uniform all over which makes it hard, at night, to tell the top from bottom and if you’re turning the volume up or down.  That’s a little annoying. It also beeps, loudly, when you adjust the volume.  I hope they fix that on their next model.I haven’t given it a full battery test yet, but I did run it for two nights straight (~ 14 hours) and she still held power.  It charges via the USB port on your computer and carries a reasonable charge time. I’ve tested a few Bluetooth speakers as of late and this one is definitely a very good one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWUJLEWRDD24Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSB799G#wasThisHelpful","RWUJLEWRDD24Z","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this speaker for one reason and one reason only; to listen to as I fall asleep.  I have an iPad 4 and an iPhone 5s and while they both have decent speakers, they aren't the most convenient things to have next to you as you sleep if you want to listen to music.  So having a speaker like this would be perfect.  I could charge my devices safely across the room while still having my music play next to me.  Good idea in theory but not so much in practice.This is a good bluetooth speaker if you want to play your music at a normal to loud volume.  If you want to play it at a quiet volume then it's not good.  It has this annoying buzzing sound that is very noticeable when the sound is turned down.  This pretty much cancels it as a nighttime speaker and since this is exactly what I would use it for, it's rather disappointing.  But let me tell you about the good things as well:- It has a nice weight and for the life of me I don't know why I like that so much, but I do.  Maybe it's because it doesn't feel cheap and I like how it's not easily moved.  It has a weird rubber/plastic material on the bottom that keeps it from sliding around the table.- When you play it at regular volume the speaker does sound very good.- It paired pretty easily with my iOS devices.  It does come with a cord that you can plug your laptop into it, but unless you're using a Dell (hehehehe) your speakers will sound better.  The cord also charges the speaker via USB.- You can control the volume, forward, play, and pause all from the buttons on the speaker.- Very portable.The not so good:- Low volume sound is not good.- I found that the 10 meter working distance is a little exaggerated.  There were times where I was in the same room and caught distortion and crackling.  When I tested the distance I was surprised to see how little I had to walk before the sound cut out completely.- That flashing blue and red indicator light... that dance club called, they want their strobe lights back.Not a bad speaker but there is room for improvement.  I tested this speaker using an iPad 4, iPhone 5s, and a Compaq laptop.  The music sites I used were Rhapsody and iTunes and iTunes Radio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZRVBUJ0FORXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTE0U5K#wasThisHelpful","RZRVBUJ0FORXW","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So it took me a while to get to this book because every time I went to pick it up, another book would edge it's way into my queue.  I hate that I waited so long but it wasn't my fault.  I'm very happy to hear that Easy is ""back"".  I never thought he was gone to begin with.  If you read Mosley you'll slowly understand the way he phrases his stories.  The ending of 'Blonde Faith' leads you to believe one thing, while hoping for another.  This book is the realization of that hope.It doesn't take you long to get back into the world of Easy and it makes you feel as if Walter never really had plans to get rid of Easy in the first place.  Especially since, at a book signing, he said that he's already completed the NEXT Easy book.  Fans of this series will no doubt be pleased at the resurgence of their everyday hero.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60MM0TW0VNXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535988#wasThisHelpful","R60MM0TW0VNXB","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twelve books in and Simon is still writing like he has something to prove.  After a bit of a Macro/Cato hiatus, Simon takes us back to the Roman legion with all the action and blood that we have grown to love.  And expect.  But this story had a weird... feel to it.  I read this book so pissed at Cato that I was actually rooting against him.After having themselves soiled with having to do the bidding of Narcissus, Centurion Macro and Prefect Cato are finally able to do some ""decent soldiering"".  Unfortunately it's on the dreadful island of Britannia with all of the charm and luxury that she affords.  Caratacus is still harassing the Empire and the Emperor needs to put him down.  You know... especially since the Emperor stated ""mission accomplished"" a few years back.Caratacus and his band of barbarians are as brutal a group as Rome has fought.  Death on the battlefield is seen by most ancient tribes as the honorable way for a warrior to die.  However, if you're fighting Caratacus and happen to live through it, death might be seen as deliverance.  But despite the brutality of the barbarians, it pales in comparison to our new king of the ball, Centurion Quertus.  This is where my contemptuous for Cato begins and also where this exciting story starts to get even better.Quertus is a soldier who takes immense pleasure in breaking the locals.  And by breaking I mean abject slaughter.  The twist here is that he's not entirely out of line with his orders, just his methods.  And he should probably take a remedial course on 'How to Treat Superiors 101'.  Prefect Cato has been ordered to take command of the fort and he finds he must fight the enemy as well as rogue Romans.Simon has written antagonist in his books before, but few have made me hate them the way Quertus did. I hated him with such fervor that I started to hate Cato for being... well... Cato.  Macro on the other hand was exactly what you would expect.  Matter of fact, near the end of this book he is put in a situation and well... shocking and brutal is all I can say.  I loved it!Through all the pain, broken bones, and spilt blood Simon still manages to show us the glory of Rome.  As I mentioned earlier, this is the twelfth book in the series and it's as strong as the rest of them.  Good can only shine if there is darkness.  With Caratacus roasting Roman soldiers on the outside and Centurian Quertus being an insubordinate ass on the inside, Cato and Macro are stuck in it.  Bad for our legionaries, good for us readers.  Simon Scarrow is a definite leader in the increasingly crowded field of Roman historical-fiction.  Books like this continue to prove that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GPEIXO7Q3QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKHO3C0#wasThisHelpful","R17GPEIXO7Q3QP","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beginning of 'A Time to Kill' opens with one of the cruelest act that could ever be committed on a fellow human being.  That scene will forever be seared in the minds of anyone who has read it.The ending of 'Sycamore Row' will evoke that exact same emotion.I digress but let me quickly throw this in since I'll get this question five thousand times a day until Christmas.  ""Is this book really a sequel to 'A Time to Kill'?  It depends on what your definition of ""sequel"" is.  If to you a sequel is a book that includes the same characters as the previous book, then yes.  If to you a sequel is a book that continues on the same storyline as the previous book, then no.  There are references to Carl Lee and ""that verdict"" but not enough (in my opinion) to call it a continuation of the storyline in 'A Time to Kill'.I know that's splitting hairs and to be honest... it really doesn't matter.'Sycamore Row' is a GRAND SLAM in the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, last game of the Series, off a pitcher that, up to that point, has thrown a perfect game.  If you think I'm exaggerating I would love to chat with you after you've read this book.  Seriously.  I'm an unapologetic fan of Grisham and while I think he is a magnificent writer, I'm under no illusion that everything he writes is gold.  (*Ahem*, 'The Last Juror', 'The Racketeer').  But there are the gold ones like 'The Broker', 'The Confession', 'A Time To Kill'...And now 'Sycamore Row'.This story centers around a colorful old man named of Seth Hubbard.  Seth is old.  Seth is dying.  Seth is rich. Unfortunately the rich part is the one that draws the attention of everyone.  Even if said rich is only speculative, and not yet proven.  Seth is a shrewd yet successful business man with a plan that, on the surface, looks like he's lost his damn mind. He kills himself, leaves behind a new will that cuts out his children and bequeaths 90% of his estate to the Black maid.A white man in the Deep South leaving the bulk of his rumored riches to his Black hired help... yeah, can't see why that would be a problem.  Although the will is explicit in its direction and clear in its execution, you know it'll be challenged. Why?  Because there hasn't yet been a law written that is above the scrutiny of the mighty and great wisdom of the all-knowing attorney.  And so begins the circus.We do have the pleasure of witnessing the antics of Harry Rex and beloved Lucien once again. These guys. I swear, there isn't enough alcohol in Ireland to sate those two. Despite their quest to become the reincarnation of 'Bartles & James', Ford County would be one hell of a boring place without them. And Jake would be lost.Ah yes Jake.  Life hasn't gone exactly as our brave lawyer hoped.  Of course he did try a double murder case for only $900, so I'm not sure what he expected from good ole' Ford County.  He's brought into this battle courtesy a mailed letter from Mr. Hubbard himself.  Now contesting a will does seem dull and boring, and I'm sure in real life it is.  But in the hands of John Grisham, following all this mess is pure joy.Lettie Lang is the Black housekeeper who is the heir to this (potential) windfall.  And because of such the leeches and distant family have all shown up to ""help her through this rough and difficult time"".  Not only that, but she doesn't heed the advice of Jake and surrounds herself with one of the most jerk-off character I've had the pleasure of reading in a Grisham novel.  I'll only say he's a lawyer from Memphis, TN and I was literally laughing out loud at this clown.  Think of it like this... what if Al Sharpton had an entourage?A good writer tells you about the interaction between characters.  A great writer makes you feel the interaction between the characters.  I wasn't sure if I liked Judge Atlee or not.  At times I was cheering, other times I was found myself using words that I specifically invented for that lawyer clown from Memphis.  I wanted to hug Dell and ask her if she's make me some shrimp-n-grits while bumping that ample derriere against me.  My respect for Sheriff Ozzie grew and my distain for Seth's ""family"" only grew.  And by ""grew"" I mean ""like cancer"".The last time I felt such hatred and bile for a person(s) was Travis Boyette in 'The Confession'.  And unless your father's name is Lucifer, you will too.  Remember how I said a great writer will make you feel the interaction between the characters?  With the loathing I had for this family, I felt that interaction between those characters and ME!  His offspring are probably the only people who could make a suicide (by hanging no less) feel like a bloody escape.Now... I'm going to warn you that there are two parts in this book that will make you pause.  (Don't worry no spoilers here.).  The first is an incident that involves Lattie Lang's husband.  The father of the family he affects comes to speak to Jake and that conversation... if your eyes don't get a little bit wet then you have a heart of pure concrete.The second part I alluded to earlier is the ending.  'A Time to Kill' has one of the most disturbing openings you'll read.  'Sycamore Row' has one of the most disturbing endings.  The more you read the faster your heart beats. And the faster your heart beats the more you read.  As you read this book you wonder ""what does this have to do with that?"", ""what is the significance of that?""  And then it hits you... right in the gut.Hard.'Sycamore Row' is history.  'Sycamore Row' is symbolic. 'Sycamore Row' is a place of pain.  'Sycamore Row' is a place of beauty. 'Sycamore Row' is one of the best books I've read this year.*Personal note: John Grisham has had a few give-a-ways and contests with this new book of his.  I entered but I didn't win.  (No surprise there if you're familiar with my luck)  You know what I wish John would do?  I wish he would have a contest and then the winner(s) of the contest get to come to his house, sit on the porch, drink sweet (very sweet) iced tea, snack on boiled peanuts, and just listen to John tell stories.  I've said this before but John has that old school, old soul, old traditional Southern way of telling stories.  And it translates perfectly to paper.Google Hangouts and FB question and answer sessions are great ways to connect us with our favorite writers.  But imagine... just imagine a weekend in Mississippi immersed in the Southern culture, shooting the breeze on a slow Saturday afternoon with one of the most engaging storytellers writing today.  THAT would be something.  OK enough mindless meanderings from a book lover, back to your regularly scheduled life.

"Boyd Morrison's first book was `The Ark'.  It was about the secret behind Noah's Ark and the flood, but his take on the flood is very different, very interesting, yet very plausible.  His second book, `The Vault', was a thriller about King Midas and his legendary ""touch"".  The next one, `The Roswell Conspiracy', was about Roswell/Area 51 and interspersed between the Tyler Locke adventures we get `Rogue Wave', a book about a comet striking the planet and ghetto slapping Hawaii and `The Catalyst', a book about science, technology, and the artificial making of diamonds.  Yeah.So as you can tell Boyd has a pretty healthy track record of writing books about the fantastic.  GOOD books mind you, but truly fantastic.  So I shouldn't have been at all surprised to see that his new book `The Loch Ness Legacy' is about out dear girl `Nessie', the mythical Loch Ness monster... all... right... I'll bite.  Actually this was an easy call for me because I've read all of Boyd's book (less `Roswell') and I have enjoyed them all.  But this one... even for Boyd it seemed like a stretch.Tyler, our brilliant ass kicking scientist/soldier is back in his fourth adventure and he's (again) rushing against the clock to save the world.  This time it's to track down this creature, that they aren't sure exists, in order to help staunch a weapon that was created by the Nazi's from starting World War 3.  A mythological creature, Nazi's, modern day terrorists, biological weapons... what the hell!?!  But that's Boyd for ya'.The crazy man (because there's always a crazy man) behind all this mayhem is Carl Zim.  A white supremacist with (who would have guessed) a very imbecilic view on who should populate this world.  He and his loyal numbskulls attack the Eiffel Tower and that is where this maze starts.  But this time it's extremely personal because Boyd's sister is forced in the fray and his best buddy Grant is caught with something VERY bad.`The Loch Ness Legacy' is another world traveling thriller that takes us from the fish tossing markets of Seattle, to Versailles France, to the highlands of Scotland, and to the depths of Loch Ness herself.  There are bad guys, hot women, cool weapons, and enough action to choke a unicorn.  No, unicorns don't make an appearance in this book but you never know with Boyd.One of the best parts in this book for me?  That submarine.  I would LOVE to troll the depths in something like that.  Not sure if I want to look out and see the murky peat of Loch Ness, but a trip to the Marianna Trench or even around the islands of the Bahamas.  Yeah... I could get with that.  (Anytime you want to send that invitation Boyd...)As usual I had fun reading Boyd's book because they are fun reads.  And get this... I even understood some of the crazy science and cryptozoology terms!  I guess you DO get smarter by reading.  Thanks Boyd for giving us another one to savor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OBYEJQZCMVVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484966341#wasThisHelpful","R2OBYEJQZCMVVS","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honor.  Love.  Loyalty.  Sex.  Death.  Usually that would be a tag line for one of my Roman books.  This time I'm talking about one of Harlem's most talented writers, K'wan.  To me authors are celebrities and it's an unwritten rule that once you've ""made it"" as a celebrity you only need one name.  Jordan, Beyonce', Montana, Ah-nold... you get the idea.  K'wan is one of my celebrity authors who are like that.When an author puts out a book we rejoice.  When they put out an eBook between the yearly releases, it's like extra caramel on... well... just about anything.  This time out the eBook is `Purple Reign'.  Chapter 1 opens this story with every man's dream (if you have to ask then you might wanna get your testosterone level checked) and it doesn't slow down.We head to Miami, and Miami is the place where you can get it ALL in your face!  The saying is ""revenge is a dish best served cold"".  Apparently it should also be served naked.  Violence is a distance cousin of lust and lust is the horny uncle we all have and try to ignore.  Don B, Lord Scientific, and other brothers that have had their rep forged in concrete, prove that they are no stronger than the regular man when it comes to women.What's shocking is the manner in which it happens.One of the great joys I have as a reader is reading authors who write to the point of no return, past the point of no return, and then pimp slap the point of no return with pimp hand so hard you're left wondering if they really meant to write that.  Well K'wan did and... damn!`Purple Reign' is a shorter version of what K'wan does best.  Tell stories.  And the brotha' does it well.  Very, very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFF56AP83HKZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9HG86U#wasThisHelpful","RFF56AP83HKZA","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow.  Where do I start?  It's been just shy of two years since Steve Alten has released a book, but if 'Omega Project' is the end result of two years of research and work, then I sincerely hope he takes another two years before he puts his next one out.GEEZ-US this was a good book!  And a surprisingly short one for Alten.  'Shell Game' came in at 534 pages, 'Grim Reaper' at 672, and 'Meg: Hell's Aquarium at 512.  This one is only 329.  I wondered how Steve was going to fit this mammoth of a story into only 300+ pages but he did.  And he did it by not putting in any fluff.  Every word matters and every sentence holds meaning.  None of that trick that we all did in high school.  You know the one, adding a few extra ""very"" and ""and"" to add to increase our word count.  Steve doesn't have any useless embellishment, no wasteful back-story.Everything that went in mattered.'Omega Project' is the type of novel my dreams are based on.  It takes place in the past, it takes place in the future, and it takes place in the ummm... super future.  One of my dreams has always been to go back in time and see Mother Earth before man screwed her up.  And I mean waaayyyy back when dinosaurs roamed, when the Amazon was beautiful, lush and deadly, and the only thing more pure than a mountain stream was another mountain stream.  Oh how I dream.  My other dream (nightmare) is that I would love to see the end of the world.  Morbid, I know and I fully embrace that.  But I love reading end of the world novels and this one is a big fat juicy bite of that.This story opens with what we've grown used to... mankind being lied to about an extremely dire situation.  The next chapter is the residue of that ignorance.  And thus begins our story...Our planet has gone through one hell of a change.  One so radical that even Noah would say ""No way"".  Our main boy, Ike, has been selected for a mission that would greatly increase mankind's chance for survival.  Oh yeah, he also created GOLEM.  What is a GOLEM you say?  Think of a supercomputer on ""X"".  Now multiply that by about a thousand, add a few strands of DNA, the ability to learn before things happen, and a severe God complex.  THAT'S GOLEM.Ike's mission is simple; secretly evaluate the crew on a practice run to make sure that they are the right people chosen to make the real trip to Jupiter to mine for helium-3.  There are twelve of them, six men, six women, and (oh yeah) Ike.  Of course this is a Steve Alten novel so NOTHING goes as it should.  Absolutely nothing.I mentioned earlier that Steve doesn't waste words with this book.  That is appreciated even more with the interacting between the characters.  There is (sorry if this sounds cheesy) character magic with these people.  The emotion, the banter, the sexual tension, the intellect, even the conflict worked to propel this story into something extraordinary.  So something happens on this mission and our boy Ike is thrust into a world that I have only dreamed about.  And I suppose him as well.  But while my dream world is full of nature in all its beauty and majesty, Ike's real world is anything but.Nature has... evolved.But not into unicorns and sparkling ponies.  No, she's evolved into something frighteningly scary, and Ike has about two minutes to figure this out or she'll make him into history.  This is where this story REALLY gets good.  Remember GOLEM?  Well he (she/it) plays a very interesting roll in the creation of this new world.  All of Steve's books make you question your beliefs and this one is no different.  Without giving away any spoilers you wonder what God is, who God is, and how far would he allow things to go before stepping in.  Or would he step in at all?  You also wonder will mankind learn anything from our past.But it's weird... even after two pages I don't feel that I've done a good job telling you what this book is about.  I've left out so many things that make this such a wonderful read.  I didn't tell you about ABE, good lord how could I not tell you about ABE?  I didn't tell you about all the exceedingly smart and extremely good looking and pre-nymph women, I didn't tell you about the mind-bending technology, some pretty cool ""Easter eggs"" which I rather enjoyed, the science, and the granddaddy of them all... the story.Steve is a writer and this man can tell a damn story.  I know I sound like a broken record because every time I read one of Steve's stories I say that.  But I can't help it.  Talking about one of Steve's books and leaving out how great the storyline is like telling a blind man that Paula Patton is standing naked in front of him.  What good is it if you keep it to yourself?Ok back to the things I forgot to tell you about; (did I mention the women?)... I think... oh yeah one more... Steve alluded to this twist in the book trailer but I almost wish he hadn't because I think it's a bit of a spoiler.  Not a large one but I admit to thinking ""what the hell"" when I watched it.As per classic Steve this book plows through and you don't know how the hell things will turn out until the very last page.  And I sincerely mean the very. last.  page.  This is an apocalyptic thriller with heavy emphasis on the `apocalyptic' and `thriller'.  There are a few veiled (not really) political jabs thrown in because that's just how Steve is, as well as humor in just the right places.  There are majestic creatures, scary creatures, and creatures that are like us.And madness.But it's not a madness that you can, nor will you want, to escape.  So don't.  Don't even bother trying.  Providing I'm blessed to live a long life, I have already started a ""re-read"" list.  Steve is already on there with `Grim Reaper' and `Meg'.  Now I have one more to add.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9ZZWJF2FIGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765336324#wasThisHelpful","RV9ZZWJF2FIGR","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this title made me laugh.  If you're a child of the 90's you can't help but think of Sir-Mix-A-Lot!  However, as weird as it may sound, both Sir-Mix-A-Lot and Rachel Kramer Bussel do share one thing in common.  They both love a well shaped booty!  Hell if you want to be honest, who doesn't?  But while Sir Mix is all out how booty looks, Rachel and her sexual minions are all about how booty feels.  So prepare for a ride on the dark... I mean the backside.I don't suppose that anyone who has a problem reading this type of stuff would even be reading this review or checking out this book.  But just in case, know this collection of erotic short stories covers every freaky lifestyle imaginable.  (OK, maybe not imaginable but the range is still pretty great).  Despite the slowly progressive nature of our society, booty sex is still a major taboo.  I guess that's what makes collections such as these, fun.We're voyeurs on something that we either can't do or won't do.  Something so decadent and so naughty that we'd rather buy the eBook than the paperback, so that no one can see us reading it.  What would you did (god forbid) if you were caught in the `New York Underground Public Library' reading this book?  I will say that even for folks (like me) who are OK with different types of sexual situations and techniques; there were a few short stories in here that made me go ""huh?""  Not in a bad way but rather in a ""OK I need to go back and reread that because I thought she was... no wait, I thought HE was... no wait... hold on... "" kind of way.Rachel and her harem of writers deliver yet again.  Here are a few of my favorites:`Brenda's Booty' by Tenille Brown.  THIS is how you open a collection like this one!

"Everything has lead up to this.  The blood baths in the arena, the relentless treachery of the lubricous talking Greeks, the unrepentant training regiments, and the exhausting emotional strain all come to a head in `Arena: Champion'.Pavo finally gets to fight Hermes to avenge his father's death, but it doesn't go at all like you (or I imagined).

Yeah... there were certain names that I called him that I couldn't say here and that would probably be banned even in a sailor's dictionary.Of course, if you saw the concrete-man that Hermes was, if you saw what he did to a fellow gladiator during a practice session, then if you were on the wrong end of a marketplace brawl, you might say a few curses as well.  While I was eager to see Pavo vs. Hermes, I was also eager to see if the wretched Greeks would get their come uppins'.I of course won't tell you how things turn out, but you can trust that just because this is the last eBook in this series, the action, nor treachery slows down.  It's been one heck of a ride and even though we knew a ""real"" book was going to come out that combined all of these, it was still nice to have something to look forward to reading every two months.Now... I'm ready for his next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PHJU690Z75V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ABLJ50E#wasThisHelpful","R37PHJU690Z75V","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another book that ""slipped"" by me.  What's that make... three this year?  Either I need to start paying better attention to my authors or they need to send me a personal invitation when their next book comes out.  A post-it note on a $100 bill pasted under the windshield wiper of a new Jeep Rubicon will do.  In case... you know... you ever get that itch.Mark Gimenez, Mark Gimenez, Mark Gimenez.  Say his name three times while looking into a mirror and his books will magically appear on your bookshelf.  I recommend Mark to all of my book reading friends as well as other authors because his books read like he's sitting next to you while you're in bed reading you a night time story.  (Sorry if that's a little creepy but I trust you understand what I mean).This time out Mark takes us to the sprawling metropolis of Marfa, TX. Never heard of this place until this book but it's certainly a place I want to visit now.  I read this story as an eBook so it was easy to switch between the story and Google Maps to view the concrete boxes as well as the other small towns mentioned.  Trust me... you'll want to do the same.While Marfa, TX is the setting in which the store revolves the character that adds personality is a guy by the name of John Bookman, or `Book' for short.  Book teaches constitutional law and is a lawyer with a unique gift.  Every once in a while he takes a case that is a lost cause and does what he can.  One of these lost causes takes him and his intern to west Texas.  It takes a bold writer to combine oil, gas, fracking, minimalist art, New York City, roughnecks, Moonpies, a Harley, and concrete.  But Mark does and somehow... it works.Book, along with his very attractive intern (insert joke here) has been summoned to Marfa, TX because of a former intern and the accusations he levels on his employer.  However, this is Texas, and Texas means big oil, big gas, big egos and BIG money.  You mess with any of that and you're looking for a big ass whoopin.  This story has the usual ""Gimenez Touch""; funny one-liners, wonderful dialogue between the characters, and a healthy dose of the law.  There was one rare slow part in this book however.  When Mark was explaining `fracking.'  OMG!!  I thought I had fallen into the Twilight Zone.  I understand the reasoning for it but... DAMN!  I felt like Nadine there for a few seconds.  It happens only a few times, and once you get through it you're off and running again.I'm also happy to see that this will be a series.  I'd imagine there are a million and one stories involving Book, the grand state of Texas, and the revolving door of interns.  Yeah... them.  I was a little put off that Book kept telling so many ""no"".  What's up with that?  Smart, famous, accomplished, handsome, surrounded by Texas senoritas?! ... dude... use what you got!!!Ah well... the musings of a reader.  Another job well done Mark.  Another job well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGMHB75TO1QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSCZCPU#wasThisHelpful","R3JGMHB75TO1QP","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, here's a joke:  what's the difference between a July day in Aiken, SC, hell, a five-alarm fire, and a Zane anthology?  The answer: not one damn thang!  Zane brings us twenty-five (twenty-six including hers) short stories of sweaty, sticky, undulating, uninhibited sex.  The eroticism of their written words is surpassed only by the images they inspire.  These short stories are nothing of the sort because you'll need to factor in day-dreaming time and... stress releasing time. (Oh hush, you freaks know what I mean.)Here are some of my favorites:'Doing Bris' by R.W. Shannon - great opening (no jokes here please) to this collection and this short story had nothing to do with the dude being named Jason.'Prime Piece of Property' by Nadia - selling houses should always be this fun.'After Dark' by Niyah Moore - this was a good short story, but it didn't make my list because of the story. It made my list because of the last paragraph and one sentence.  I NEVER saw that coming, but when I went back and reread the story I saw the subtle clues and hints. I like how writers can do that. They cause you to miss something on the first pass but on the second or third read you're like ""oh... damn...""  Good one Niyah.'So Much for Rules' by W. Biddle Street - The girl in this one had me cracking up!!  I enjoy when an author can blend sex and humor.'Hard Times' by Lynn Lake - my absolute FAVORITE story in this collection.  Let me say that again, my. absolute. favorite. story. in. this. collection. Wanton, lusty, naughty, pick one. You could literally feel the need and experience the shiver of release from these two.  Somebody find Lynn Lake for me and buy her (?) a beer.'Dirty' by Carla S. Pennington - another funny sexy one. Especially the comment about the Magnum condom.'Shadow Dancer' by Landon Dixon - all I can say about this one is ""be careful what you wish for"".'Intimate Strangers' by Michelle Janine Robinson - if the mile-high club was an actual club, these two would be the founding members.'Coosawhatchie' by Zane - As usual Zane closes out her collection of literary hedonism with one of her own. I was happy to see that she represented my home state of South Carolina, but damned if I knew where Coosawhatchie is. And yes, it is a town because Goole Maps said so.  The story; country girl meets city orgasm. I will always remember my first experience with a Zane book. It was 'Nervous', and I was browsing the table, saw the cover, picked it up, read a few chapters, and burst out laughing right there in the bookstore. I'm glad to see that magic is still there.We always hear about the hot summer movie but never about the hot summer book.Consider that oversight corrected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JI6092V3D964/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451689640#wasThisHelpful","R3JI6092V3D964","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About two weeks in my bookstore I was telling a friend that it takes me, on average, about three to four days to finish a book.  This one took me a day and a half.  Why?  The answer is obvious; this book was good.  No wait, this book was `Good Times' good.  And by `Good Times good' I mean it was ""damn... damn... damn!"" good.  This one also had the flavor of `The Last Patriot'.  Harvath is still front and center but he's doing more tracking down and investigating than killing.  That's OK because others have taken up his slack and wow... does Brad really get brutal.This story has a few major story lines going on and (at least to me) more characters than usual.  So while you're up at 2 AM reading this book make sure you pay attention to who is who because the person on page 150 might not be the person on page 152.  Brad has never been one to shirk from taking the truth, mudstomping it, and then throwing it in our face.  `Hidden Order' is no different and this time the Federal Reserve is the one on the Brad Thor guillotine.I've always been of the mind that fiction authors write to entertain and non-fiction authors write to educate.  Brad (and a few others) the enviable insane skill to accomplish both.  I consider myself pretty educated but I had no clue about some of the Federal Reserve facts and even some of the facts about Boston, MA.  I probably could have finished this book in a day if I didn't stop to Google fact check.  But it's literally impossible not to because you would think that our government... OUR flippin' government isn't that blind (stupid) or nave to not see what we see.  But they are.  And someone has taken upon themselves to exploit it.As I alluded to earlier, Scot is wearing the uniform of an investigator vs. his usual two taps to the skull get up that I like seeing him wearing in this book because some really bad people are doing some REALLY bad things.  I know, I know... they are always doing bad things.  But there is something really... sinister about these guys and in the manner in which they dispatch their victims.  Terror, abject fear, and unimaginable pain don't even come close to describing it.In between the history lesson about the Federal Reserve and beloved Boston there is a lot of action and a very interesting story line between Harvath and another character.  I say interesting because this interaction could have some deeper ramifications as this series moves on.  I like how Brad has developed Harvath over the years and grown him as well.  I seriously don't think a twenty-five year old Harvath would have done what the forty-year old Harvath did.Anyway, Brad can tell a story like nobody's business and you no choice but to enjoy the conflict between the alpha males, Harvath and Cordero.  You'll wonder how you could admire (too strong a word?) the genius and creativity of the killers while you are given a history lesson you would NEVER learn in today's schools, all while apprehensively turning the pages because you really don't want to see how they slaughter the next person.  But you can't help it.  This type of voyeurism goes way beyond craning your neck to see an accident.  This is craning your neck to see an accident all while crossing your fingers that there is another one around the corner.Brad Thor never disappoints and this one is another bullet!  On a personal note; I had the honor of meeting Brad Thor at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library last year.  I also had the honor of getting to ask him a question during the lecture.  My question was ""You use a lot of high tech weapons/technology in your books, do you in real life""?  His answer was ""yes"".  Keeping that answer in mind I was blown away to read about the Aerion Supersonic Business Jet.  You know he's flown on that baby... you know he has!  Brad... dude... I wanna be you when I grow up!  And Natalie... oh mama!  Of course Natalie would just be pure eye candy lest Mrs. Thor kicks Brad's ass and Mrs. Frost kicks mine.`Hidden Order'.  5 stars, 13 stripes, red white and blue through and through!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLC6UGLWHSCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717095#wasThisHelpful","RJLC6UGLWHSCU","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one of those books that grabbed me because of the cover.  I Picked it up, read the back, and immediately put it on my ""to read"" list.  For me, choosing a historical-fiction biblical novel is tricky.  I've read some that were very good and some... not so much.  But my reading mojo called to me to read this book, so I did.You know going in that liberties will be taken because this is a novel, the fun part is finding out where.  I will say that I did go back and reread the Biblical (NIV) story of Noah after I read this book to 1. Refresh my memory and 2. To see which liberties were taken.Did I enjoy this book?  Yes.  I liked how Rebecca told the story of Noah.  She took the Biblical story, mixed in her own story, and filled in the ""holes"".  While the story mainly revolved Noah and his wife I must admit that I was very taken (and revolted) by Javan.  She was as horrible and disgusting as she was intriguing.  Given the fact that we knew how wicked the world was at that time, I wouldn't be surprised if God chose to end the world based on what she did on say... Wednesday.  When your evil stands out in a world of evil... your tail is evil!!Rebecca takes us on a journey from before the flood, during the flood, after the flood, and after the water recedes.  The part where this story slowed down for me was when they were on the ark.  The brothers Ham, Shem, and Japheth have some very serious conflicts, some of which made me wonder if the flood might have missed a few people.  This is but one of the places where purists will have a problem with the creative liberties taken.  Especially when it comes to the brother's wives, wow.  Unfortunately, this was the only highlight to their time spent on the ark.  At least for me.The ending was very interesting.  (No spoilers).  A couple of things happened that made me ""this didn't happen in the Bible... did it""?  I went back and reread Genesis and it did indeed not happen.  But what an interesting imagination Rebecca had to write it in the direction it went.  I haven't looked hard enough to see if there will be a sequel but there very easily could be because this story ended quite abruptly.  Actually... yeah it did end pretty ""BAM""!!  But there was a weird resolution to one very big part of this story.All in all I was very pleased with this debut novel from Rebecca Kanner, and I look forward to more of her work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TBXQBWEJDN8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451695233#wasThisHelpful","R1TBXQBWEJDN8L","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now THIS was a fun Allison Hobbs book!  Plenty of searing sex, twisted situations that border between illegal and uncomfortable, and a interesting story line.  That idiotic Amazon write-up doesn't do this book justice at all.  When you read this book you'll be taken by the back-story that Allison has woven in here and THAT is the true meat to this tale.Fonia, as a little girl, witnesses her mom carry on a relationship with a man named Mr. Lord.  Mr. Lord loves to control women and Mr. Lord loves to control little girls.  He controls women with sex, and he controls little girls with manipulation.  The crazy part is these little girls have to grow up... and they grow up with this devil.  A few years ago there were a ton of jokes about that sick-o Woody Allen marrying his adopted daughter because he was pretty much just growing pussy in his house.  That's kinda how I felt about Mr. Lord.But let's back up a bit... this book starts out crazy hot!  Brother in shower, hotel room, horny maid, you do the math.  Allison wastes no time grabbing your attention and you'll waste no time grabbing... um... other things.  Jaguar is a playboy and really enjoys the company of women.  They, in turn, enjoy his.  His sexual exploits alone make this book worthwhile but what would be the fun if we didn't read about the women?  They love him and his magic stick and are more than willing to give me anything he wants anywhere he wants.  (Some guys have all the luck).Getting back to Fonia; she is a woman who, buy no fault of her own, has the self esteem of one-legged bald-headed woman with sharp teeth and one eye.  Her life isn't her and she has her mother and Mr. Lord to thank for that.  Over the years things happen that mold Fonia into something else.  And as crazy as this may sounds, I really enjoyed reading about the ""other Fonia"". The ""other"" Fonia is someone I wish I could meet while I'm washing my Jeep or making a buffalo wing run.So you have Jaguar and you have Fonia... two sexual souls on a collision course that, when met, might end up with both of them in traction.  One problem: Mr. Lord.OK, this guy!  I stated before that he's the devil and I meant that.  He does things to Fonia and her mother that will make you feel naughty and immoral just for reading it.  The Bible says ""raise a child in the way he should go and they will not depart from it"".  You got THAT right!  That verse must be Fonia's mantra because... damn.  However, I don't think God meant for the verse to be used like this.  Witnessing Fonia exploring her sexuality is a tantalizing as Meagan Good wearing... well... just about anything.  Fiona goes through a few transformations in this story. Some you feel sorry for and some you dream for.I really enjoyed this book by Allison and it reminded me of the fun I had during her 'Insatiable' and'Double Dipping' days. She's my girl, she's my friend, and she's one of my favorite authors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQJM9XG21NXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593094183#wasThisHelpful","ROQJM9XG21NXT","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well... where do I begin?  Richard Jeanty sent me this book a few months ago but, like most readers, I have to be in a certain mood to read certain books. What kind of mood must you be in to read a book like this?  A real good one. If by some chance you aren't in a good mood, by the time you finish this book you will be. This is part three of a series but I don't think you need to go back and read the other two in order to catch up. This one stands on its own, only the characters are the same. `Sexual Exploits of a Nympho 1' came out in 2005, so it's been eight years from #1 to #3. I still think you should read the first one because that one is crazy-stoopid hot! (Shut up, I'm a child of the 90's).Darren and Tina have tied the knot and are working hard to make their dream come true. New businesses, new clients, new money, and a new assistant. The new assistant is where the problem comes. Think of your dream woman. Now think of your dream woman wearing something sexy (very sexy). Now think of your dream woman wearing something sexy and working next to you. Everyday. Sometime up to ten hours a day. The dream girl is Abigail and the HNIC is Darren. You know where this is going to go, what you don't know is the how/when/and where.But you find out. In graphic, glory, sensual, erotic detail.Over the years I have known Richard to be a writer who holds back absolutely nothing when it comes to writing his sex scenes. That doesn't change with this book. Darren and Tina are in wedding bliss and their bedroom life is chock full of fun, sweating, moaning, groaning, spanking, and thanking. You'd think that when you have someone who is attentive to each and every one of your sexual desires you wouldn't need to cheat.Well... you'd  be wrong.Although Darren and Tina are happy with each other, they have appetites for other things. I liken this to a man who loves buffalo wings.  Despite his love for buffalo wings, one day he has an uncontrollable for steamed shrimp.  No matter how many flavors of buffalo wings you put in front of him, nor how good they are, it doesn't matter because he wants shrimp. Darren is the man, Tina is the buffalo wing, and Abigail is the shrimp. One fine brick-house of a shrimp.The only hiccup was during the sexual assault trial. The build up was great and I was already to get into a nasty court battle... then ""that"" happens. That left a bad taste in my mouth because I was sincerely like ""huh... wait... that can't be how it turns out can it?""  I mean it was really weird because I almost feel like that part could have been left out and the story would have been just fine.If you know Richard or follow him on FaceBook then you know how outspoken he is on a number of issues.  Some authors beat you over the head with it and don't have the first damn clue how to tactfully work it into a story.  Richard does.  There's a fine line between preaching and having conviction.  I don't agree with Richard all of the time but I can appreciate how he works it in.  I think that is also the reason I'm so miffed by the courtroom trial.  I was waiting and wanting the judge and the defense to publically prison rape that racist prosecutor... but... ah well.All in all I enjoyed (yet again) another book by Mr. Jeanty.

"'The Forgotten Legion'. Published in 2009 (US). Read in 2013.I've read most of Ben Kane's books and have enjoyed each of them. My bookstore has carried 'Forgotten Legion' for a while now, and I've even sold it a number of times based on the strength of his other books. But I haven't read it until now. Please don't be like me. Read this book. Read this book now.If you enjoy historical-fictional stories with Rome as the backdrop, then this should be your next book. Yes it has your to be expected showering of blood, guts, and abject brutality. But what keeps your face buried in these pages are the way he tells you about the blood, guts, and abject brutality. This book is easily one of the books that you will hate to put down. I had more than a few 2 AM nights reading this puppy.Rome is in a precarious state. Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus all want power and each has a ""legitimate"" claim to the throne, per say. There is a lot of story going on here with a few very interesting ""I'm taking literary creativity with a few things and if you don't like it you can suck it out a straw"" twists. Julius Caesar... every writer has fun writing about this guy and Ben is no exception.  But in this case Caesar is not a nice guy.  Ben writes him as an ambitious man but an ambitious man that has a very dark side.  A very dark side.They saying goes, ""control the mob and you control Rome"".  So while Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus are busy playing `Stratego', the real story is found in the gutter.  The smelly, putrid, disgusting, fetid smelling gutter.  Slaves, legionaries, prostitutes, thieves and murderers all play their part in this very exciting Roman tale.Romulus and Fabiola are brother and sister.  Both are born into slavery and both have suffered enough pain and seen enough cruelty to make Caligula say ""damn"".  Despite their lowly stature as slaves the gods still see fit to play Tiddlywinks with their lives and that is the meat of the story.  From the gladiator arena, to the brothel, to the battlefield, to Gaul, to lands never seen by Roman eyes, Ben takes us on one hell of a story during one hell of a time.I am deliberately not reading the books in this series (there are three total) back to back to back because I really want to savor the way this man tells a story.  And I want it to last for more than a few days.  Yeah... this book WAS that good and based on his other works, I have no reason not to believe the others won't be the same.  Oh... one more thing.  `The Forgotten Legion' is an interesting title.  Interesting because, well I don't want to say anything and spoil it for you.

"You know that feeling you get when you're reading and the characters are in the midst of something so... horrible that you think it can't possibly get worse?  But then it does?  That's this right here.  `Arena: Revenge' is the fourth book in Simon Scarrow's eBook series that just gets better with each release.  #4 picks up right where #3 ended, with Macro and Pavo about to do the tango with a host of wild animals in the arena.  OK, not necessarily a host... but they will have to face one EXTREMELY ticked off and hungry lion.  Their blood is but the first of gallons to be spent on the arena floor.Their trek to this point has been one brutal pain soaked brawl after another.  The gods must have been in a drunken rage when they were putting together this part of Pavo and Macro's timeline because... damn.  The searing brutality of the arena is on full display here as well as the twists that Simon throws in because 1. He wants to make sure you're paying attention and 2. He can do that because the man knows how to tell a damn story.  Matter of fact he slips in one juicy morsel and creates one hell of a ""Nooooo, is he serious!?"" moment.Setting aside for a second Pavo's life as a lower-than-a-slave-gladiator-pawn, he must also deal with the fact that his infant son is also being used as a hostage.  We look back on Rome now and laud her as glorious and grand, and she was.  But we forget at times that she was pregnant with men whose souls were as dark as the Ephors.  Two of those souls work for Emperor Claudius.Unfortunately, like a day dream with Lacey Chabert, all good things must come to an end.

"The good news; Ben Kane is a very good writer.  The bad news; Ben Kane lives in the U.K.  Having to wait and extra four to five months for the book release is about as fun as listening to any Kardashian talk.  The first book in this series is called `Hannibal: Enemy of Rome' and it was released stateside February 27th 2012.  This `Hannibal' short story was released May 16th, 2013.  The second book, `Hannibal: Fields of Blood' comes out September 24th, 2013.  Whoever said ""patience is a virtue"" certainly wasn't a book lover.So if you haven't read the first `Hannibal' book I would suggest you do so.  If not you might feel a little lost when you read this short story.  `Hannibal: Enemy of Rome' is a full-fledged novel that is an absolute bloody, brutal thrill to read.  `Hannibal: The Patrol' is a small appetizer meant to give us something to munch on while we wait for `Fields of Blood'.  This short story is basically a small adventure of Hanno and Mutt as they make their way to Victumulae.  You know, before they rape, murder, and pillage the place.Ben also gives us the first chapter of `Hannibal: Fields of Blood' with this short story, so that's a nice treat.  But I didn't read it.  Getting teased twice in two days is not fun.  Reading this short story was anticipation torture enough.  Reading the first chapter of a book that won't be out until September is like Zoe Saldana pulling me in for a kiss and then saying ""just kidding, I don't kiss Jeep lovers""!

"Good, but not great.  When someone asks me (and they will ask me) ""how was Dan Brown's new book?"", that will be my answer.  I enjoyed but there were more than a few places that were slow and had me scratching my head.  It's almost impossible not to read one of Dan Brown's books and NOT compare it to `The DaVinci Code'.  I know I shouldn't but I can't help it.  `The DaVinci Code' is just a plain amazing novel and has become the standard (at least by me) on how codebreaking-thrillers should be written.Would I recommend this book?  Yes, like I said it is good.  But where it got weird for me was, believe it or not, the action scenes!  When Robert and his female companion were running away from the bad guys is when it got dull.  I think Dan spent too much time explaining what was around them and the intricacies of such and such building, and why such and such building was built and when.  So much so that it really slowed the story down.  And that was weird for me.  Dan Brown usually doesn't drop the ball like that.  His research, as usual, is on point but I felt that his strongest strength was also his greatest weakness with this book.But again it was a strange dance.  When he was telling the story of Dante's `Inferno' and how it related to the story, how it played in our modern world, it was a VERY good book.  Once they started running and dodging the bad guys and he threw the history and research with them, that's when I found I had to push my way through.  This story just didn't have the same ""magic"".  I understand that not every book can be a once in a lifetime block-buster, but even the story telling didn't have the same Dan Brown-esque flair that I've grown to enjoy.I've always been a big fan of end of the world/apocalyptic books so when I started to piece together what the `Inferno' really was I got morbidly excited.  `Inferno' is pretty detailed and complicated so don't rush through it.  Setting aside the awkward slow parts that were dispersed throughout this book, it was still entertaining and fun.  The ending will catch you off guard because it's so... complete.  And horrible.  You always wonder if the author ""will go there"" and Dan Brown certainly does.As with his other novels this one has the dance between ""this can't be real"" vs. ""CAN this be real""?  I was taken by what `Inferno' referred to and I can't wait for `The Discovery Channel' and `The History Channel' to start producing shows on it.  Not to mention other media houses dusting off their old DVD and shows with the sole purpose to say ""I told you so"".  This book will definitely generate conversation and reaffirm Dan's place as the devil wordsmith of literature.  Damn him... writing these popular books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KECX9E1XYG9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537859#wasThisHelpful","R2KECX9E1XYG9G","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit it; I'm an impulse book buyer.  When Allison Hobbs posted on her FaceBook site that her and Daaimah S. Poole had published this book, it took me all of two minutes to buy it.  Why so long?  Because, I was looking to purchase this book from someplace other than Amazon... long story.  I started this book last night, finished it this evening, and now I get to tell you about it. I think I've gotten to the point where I just expect the women in Allison's book to be just plain bat crazy!  This one is no different!  I can't even be nice y'all, Shana is stupid.  Stupid, blind, and delusional.  One of the funniest moments in this book comes early when her man, Rome, actually tries to explain to her what ""KH"" stands for.  I honestly had to go back and reread that because I thought ""no one could be this damn stupid"".  But, I was wrong.  Lord help this child.Now to be fair, Rome isn't an Ivy League graduate either.  BUT if your woman is a dunce then you're going to take full advantage of her dunce-ness.  And Rome does.  OK the story: As I mentioned earlier Shana has a loser-idiot for a boyfriend.  However, in spite of this she is still giving their relationship the good `ole college try.  The problem is that Rome is giving the co-eds a little college try!  So to get back at him Shana takes a little walk on the wild side herself.  Unfortunately in her wild side travels she comes across a dude named Amir.I looked it up on Wikipedia and `Amir' in Latin stands for ""is this negro crazy""?!  Now I've had some good-good that has made me do, say, think, and imagine some crazy stuff.  But nothing like Legion's little brother here.  Most one-night stands are harmless, but what happens when you have one where the other person doesn't want to let go?  Allison and Daaimah tell you.  This is a short story that is not short on drama, sex, craziness.  I really enjoy short stories like this one because they seem to show up (for me at least) at just the right moment.  I had just finished `Inferno' by Dan Brown and I needed something fun and sexual to unwind my brain from all the Italian and code breaking.They both say they have more stories... so let's get with it!!

"I usually have a review for Eric Jerome Dickey's new book ready to go on the release date. Matter of fact I'm such a nut that I usually stay up till 12:01 AM and wait for Amazon (ugh) to ""release"" the hold so that I can post.  I didn't do that this time.  I couldn't do that this time.  Why?  Because I'm intimidated.  Why?  Would you ask Britney Spears to critique Patti LaBelle?  Would you ask the YouTube piano cat to critique Mozart?  Would you ask Napoleon Dynamite to critique Alvin Ailey?  No you wouldn't. See my problem?Ah well, it is what it is. I'll move on and hope that I can do a little bit of justice to what is the best book I have read this year. This is a story that is completely and wholly saturated in sex. But the little death  is only the engine to a much bigger vehicle. Nia Simone Bijou is back and well... she's back.  And she's matured. That in and of itself is scary.  She is a woman who is completely and totally 100% sure of what she wants. And what she wants is enough carnal pleasure and universe creating orgasms to make God question if he is indeed its creator.As per Eric , the title of  this book has as many different meanings as heaven has angels. 'Decadence'.  Can a word define itself?  Ask Nia and she'll define it for you. In deeds, thoughts, and fantasies. But I doubt you'll be ready. I wasn't. If you thought 'Pleasure' was a gumbo of eroticism, you'll swear 'Decadence' is her maternal twin.'Decadence' (noun) is an elite club that caters to the sexually free and the sexually athletic. If there was ever a club made for Nia, this would be it. No inhibitions whatsoever and you can choose to be a ""watcher"" or a ""doer"". Nia is Gemini to both, but this story becomes lusciously excruciating when she chooses to participate. Even if you don't like certain sexual situations, I defy you to read this and not be... Uummmm... moved. :-)  Nia is every man's and woman's dream and nightmare. How is it she can be both Phobetor and  Morpheus?  Read. Find out.'Decadence' (adjective, verb) is what Nia and the other club members personify. How much?  Think of an Olympic diver on the platform. Think of the pool filled with caramel. 'Decadence' is what you'll be covered in when you land. Nia indulges in decadent decadence and Eric paints a picture so vividly erotic you could see a blush on Seal.'Decadence' (adjective) also describes the love affair between Eric and his characters. The language in this book is simply... beautiful. When you read this story do so with a highlighter. (and Google Maps). If you use an eReader it will be as colorful as Lucky Charms. The sexuality between the characters is second to none, but the sensuality of the words have a sultriness all their own.  Eric is probably the only writer who will make you want to use your tongue both for sex and soliloquy. In the same damn sentence. Come for the sex, stay for the pillow talk.Now... let me get serious for a moment.  I'm a fan of Eric's because he is simply the best writer I know. I say that with 100% sincerity. But even I wasn't ready for this... page 333 until page 340 is the best writing Eric has ever done. And I'm not kidding. I'm seriously getting chills as I write this and reread that. The words are so pure in nature and so honest in their delivery that those seven pages will literally make you shake. It will make you put the book down. It will make you speed readers become slow readers and you slow readers become Medusa's lover's. Saying that time stopped would be a little too much, but saying that those seven pages made everything else not matter, isn't.I've said it before but Eric is simply, tha' man. He writes, we read. He dreams, we voyeur. He travels, we experience. He quits, we die. (OK I admit that last one was a bit melodramatic but I trust I made my point). Nia Simone Bijou. Nia Simone Bijou. Nia Simone Bijou. I wonder if I say her name three times in a mirror will she come to life...?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWWX5C3QZ5FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953833#wasThisHelpful","R2CWWX5C3QZ5FD","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the mood for a western, but I was having a hard time finding a good one.  In my frustrating search I came across this one.  The weird part is that I've read AND enjoyed the other books by Mr. Altimari, but somehow this one just managed to slip past me. Fortunately there are no expiration dates on books so I grabbed it up.And I enjoyed it as much as I have the others. Damn this man can tell stories.After I read this story I was trying to think why I enjoyed this book so. The more I thought about it the conclusion I came to was, this story was during the time when men were men, your words carried weight, and you respected your enemies. Willingly or not. Red McGregor is a burly Colonel who has just left the army and, as luck would have it, ends up right where he should be. But not where some folks want him.Katy is a little girl who is exactly where she should be as well. In this book and also as Red's friend. Now let me say this... usually I CAN'T STAND to read books with annoying, pretentious, bratty, out of place little girls. Especially a Western. All too many times they are out of place and the story surrounding them is trite, boring, dull, and in a lot of cases,  unbelievable.Not this time. If you don't fall for Katy then you have no soul. You know how you can sometimes find a rose growing from concrete?  That's her.  In the middle of all the violence, blood, and war, there is a little girl who has an effect on men that is... special.This is a western written the way western's should be written. Cowboys, Indians, brutal language, mean-ass bad guys, and just the slightest hint of saloon whores.  William is an independent author who works with an independent publishing company so he already works his butt off.  I'm going to be selfish and say that I want him to work harder because I need him to put out more books.  It is my pleasure to be able to highly recommend this book... as I have his others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLUKYRJNO40U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060AMCY6#wasThisHelpful","RVLUKYRJNO40U","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marcus Antonius Palla and Servius Ulpius Murena. After I finished this volume I sincerely had to think of the last time I read about two characters I've hated more. Cowards with power. The wield it like children and woe to you if you're in their line of fire. Pavo and Macro are only not in their line of fire, but they have their chest painted with a big fat ""kick me"" sign.This short story finds Macro as the new lanista and Pavo as the new 'first sword'. Of course neither of them wish to be there in there respective positions, but how they feel or what they want means little (very little) when it comes to the Emperor getting what HE wants.  Imagine  our sweet little Macro in charge of whipping gladiators into shape. Now imagine these same gladiators having to play second fiddle to poor-little-rich-boy Pavo.Fireworks have seen less gunpowder.What I like about Simon and his writing is that his stories are very entertaining and you can trust that each book, or installment in this case, will be the same way. It is violent in a way that isn't gratuitous but still in your face. He has drama that is almost concrete because of the way it makes you feel, but not that cheesy two-minute drama that we ALL hate.The only thing missing is the women... with as much crap as these two have to put up with I wish there was a way I could give them coin. You know... a donation to the Macro and Pavo Foundation for the Needy. Ah hell, get this volume and then impatiently wait for the final two installments.  If you've been following this series you'll notice that the release dates have been changed. 'Arena:Revenge' is now May 23rd and 'Arena: Champion' is now July 18th.One last thing: do NOT read the synopsis they have posted for the not yet released eBooks in this series.

"The pros:- Fits well in your hand and the rubber gripping is very nice.- Attractive and minimalist in design.- Very responsive to the screen.  I used this on my iPad 2, iPhone 4s, and iPad 4.- Very accurate.The cons:- The little plastic dampening clip can come off.- To protect the dampening clip from coming off this stylus must have a cover.- This cover get annoying because you have to take it on and off all too often.- You can't keep the top off because you run the chance of that dampening clip popping off and getting lost.So I do like this stylus, but because of the detachable-prone dampening clip I only find myself using this stylus only when I'm going to be at my iPad for a while and not for short clips.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOOQ492SCL1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A48R4KM#wasThisHelpful","R2SOOQ492SCL1M","A57H497OM1IJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A57H497OM1IJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice Santa figurine that is perfect for Christmas around your home.  It is extremely nice!  The figurine is large enough to place on a mantel or a table and while people will notice it, it is not too large that it dominates your decorations.  It is well made (glass) and comes with a light inside.  The light flickers like a candle which is very nice.The only drawback for mine is that the on-off switch is hard to move.

"Molina is a misunderstood theologian.  Calvinists object to him because they see him as nothing more than an Arminian.  Arminians see Molina as one of their forefathers.  In reality, Molina and his theology is his own.  Molinism is now often known as ""middle knowledge.""  In this book, Dr. Kirk MacGregor seeks to help Christians understand the man Molina as well as the theology that follows from him in Molinism.  Prominent Molinists today would be Dr. William Lane Craig.This book is a welcomed edition to students of theology.  I have Molina's works but I admit that his writings are difficult to understand.  Molina truly was a great thinker.  I often have seen Molina as more of theological philosopher than a biblical exegete who wrestled with Scripture.  While I have tipped my hat to middle knowledge regarding God's sovereignty and man's freedom, I admit that Molina always seemed distant from me.  As an Arminian, I knew that Arminius borrowed from Molina and many have suggested that it was reading Molina that greatly influenced Arminius' view of God's sovereignty and His foreknowledge of all things.  While this may be true, I was unaware of the differences between Arminius and Molina's theology.  I knew Molina rejected Calvinism but how his theology differed from Arminianism, I could not tell.In this book, Dr. MacGregor not only covers the theology of Molina but also how his theology interacts with modern Reformed theology as well as Arminianism.  MacGregor shows that Molina is not pure Catholic theology nor but is very much his own.  MacGregor also shows how Molina dealt with the Scriptures.  This was my favorite part of the book!  In chapter 5, MacGregor shows Molina's doctrine of predestination.  Here Molina interacts with the biblical texts.  Again, I thought Molina was more philosophical but in reality, Molina wrested with the texts.Overall, this book should be read by all serious disciples of Jesus.  As an Arminian, I differed here and there with Molina's views.  For example, Molina rejects the concept of corporate election of which I hold.  While I respect Molina's middle knowledge view in regards to election, I feel that he favors Calvinism too much in this place.I highly recommend this great book.  Easy to read.  Easy to grasp.  Not over the top in the language.  Well done Dr. MacGregor!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJWVV2AY9JMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310516978#wasThisHelpful","R1OJWVV2AY9JMM","A11OBEH2ZCVAHX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OBEH2ZCVAHX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great sturdy scooter. Very similar to the razor brand in my opinion. It came basically ready to ride. We just had to insert the handle bars which is super easy and then flip it up from the folded position, which is equally as simple.  It's on the small size but it fits our 9 year old perfectly. Our 11 year old who is taller than average can definitely ride it but you can tell he's not quite as comfortable on it as his brother (and that's at the highest of the adjustable heights).  There is a convenient rear brake but the boys say it's easier to just put their foot on the ground to stop. The wheels seem well made.

"This game is so fun! Our family loves this game and we have played and played it since receiving it! Not like regular tic tac toe at all, except for getting 3 of your pieces in a row. Each play gets 6 game pieces, 2 of each sizes.  You assemble the playing board with the 4 interlocking pieces. The rules are so different, you can gobble up your opponents men if you have a gobbler bigger than their piece.  You can even move one of your men that you've already played on the board. Lots of strategy and memorizing where hidden gobblers are. This is a hard concept for my 5 year old but my 11 year old loves it as much as I do.

"This white microfiber mens towel wrap is very handy. It's nice to have for getting out of the shower and not getting dressed immediately. It's got a nice sized deep pocket however the wrap is fairly thin and lightweight so anything heavier than a toothbrush pulls the wrap down some. Also, if you wear it the way it's supposed to be worn you'll want some underwear on under it if you are going to be around people because it doesn't wrap very far around, and for me that defeats the purpose. I have turned it so it doesn't open in the front but then it looks stupid because it's on sideways or backwards! (I'm a waist size of 34/35 for prospective).  It's nice enough for the money! I just personally think the only drawback is that it needs to wrap around further or stay closed better when I walk.

"This is a very well done verse by verse commentary on the book of Acts from a classical Pentecostal perspective.  The author does a good job of balancing the text as he does not make the entire book of Acts merely about the Holy Spirit.  The author explores the text and he does deal with his text.  I also appreciated that the author did not ignore difficult texts such as Acts 2:38 or 13:48.Overall disciples of Jesus will learn from the author as you read this commentary.  While some will differ with the author over his Pentecostal interpretation of Acts 2, 8, 9, 10, and 19, this should not hinder you from reading this.  One could easily read this commentary and appreciated 90% of what the author writes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBRJB6TU9HLFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0912981008#wasThisHelpful","RBRJB6TU9HLFJ","A11OBEH2ZCVAHX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OBEH2ZCVAHX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This comes with a large, very nice tin full of assorted soft caramels.  The caramels are delicious and are nicely wrapped.  The tin is very usable following finishing off the caramels.

"Let's face it, we all stink.  My mama use to say that so and so's poop smells too.  It doesn't matter if you are a Hollywood elite to a bubba in the swamp, your poop smells.  This poo-pourri is designed to cut down the smell.  In a small bathroom, this is very effective.  These sprays are strong in their scent and they have to be to cover up the poop smell.Pros:- Smells are not bad.  A bit overwhelming at times but not bad.- Small bottle can easily go with you into a bathroom and no one has to know.- Needed to cover up bad poop smells.Cons:- Bottle has to be sprayed upright and not down.  In other words, you have to get even with the john to make it effective.- Some have said their bottles leaked but mine has not.- The smell (while fine) now reminds me of poop.  Every time I smell the poo-pourri, I now think of poop.  Not good.Conclusion:If you have the money, get the poo-pourri.  It is effective.  That said, I would not buy it myself.  I am doing this review for Amazon.com and am not required to give any other views but my own.  I don't care that my poop smells to be honest and I just turn on the fan to get rid of the fumes.  Poop is poop to me and it just stinks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCUL4W5CUL6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108YTI28#wasThisHelpful","RCUL4W5CUL6V","A11OBEH2ZCVAHX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OBEH2ZCVAHX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Comes ready to play right out of the box.- Very easy even little children to do (my youngest is 5 years old and he enjoys it).- Can really fly and shoots pretty well.- Pretty durable.  The nose is made out of a suction cup and sticks to some things (flat surfaces but not our wall).Cons:- We have yet to get it to fly where we aim.  You just pull back and it just flies wherever.- Flies sort of like a paper airplane but faster and much more durable.- The targets it comes with are cheap and nothing more than cardboard.  Not useful at all.- Not waterproof so avoid water!  We played with ours in a pool and that was a fail.Conclusion:Our family enjoyed this especially my wife.  I would definitely recommend this toy and would buy them for others including myself.  They are fun.  I do wish they were waterproof because they are a blast in a pool.

Most come with a ring but these hold by magnets and is an awesome concept.- The whisk is a good size whisk and works well.- All three spatulas work well and have variations in their sizes.- The largest spatula works like a spoon and a spatula.- Very sturdy and good quality.Cons:- You obviously know that you're getting colorful sets but none of them seem to match kitchens.

While I don't plan on using it, it seems well made.Overall this is a nice set.  The price however is steep.  It is useful for travel, nice looking, excellent grooming tools.

"This is a very well done commentary on the book of Matthew.  The author does a good job of going verse by verse through the book and he examines many aspects of Matthew.  The author quotes from other commentaries (which I always enjoy when authors do this in Bible commentaries) and explores the book of Matthew from a deeper level than just reading it.  The author also points to other passages of Scripture throughout the Word of God that are relevant to the text.I say well done on this commentary and do recommend it for disciples of Jesus (John 8:31-32).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHCKJNFGXR2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MQTE50#wasThisHelpful","RBHCKJNFGXR2B","A11OBEH2ZCVAHX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OBEH2ZCVAHX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: light weight, but very sturdy when assembled, Wide base makes it untippable, easy for more than 1 kid to share, good for multiple ages (crawlers to walkers), has volume control and on/off switch.Cons: assembly took 20 minutes with a drill (would be longer with screw driver). Contains about 10 plastic pieces and about 15 screws), 1 year old can pull off the ball ramp--easy to snap back on though. Wish it had a place to store the 3 balls that keep rolling awayOverall: While the price is a bit high for this toy, it is enjoyable for young children.

Band feels like cheap ""leather"" and does not bend well.Overall:I for one think this is an impressive watch for a lower price.  While the band can be replaced (and mine will), the watch itself is nice.  I appreciate not having to squint my eyes to look at the face.

"Pros:- Well made.  The robot is durable.- Very easy to play with.  You simply point your remote at your robot trying to knock down another robot with the last one standing the winner.- Each robot comes with their weapons.- Comes with a 2X2 mat and you simply put the robots on the mat and go crazy.Cons:- This is not a quite toy.  The sound is not unbearable but it does make noise.- Hard to knock the robots down and hard to control your robot.  The robots were all over the mat but rarely at each other.- Takes 10 AAA batteries!- The only point to the game is just to knock down your opponent.OverallBoys will love this game.

"Pros:- This is well made.- Great idea.  Can keep the right kind of child busy for hours.- Easy to set up.  Comes ready to play.- Only takes three AAA batteries that go in the bomb.- The string (laser) is easy to pull out and put back in.  Lots of string to work with.-  Our 11 year old boy took this out of the box and set it up himself.  It's that easy.-  We had five boys playing with the game and they all enjoyed playing.- The game changes each time depending on how the child sets up the hooks.- Very imaginative game.Cons:- Can be frustrating since you have to hook up lots of strings and they have to be set up just right.- Not for smaller children.  They will grow frustrated trying to set this game up.Overall:I do believe this is a creative concept.  While not all children will find it appealing, imaginative children will find this game enjoyable.  This is a tricky game to put together and some children will grow frustrated quickly.  If your child enjoys building, tearing up, and then rebuilding (Legos come to mind), they will enjoy this game.  This game requires work.

"This review is of the Epson Expression ET-2550 Wireless Printer.Pros:- Size is very good for a home or small office.- Very easy to set up and use.  The display is easy to use as well.  Nothing too complicated.- Average speed on printing.- Quality of print is amazing.  Very clear and crisp.- Doesn't seem to use a lot of ink so we are hoping that the ink is long lasting.- Holds 100 papers at a time.- Easy to link up to all our wireless devices under our home network.- We printed a large picture of Super Mario and the second it came out, it was dry!- Features calendar and stationary papers.- Lightweight.Cons:- Ink is not easy to change.  You have to use a bottle and pour ink into a canister.  If you want an ink cartridge, you'll want another printer.- You must use gloves to change the ink.  While easy to do, its time consuming.Conclusion:This is a very nice printer.  I would recommend it to my friends, to small businesses.  This printer does just what we want it to do.

"This is a very nice toy for a child probably between 2-5 years of age.  It is well made, does not have small parts or blocks, and has nothing that could hurt your child.The pros of this toy are:- Durable plastic that can take a beating from a child.- Decent amount of blocks for the child to stack on (these are Mega Blocks so they are large version of Legos in essence).- The wagon moves easily across the floor and is very lightweight for a child to pull.- The wagon is suppose to swoop up the blocks as it goes alone but only picks up about half but still a cool concept.Cons:- You will likely need more Mega Blocks for older children.  Again, some come with it but not a lot.- Swoop concept only picks up about half the blocks.Overall:This is well designed, well built, and durable.  The wagon is easy to pull, requires no assembly.

"I would gladly put more than five stars for this LeapFrog.  It is simply an amazing machine.  The screen is comparable to an iPad Mini but not quite as large.  It is a beauty to look at though and the screen is clear and bright.  The screen is touch screen and comes with a stylus that is connected to the LeapFrog.  The pad also is excellent with the touching many you don't have to keep retouching letters to get them.This LeapFrog also has many cool features such as apps you can download from the LeapFrog site.  This LeapFrog also has wi-fi on the device (which is very convenient).  You have to have an account with LeapFrog to order apps but they save your credit card information for next time and the site is password protected to prevent your child from buying up apps.  My three children literally fight to play on this unit.  It's that good.The sound quality is excellent.  The battery is rechargeable and long lasting.  You can also play on the device while you charge it.  You set up the device using the device so no connecting to a computer.The camera on the LeapFrog is okay but not great.  It does what it needs to do.You can only have three profiles on the device which was perfect for us but if you have more children, that stinks.

"I just got this unit, and it works. It looks nice, but is very light, and possibly cheaply made. While plugging in the controllers, I already noticed the lights flickering. That could be because it wasn't plugged in all the way, or the connections are already loose.  Only time will tell how well this unit works.  I will update my review in a few months.  I like the charging lights. I like how the unit looks, and the ways in which it can be plugged up--Directly into the PS4 or you can use the wall adapter.  I have skins on my controllers, and one of the skins was not compatible with this unit. I have the Foamy Lizard skins that do work quite well, but some, a different brand, does not. The skin is wrapped all the way around the controller, up close to the plug, which adds just enough material in the way to impede plugging in the controller.  So that's something to look at, if you use skins on your controller. I do not like having to plug the controllers in all the time. I'm used to the cradle chargers that allow the controllers just to rest on a charging port--without plugging it in. I really liked that, but that particular charger broke in about 5 months. Which is a real shame.  I also hate having to use cables. Bummer.  All in all though, so far it's a decent little deal, and hopefully it'll hold up for longer than a couple of months.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PDBKQBNORQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128N7IPG#wasThisHelpful","R37PDBKQBNORQN","A31U2JKLG32UVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31U2JKLG32UVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like this gate. It does its job for babies, but my little 3 year old can manhandle it open, and then can't close it again.  So that poses a problem, because of the not being able to close thing--she leaves it open for my 1 year old to get to places he shouldn't get to.  She's pretty obedient though.

"I like this product, but it has some problems. It smells ok. Originally it smelled good to me, but then my husband kept saying he was smelling stomach acid...you know, that kind of sour spit up smell, on the kids. It was the soap on their skin. I can see what he's talking about, but I do know that soap smells differently on different skin types. That could be part of it. The soap itself has a mild pleasant smell--smells like coconut and Shea butter. Coconut has a pleasant smell, but Shea Butter isn't the best.  The other issue I noticed was my daughter's hair afterwards. It looks greasy after she uses it. My son's does too, but it goes away the next day. My daughter's hair continues to look greasy though. My son is more on the dryer side, so that might be why. Some one with more oily skin and hair might have a problem with this soap.  I'm going to try using less in her hair to see if that helps.  The soap, however, as a body was is wonderful! Their skin is silky smooth!  My daughter has always had beautiful skin, and I still notice a difference in softness. My son has had dryer skin, and this soap definitely suits him well.  I also love that this soap is organic and I love the ingredients. Definitely give it a shot! You could be pleasantly surprised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZS8CFDE5QXZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISATXI4#wasThisHelpful","RZS8CFDE5QXZ2","A31U2JKLG32UVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31U2JKLG32UVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this skin. Feels nice. Fits the controller well. The studs get some taking used to, but in the end I prefer them there to the traditional controller feel.  It is also nice because the back is cut out so it doesn't interfere with anything getting in the way of the mini USB port.

"I liked these skins. They fit quite nicely and are comfortable in the hand.  I have the foamy lizard studded grips for a different skin, and think I may prefer how these feel better, especially for the price.  I got 4 skins for less than the price of the studded skin. The fact that they glow is a fun added bonus.  Though only the white one glows pretty well.  The rest glow, but are muted.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I have a docking station for my controllers that requires a piece to be plugged into the mini USB port at all times. This skin infringes on the ability to use the docking station.  It was easily remedied by cutting out around the plug, but I didn't have to do that with my foamy lizard skin.  The skin is a little thinner than the foamy lizard one as well. So there is a little less protection, but the buttons protrude better.  With the foamy lizard skin the buttons are pretty much flush with the skin. That was annoying at first, but you get used to it.

Loved the gritty feel Not too abrasive, but definitely felt like it was doing its job.I have normal skin, but have some small pimples on my forehead. They are not really noticeable, but some have redness. This product seemed to lessen the redness.Cons: Skin felt very tight after using. It didn't make it oily, or have dry patches, just tight. The next day I noticed bigger pimples pop up in my temple area. It's been nearly 3 days now since I've used the product, and my face burns and itches.

"This is a great robe! I bought this because I sleep in my birthday suit, but am also the mother of 2 small children (5 months, and 2 years) I'm up and down a few times a night between feedings, and wanted something I could throw on quick, and doesn't get in the way of everything like the giant robe my husband bought me years ago. I bought a medium, and it fits just right, though slightly snug around my tummy, but that's because I still have a little bit of my baby belly. When I say slightly, I mean probably only noticeable to me. I bought a medium, and I'm 5'2.5"" at 139 lbs - muscular build - broad shoulders. It fits nicely. The 3 quarter length sleeves are perfect because they don't get in the way of anything. The material is comfy and warm enough for me during those feedings. Feedings are easy also. There is a tie closure inside the robe to keep it closed, and a sown in tie for around closure. That was a must have for me. I hate losing or wrestling with the closures of robes. THERE ARE 2 POCKETS! Not sure why this is not advertised. I bought this robe for all its other great qualities, but thought I wasn't gonna get pockets--which almost made it a deal breaker, but never fear for those of you like me who don't wanna get dressed around the house, but still wanna have your cell on you. Great robe! Wish it were in more colors than black and taupe. I really wanted a grey robe, because it wouldn't show spit up as readily, but that's truly my only complaint. Great product!

"This fits my Asus 15.6 screen computer just right (all ports can be seen and are usable without further modification).  I have the newer thinner computer--that doesn't have a disc drive.  It's also a 2 in 1, and the case does not inhibit the use in tablet mode, which is nice.  I bought the case for a little added protection and to keep the aluminum finish from getting scratched. I believe this will be a lot more added protection than those static cling covers.  The reason I gave the cover 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the color variation.  The actual color of the orange cover is a mild neon orange.  Not as bright as an orange high lighter, but headed in that direction.  Either way, it looks nothing like the photo.

"The Oxford NY Men's Pique Polo Shirt (XXL) is a very good looking and comfortable polo.  I got the ""Forest"" color and the muted green color is very appealing.  Although I typically wear a XL, the XXL is not so big that I am swimming in it and even if I have a little more material in the midriff area than I'm used to, it doesn't look like I'm wearing some over-sized bag.  The length is very good in both the waste and arms which is important as I am 6'6"" and it has plenty of shirt tail to either tuck in or leave loose, but not so much that it looks like a dress. The cotton/poly blend is soft and is similar to other shirts that I already own.  I'm not sure what the moniker is on the left breast though... Wildebeest?  Bull?

"*** NOTE: I received a free product sample in exchange for an honest review. ***The Brainwavz Kidwavz KV-100 Wireless Rechargeable Headphones are a nice pair of over-ear headphones.  The padded ear cups and head band are very comfortable and have small holes in them so that they breathe.  Although they are adjustable, they are ""kid sized"" so it probably will not fit most adults.  My seven year old uses them and she has the about 50% out (although we are all very tall so she's not a ""typical"" seven year old).  I was able to just barely get them on, but I didn't try them for very long as I didn't want to bend the head band.  We got the blue set and it is very bright and colorful!The KV-100 is very easy to charge as it simply uses a micro-USB connection (cord included).  Pairing is also easy as you simply hold the power button down and the device will show up on your music player.  My daughter doesn't have a Bluetooth music player so I simply plugged in the audio AUX cord and went from there.  Obviously the volume up/down and FFWD/REV buttons don't work if its not Bluetooth paired, but they worked well when I had it paired to my iPod.  The 85 db volume limiter is nice idea to ensure that your child doesn't fry their ears.The only issue I had was that they KV-100 is kind of pricey at $39.50 for something that your child will probably abuse.  There are many other Bluetooth headphones that are half this price - although not without all the features that the KV-100 offers.  Brainwavz is a pretty good company and the KV-100 is a nice product, but I'm not sure I'd spend almost $40 on something that stand a 50/50 chance of being broken in three months.  So maybe my complaint is I'm cheap - who knows...Overall, I (and my daughter) really liked this set of headphones and she's used them every day since I gave them to her!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10D11XE3DYSM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CNWSL4#wasThisHelpful","R10D11XE3DYSM2","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Positives:The colors are very bright, but I haven't seen any evidence of the colors bleeding.  The size of each towel (16X19"") is perfect for cleaning.Negatives:Although the page says the towels ""become more absorbent the more they are washed"", out of the box they are NOT soft and NOT absorbent at all.

I read some of the reviews where people were using the towels over paper towels and I don't get it.  These towels wouldn't soak up a water spill even if you put the towel on the spill and an walked away for an hour.  I'd use these to clean your hands after cooking or washing dishes, but if it doesn't dry your hands or soak up liquids, its not good for that either.Overall, I was very unimpressed.  I'll probably just end up using them as brightly colored rags.  At least the colors don't bleed...","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NSPE37VLKJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRI8BM#wasThisHelpful","R17NSPE37VLKJX","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own a Dell Computer that is only 4 years old.  Therefore I thought it was appropriate to try out this new Del 23"" Screen.Out of the Box it is surprisingly light.  My 22"" flat screen monitor that I bought about seven years ago weighs at least twice what the new Dell weighs.  Assembly is very easy and very intuitive.  The three-piece stand just snaps into place (and disassembles just as easy) with the last piece being a rear cover that you really don't even need.  The plug and play functions of the monitor work so well I didn't have to adjust anything when I plugged it into my computer - the resolution snapped into place and I was ready to go.  Dell supplies an instruction book and a CD with device drivers, but I just threw them away.However plugging the monitor in was an issue.  My Dell and many many new computers no longer have VGA ports on the graphics cards as the new, higher resolution technology utilizes the square DVI port and the white data cords.  The problem?  This Dell Monitor has no DVI port on it and is - honestly - the first monitor I've seen in probably 10-12 years that has only a VGA port (and I've setup 100's of computer workstations at my office).  Why Dell would manufacture a monitor that requires maybe 30% of its prospective clients to buy an adapter is beyond me.  Granted the adapter only cost me $5, but why should I have to buy one in the first place.  I would say that this monitor is being sold as a cheaper alternative, but $179 is about what you'd expect to pay for a 23"" flat screen monitor nowadays - in fact if you do a quick search on Amazon, the sales price of this unit is actually higher than average.  Just plain dumb - Dell should know better...Overall, the monitor provides beautiful graphics and the ease of install is probably the highest that I've ever dealt with.  Having to buy a $5 adapter is simply annoying and considering how great the monitor is, I'm really just going to ignore it and move on.  However, the somewhat higher than average price AND having to buy an adapter forced me to rate this product at 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RETCAIKSK94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AQIPA8#wasThisHelpful","R17RETCAIKSK94","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since the mount holds onto a vane of your air vent, it can be positioned either horizontally or vertically to aid in making it as functional as possible.The mount also includes a 360 deg ball joint so that you can position the phone the way you want it and the screw to tighten or loosen the clamp is very easy to access and turn.

"*** NOTE: I received a free product sample in exchange for an honest review. ***The Furios Guitar Capo is really a neat little product.  I've been playing guitar for years and have tried many different capos and there is a fine line between having one that stays place on your guitar neck and properly mutes the strings and one that is almost impossible to open with your non-dominant hand.  I've owned and used many guitar capos that were like vice clamps or that you really had to adjust them in order to ensure that they had a nice fit.Instead the Furios Guitar Capo actually LOOKS like it was made for a guitar.  The underside is rounded and included padded rubber so that it looks like it is almost molded to your guitar neck or actually even a part of your guitar when you put it on.  The quasi-polished exterior is also nice looking and although I'm not a fan of the color light green, it is actually starting to grow on me.  Finally the capo was very easy for me to open as well as to adjust on the fly up and down the guitar neck.  There is similar rubber padding on the string-side of the capo that does a good job of muting the strings no matter where on or in between the frets the capo is placed.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the Furios Guitar Capo and I've already donated my old capo to someone else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EX9H1S9ZPDP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N20530#wasThisHelpful","R2EX9H1S9ZPDP2","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Old Wisconsin ""Fast Fuel High Protein"" Snack is a tasty meat stick, I received both a beef stick and a Old Wisconsin Fast Fuel High Protein Honey Brown Sugar Turkey Snack Stick, but were nothing special over other competitors such as Slim Jim, Jack Links, or any of a dozen other similar competitors.  I've probably eaten a couple thousand of these meat sticks and there have been very few that I didn't like.  These were no different.  The Honey Brown Sugar Turkey flavor was tasty and interesting considering this is not a flavor I would have tried on my own.Although I greatly liked the product, I had to laugh at the marketing ploy to call these ""Fast Fuel, High Protein"".  In some ways its like slapping a sticker on a bottle of water and calling it ""Hydrating"".  Beyond that, I'm not sure that consumers go into a gas station and buy a meat stick simply because they were looking for ""Fast Fuel"".  I'm just looking for something salty and good tasting.  Thus the marketing language is it wrong - its just silly...Overall I really liked these.  I'm not too wrapped up in eating healthy or ensuring that I only ingest ""all natural"" products so my review is probably higher than others.  One of these every week or so isn't going to kill you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZQ0GMFL4DUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105DW2WU#wasThisHelpful","RGZQ0GMFL4DUF","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*** NOTE: I received a free copy of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***I've been using laundry bags for awhile.  There is nothing worse than having your bra clasp break in the wash (or hook onto and rip something else) or your nylons stretch out to 10 feet in length or your sweater turn into a mess of pill balls after taking them out of the wash so I'd kind of question the sanity of any woman who is NOT using them.I'd always used a zippered mesh bag that was basically 16"" square so I'd always had a tough time stuffing larger items into it and smaller items end up moving around inside the bag during washing.  However this set features three different flat zippered bags - 19.7 x 23.6 inch, 15.7 x 19.7 inch, and 11.8 x 15.7 inch - plus a 7 inch cylinder bag which can be used for very small items or as a little carrying/storage case for your bags.  The flat bags seem like they wouldn't allow much water in, but after laundering my clothes they came out smelling just as fresh and clean as the items that were not inside the mesh bags.  Drying is just as easy as you simply leave the item in the bag and toss it into the drying.  Note if your items are jammed pretty tightly into the bag, they might not dry very thoroughly so use your common sense when using these for drying.Overall I really liked the Besteek Laundry Bag Set.  They wore well in the washer and dryer and the set is very useful either in the laundry room or as storage cases in your home or while traveling.  The $10 price is pretty reasonable as well, as it is somewhat on the lower end of a sampling of similar products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGH5T0WARFY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154ADR9Q#wasThisHelpful","RHGH5T0WARFY2","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*** NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***The TLTrading Floating Pen/Pencil Holder Desk Organizer is a very functional pen/pencil holder while also being a very convincing conversation piece.  Made of a two pieces of molded plastic, the bucket (with metal wire handle) is attached to a piece of clear plastic through a ""hole"" in the side of the bucket.  With the air bubbles within the water spout and the puddling on the base, it really gives the illusion of water rushing out of the bucket.Overall I liked the pen/pencil holder.  I was able to get about 20 normal pens/pencils or 10 heavier pens in the bucket without thinking that the plastic water spout would snap.  However therein lies the only drawback that I saw.  There are two key weak points in the design (where the water spout connects to the bucket and where it connects to the horizontal base) and they are both thin plastic (3/16"" and 1/4"" thick respectively) and are thus susceptible to breaking.  So as a functional novelty, the TLTrading Floating Pen/Pencil Holder Desk Organizer is very cool.

"The Real FX Racing Starter Kit is a quantum leap over the slot cars of your youth.  Included in the box are 20 track pieces, two cars, and two controllers.  Once you put in the batteries into the cars and controllers (three AAA batteries each - 12 batteries total), they are ready to roll.Although there are six track layouts shown in the instruction manual, track creation is basically up to you and can be anything you dream up as long as you create a closed circuit.  There are 20 track pieces (six straight, ten 45 deg corners, two reverse corners, and two pits lanes) and with the straight sections about 36"" long, when you put a track together using all 20 pieces, the track can be as long or as wide as six feet.  Also included in those tracks are two ""pit stop"" pieces which are necessary for the advanced racing options.  The tracks are made of plastic and are very thin and flexible (similar to construction paper).  The track pieces are held together by small tabs on the front edge that slide into slots on the other piece and are assembled and taken apart in seconds - clean up literally takes about 30 seconds.  After placing the ""starting grid"" piece, you simply follow the arrows on this piece and connect the track from there overlapping each piece as shown in the instructions.The cars turn off and on with a switch on the bottom of the car and controllers at the touch of the main power button.  Racing noises, such as engine revving, spin outs, and blown motors are all heard through the speaker on the controller.  Optionally you can plug headphones into the audio jack on the side of the controller.  Pairing the controller to each of the cars is also a snap and takes very little setup.  Once you have the tracks constructed, several of the driving modes allow for AI assist - the cars follow the tracks on their own and you can do as little as just control their speed.  If you go too fast, they will still fly off the track on corners, but it’s a good way to get a feel for driving without having to drive the whole track on your own.  Once you speed up to the point where the car could go off the track, you simply use the ""steering wheel"" on the side of the controller to manually control the car to keep it on the track.  Actually competitive racing can be done either against an AI ""pace car"" or a human opponent with the pace car having two different difficulty modes.  Other options allow for different racing parameters such as road/car hazards (oil slicks, incorrectly shifting gears, and tire wear) and the amount of laps you want to race against either an AI or human opponent.  Finally, you can set the cars on full RC mode to run around the track (or your house) without any AI assistance.Overall, I found the Real FX Racing Starter Kit to be a whole lot of fun.  All my kids (ages 7, 11, and 14) and myself and enjoyed setting up different track layouts and racing against each other.  The learning curve was not too steep due to the AI assistance modes available - in fact my 7 year old only used that mode and simply sped up or slowed down the car while racing against the other vehicle set in pace car mode.  One drawback I saw was that the wheels come off a little too easy.  Two or three times a race when one of our cars would fly off the track, one of our wheels would fall off.  I understand the need to take the wheels off, in order to keep the axle free of hair and debris, and it is very easy to put the wheel back on, but it was still annoying to have to bend down and put the car back together while you are being lapped on the track.  I'd also like to see the company come out with an expansion product with additional tracks as it would be fun to make even larger circuits.  Other than that, I had zero issues with the set.  The tracks are very easy to clean off and the batteries seem to last for quite awhile as we have yet to have to replace any.  Good stuff!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQG3IBZ0XIDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NQG3IBZ0XIDH","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*** NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***The Wisdompro 3-in-1 iPhone 6 Cell Phone Case is very heavy duty.  I really like the multi-functional nature of the case as the belt clip turns into a desktop ""kickstand"" with the use of the metal loop internal to the belt clip.  This stand has several different positions and is very easy to deploy and put back.  In addition there is a smaller kickstand on the cell phone case itself that clicks into place after pulling it loose from the rear of the case.  The belt case unit has a soft interior surface to cushion and protect your phone screen which is nice - I'm not sure I've seen that before.Inside the package along with the three-part case you also get one removable screen protector, a dust rag, and a 4.5"" stylus.  I swear by the screen protectors as I have them on all my iDevices and my work Blackberry.  They take a while to get used to how to put them on, but no device should be without them.The only real drawback with this case is that everything fits VERY tightly.  It took me 10 minutes to properly ""push"" the rubber interior case into the hard case properly.  Since the rubber sleeve is malleable, it kept wanting to protrude out into various places it shouldn't.  Once you have the two-piece phone case together, the fit into the belt case is also VERY tight - basically requiring me to look down and ensure I was positioning it correctly every time I put my phone away.  The good thing in all that is that the phone is very secure and you really have to try and break it.Overall, despite the work I had to put in to get the case together, I really liked the case as it very securely takes care of my phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JIAJWTSURSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HTWDXM#wasThisHelpful","R27JIAJWTSURSG","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lucien Piccard Taverna Men's is a very classically fashionable men's watch.  The bronze hour/minute hands and hour marks beautifully contrast with the silver watch face.  The date is shown set within a really nice sundial/starburst pattern with 12 hour marks.  Time and date are set via the dial on the right side of the watch.  I love the look of the silver/bronze watch with the black watch band - very professional looking.HOWEVER, the watch band itself is awful.  It is a deployant clasp system like you'd see on metal watch bands.  Its bad enough that I had to Google the clasp and watch a Youtube video JUST TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPEN IT, but then when I actually tried to put it on, I figured out that if you have large hands you will have a tough time wearing it.  At least with metal watch bands, you can have the clasp adjusted so that it expands larger or smaller depending on your hand and/or wrist size.  Not so with the Lucien Piccard clasp.  Once you set the point on the band where you want it to close to, it only opens so large and for someone with smaller wrists and large hands (I'm 6'6""), it is not possible to slip the watch band over your hand.  So I was forced to open up the watch band and try to set and deploy the clasp one-handed.  It can be done, but it is a colossal pain in the rear end and honestly isn't worth my time.  Instead I went to the neighborhood convenience store, bought a $12 leather watch band and chucked the original watchband.  It's a shame too because I'm sure this watchband isn't cheap.Overall, my hate of the deployant clasp system on a leather watch band greatly overcame my love of the watch.  I've bought several mid-high end watches - all with leather bands - and this is the first one I've ever received that has a deployant clasp.  In my opinion, if you are going to deliver a watch where this is the primary band, you should include in the package a normal backup leather watchband.  Considering this watch originally sold for $362, you'd think that would be the least they could do...","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J34SUCAYMTWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXIJ5M#wasThisHelpful","R2J34SUCAYMTWH","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***The UNU Aero Wireless iPhone 6 Battery Case is actually pretty darn cool.  Out of the box, you get the case, the charging base, a USB/micro USB cable and an audio cable with female end on one side and a male end on the other.  The case has a charging connector inside it and you just plug your iPhone in as you slide it into the case.  After connecting the charging pad to the micro USB connector and the connecting the USB side of that cord to a plug (not provided), the pad is ready to go.  Whenever your phone needs to be charge, you just set it down on the pad and a second later it starts charging.The case contains a 3000 mAh internal battery which is supposed to give you up to 14 hours of useful life.  I can attest that the battery lasts for quite sometime as I only had to charge my phone once in a week.  I'm not a power user like some teenagers I've seen, but that's still a long.  Although the charging pad and the case are somewhat integral to each other, you can charge the battery case without it as there is a micro USB connector on the case.The only drawback I see is that the case has no belt clip.  I know a lot of people like to put their phones in their pockets, purses, or backpacks, but that's not me.  Because of where the battery is, I don't think you can install a belt loop so I understand the problem.  A minor issue is due to the thickness of the case, you cannot access the audio port on your phone.  This is where the short audio cable comes in.  Just plug the cable into the audio port of your phone and then plug the female end of the cable into your headset.  Its kind of important to hang onto the cable though.Overall I really liked this case eventhough I had to stuff it into my pocket.  The battery extends the life of your phone several fold and it is very clean and sophisticated looking!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30S1H5JKYAMGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EGFOK6#wasThisHelpful","R30S1H5JKYAMGU","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***The IBRA 6 Feet High Speed HDMI Cable is clearly a high quality product.  I liked the black woven cloth sheathing and that it was thick enough to resist being kinked or bent (unlike - apparently - the cord I just took off my Blueray player which looks like it is almost broken).  The ends are 24K gold plated to improve the connectivity between the cord and the unit and ensure you have no transmission loss (most stock cables are aluminum).  The cord supports up 2160p.  The 13 foot length is super long - maybe a little too long to connect up anything you need at your entertainment center.  However, it can be very useful if you have to set your XBOX 360 or PS4 away from the rest of your electronics if you have no space in my entertainment center like me.  Since I got two cables, I put one on my cable box and the other on my Blueray player so I shouldn't see any resolution issues for now on.Overall I really liked this cord.  In the case of wiring for your entertainment pleasure, bigger is always better.  However, the cable thickness on this monster actually slightly impeded its usefulness as it is tough to maneuver it around bends and in tight spaces.  Because of this, I disconnected a number of other cords, ran this one first in as straight a line as I could and then reconnected the rest of the cords.

She also liked the case as we opened it carefully so that she could continue to use it to store her supplies.Although I had given her my engineering drafting pack from college which still had several different pencils in it, this set really expanded what I had already given her and will great aid her in developing her burgeoning artistic talent.

"*** NOTE: I received a free product sample in exchange for an honest review. ***Wolverine's brown Men's Basic Milled Leather Strap Belt is a very heavy duty belt and reminds me of belts that ranchers would wear.  The belt itself is made of very thick (3/16"" thick and 1 11/16"" wide) and very rugged leather and is much wider and thicker than any belt I've ever purchased (I own three other belts and the BIGGEST one is 1/16"" thick and 1 1/4"" wide).  In fact it was a little bit of a struggle to even get it through the belt loops and a bigger struggle to get it through the front loop after buckling it and it is too wide for my iPhone clip.The construction of the belt appears to be very high grade.  The brown dye is very strong in color, the 2 1/4"" long brass-colored belt buckle appears to be very strong, and the belt is tightly stitched together on the edges.  The underside of the belt is soft and smooth leather.  Highlighting the quality construction, the seven belt notches are reinforced by a strip of leather on the underside of the belt.I ordered a 40"" belt because I have a 35/36"" waist and wanted to make sure I had some overlap.  I'm not sure how Wolverine sizes their belts, but the belt arrived and it is 47 1/4"" long.  That seems huge, but honestly it seems like the belt is the perfect size.  I'm using the third of seven belt notches and after buckling the belt, I have 6 1/2"" of belt left from the where the buckle attaches to the belt to the end of the belt and 4"" from the belt loop on my pants to the end of the belt which is basically perfect.  Because I'm not on the first or last belt notch, I have room to gain or lose weight without having to buy another belt.Overall, I really liked the belt.  I would have liked it a little more if it wasn't so wide (1 1/2"" would have been a little more preferable) as the width of the belt is basically the same width as the belt loops on my jeans and its wider than my iPhone case clip.  However, you really can't fault the construction of the belt and by the looks of it, the belt is going to last for years!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D612ALBD9DYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00752M3OW#wasThisHelpful","R2D612ALBD9DYC","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have been using a set of Sony MDR-J10 Headphones with Non-Slip Design at work to listen to music as well as to do on-line work-related classes. I like them because the sound is nice, they give good overall audio range playback, and are comfortable on my ear AND if someone steals them, I'm only out about $13.  I typically do not like buying earbuds because the one-size-fits-all manufacturing is rarely a size that fits ""ME"" - the earbuds are either too big or too little or sound like crap or have a cord that's too short or whatever.The Soundpeats M20 headset has a metal housing which is nice and the sound cords are of the the rubbery ""spaghetti"" variety which resists tangling. Soundpeats does not include the hard case like some of the other, more expensive, headsets that I've gotten, which is too bad but then you get what you pay for. There were two other earpieces in the box so you have another set plastic tips in case you lose yours or they get too full of ""crud"".I compared the M20 headset to the other headsets I have and the sound is very comparable to some of the higher end ($40-$50) earbuds that I own.  One thing to note is that since the M20's also include a microphone, the speaker plug has three sheaths on it.  This is compared to normal earbuds/headphones that have only two sheaths on the plug.  So if you plug it into an audio extension cord or a basic MP3 player that are designed for two sheath plugs, the sound will be very bad - it'll sound almost like mono.  However, if you plug the M20 into your phone or iPad or other microphone-capable device, the sound will be normal.Overall, I thought that the Soundpeats M20 was a nice pair of earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5HXD7TQVDAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RXUX60#wasThisHelpful","R1M5HXD7TQVDAA","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Myfox BU0201 Smart Home Alarm System is a pretty slick DIY alarm system, however it does have its drawbacks.In the ""starter"" system, you get the main alarm unit, one key fob, and one door/window ""intelliTAG"".  Once you download the Myfox app, it takes only about a minute to tie the app into the ""Link"" homestation, apply the intelliTAG to one or your door/window openings, and then set the round alarm in a central location.  The Myfox ""Link"" system allows up to 50 alarm devices, 50 key fobs, or four security cameras (all sold separately) so the system is very dynamic and expandable.  The intelliTAG's use detection algorithms to determine whether a blow to your window is someone trying to break in or just someone knocking.  I wasn't able to test this, since I'm not going to try and break down my own door, but this is a pretty neat function.  The key fob ""talks"" to the intelliTAG so that you don't set the alarm off when walking into your own house and with different key fobs, you'll know who enters/exits your house and when.  The key fob looks classically stylish in white, but is pretty large with a diameter similar to a half dollar and about a half inch in diameter.  With the fob on my key chain, it was pretty large to stuff in jeans my pocket.I'd like say that you have an initially large purchase and then the expansion of the system is relatively inexpensive, but this is not really the case with Myfox.  Each additional intelliTAG costs $49.99 (Myfox BU2002 IntelliTAG, Smart Sensor for Home Alarm (White)) so in my house I would need to spend almost $800 to alarm all my windows and doors and my first floor alone.  Want to install cameras?  They cost $199.99 a piece (Myfox Wi-Fi Security Camera) plus $29.99 for a wall-mount bracket (Myfox BU4010 Wall Mount, Bracket for Security Camera (White)).  So if I were to install three of them (one at my front door, one at the back and one at the garage) and mount them all with Myfox brackets, it would be almost $690.  Need more than one key fob?  They cost $29.99 apiece (Myfox BU3001 Wireless Keyfob).  I would need four more for my family so that would be almost $120.  So a system that seems pretty economical at a starter price of $279, now looks like its a gigantic money dump at a price north of $1600 to cover my house.Overall, I'm not really sure if this is a project that I would want to invest in because you really can't just have the starter unit and call it good.  If you are in for a penny, you are in for pound and if you were to by the base homestation unit, you are basically signing up to alarm the rest of your house which will probably run you close to $2000 at the minimum.  Is it worth it?  The system is certainly advanced with the intelliTAG's being able to tell the difference between a bird strike and someone actually trying to break into your house so I guess you just have to decide how much your peace of mind costs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UID50NDT8PD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWBUP2K#wasThisHelpful","R3UID50NDT8PD4","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** NOTE: I received a free product sample in exchange for an honest review. ***The Stickcons Bling Stickers For Your Sneakers are honestly pretty awesome!  In the package you get hundreds of little reflective rhinestones that have self-adhesive glue on the back.  The stones are connected in chains so that you can attach them in nice long, straight rows without having to put them on one at a time and having your rows look like heck.  If you want to make smaller patterns with the chains, simply take a scissors and cut the little strings anywhere you want and go wild!  I was somewhat concerned that the glue wouldn't attache correctly to cloth sneakers, since the product photo has the Stickcons attached to smooth rubber, but neither of my daughters had any problem putting them on either of their pairs of tennis shoes (as you can see in the attached pictures).Overall, I couldn't have been happier with the Stickcons - it was super easy to apply the Stickcons (my seven- and ten-year old daughters each spent 5 minutes - tops - on their ""creations"") and my daughters absolutely loved the look of them.  I'm not sure how long they'll last, but my daughters will enjoy showing off their fancy shoes until the Stickcons drop off!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CGJ5ARMOVI13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYF1Z88#wasThisHelpful","R1CGJ5ARMOVI13","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I (and more importantly my seven-year old daughter) really liked the Zebra Cadoozles Starters Mechanical Pencil set.  They are very easy to hold and write with and the clicking action to advance more lead is very easy to depress.  The multiple colors are a fun way to write whether you are doing school work (with mom's or the teacher's approval) or whether you are just scribbling.  I always use mechanical pencils at work, since they never need to be sharpened and you can select pencils with varying lead hardness and thickness and its just one more skill for little kids to learn.One thing I think its necessary to note, even if it seems pretty obvious to me, is that these are NOT coloring pencils.  Nowhere on the product does it say these are coloring pencils.  They are mechanical pencils and as such the hard, thin lead is not really suitable for coloring pages.  You can do shading, but the coloring will be light.  So make sure you know what you are buying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LUDOB4RNGRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105U1YV8#wasThisHelpful","R36LUDOB4RNGRD","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Otterbox iPad Mini Folio Case is probably the most heavy duty, impact resistant case I've ever seen/used as the magnetized folio cover completely wraps around the front face of the iPad Mini to cover the screen and secures magnetically to the rear of the case.  The exterior cover is a woven cloth that  is smooth to the touch while the interior is a textured rubber coating.  Although it is unneeded with the rubberized interior, I would still buy the screen protectors that you can get three for $1 from many different Amazon vendors.The hard plastic shell is also entirely rubber-coated and holds your iPad Mini.  In fact its so tight, it takes a little effort to put it in and pull it out again.  The shell is perfectly cut with openings all the in the proper places for your rear camera, audio port, speaker, and microphone.  In addition, the volume buttons are raised above the case, but take a firm push in order to actuate the two buttons.  The hard case also rotates so that you can view the iPad Mini display in either portrait or landscape mode.  When stood up, the rubber interior keeps the iPad Mini angled upright in four grooves (the product imagery shows five grooves, but mine has four).Overall, there are some drawbacks from the sturdiness of the case design.  For starters, the case weighs almost as much as my iPad Mini itself (13.6 oz as compared to 15 oz for my version of the iPad Mini).  13.6 oz isn't really significant, but when it almost doubles the weight of your product, it is very noticeable.  Secondly, the cover is clearly designed for users who prefer to place their iPad Mini's on a table or desk as the cover is VERY VERY awkward to hold when you flip it open and use your iPad Mini in your hands.  There is a way to do it - you essentially fold the cover back on itself, but it feels weird.  Again the weight comes into consideration here as it makes the iPad Mini that much heaver to hold.  Finally the front edge of the flap that wraps around the back of the case does not lie flat like is shown in the product imagery and sits curled up in front of your iPad Mini when you have it sitting on a table or desk.  Since it has a big magnet in it, all Otterbox had to do was put a magnet on the inside face of the cover and you could have pushed this lip down on itself.Overall I liked it and its a great cover for traveling as you could drive a car over the case and nothing would happen, but for everyday use in my opinion it is too heavy and bulky for convenience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260OGRFHWYXMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBNTNEY#wasThisHelpful","R260OGRFHWYXMI","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter really loved the Crayola Story By Me kit.  Enclosed you'll find a blank cover page (plus a spare), 16 story pages, a submittal page with a place for your child's picture and a short bio, and instructions for submitting the package to get your child's story turned in for printing.  Once completed, Crayola will send you one copy (on 5.5"" X 8"" paper) plus the access number to order additional copies for either yourself or relatives.  Shipping both ways is included in the price of the product.  An eight-color set of washable markers is included with the box.Before my daughter starting writing/drawing her story, I made a copy of the story page, the submittal page, and the cover page so that I could make replacement pages in case she made a mistake.  This was a good thing because she decided that the first page she did ""wasn't good enough"" and threw it away.  The book can be up to 16 pages so it pays to make extra copies.  Although you could use the markers to draw pictures and write the story, I would suggest that your child use a pend or pencil for the story part as Crayola will not correct misspellings so if they can't read the words, your child may be disappointed in Crayola's ""interpretation"" of what he/she wrote.I know that it is relatively simple to self-publish your own books nowadays, but having all the templates and pages laid out for you to just follow was handy.  And $22 for all the pages, markers, the book, and shipping both ways seems to be a fair price to me.  There is a hardbound version of the ""Crayola Story By Me"" (Crayola Story By Me Hardcover Kit) that is $28, designed for a slightly older child (age 6 and up), and gives you a 7""x9"" hardcover book.**********UPDATE**************My daughter finally got around to finishing her book and it turned out GREAT!  It took app 3 weeks for Crayola to send the book back to us and it was all printed on glossy paper and staple bound.  The cover page and all the inside pages are essentially photo transfers of whatever your child writes or draws so be aware of that.  Not only do they not correct spelling errors (which is stated on the instructions), they do not retype any of the written words.  The only thing that Crayola types is the ""About The Author"" and the ""Dedication"" sections.  My daughter was so happy to get this and Crayola even sent a bookmark along with it.

"The ACCO Five Star Locker Organizer is pretty decent.  The magnet on the back is very strong, which follows the product literature, and appears to be ""slam proof"" for school lockers.The four round magnets are also strong and hold paper onto the whiteboard equally well.  There are four pushpins that are shipped on a rubber block.  I threw away the rubber block as it is not attached to the whiteboard and will fly around your locker when you close it.  There are ample holes in the lower front face to push the pins in which is fabulous.  However, the number of pins shipped is somewhat inadequate - you probably want to grab 5 or 6 more thumbtacks to augment those shipped along with the product.The pen, although somewhat cheap, writes and erases adequately.  You need to push very hard to completely erase even fresh writing which leads me to believe that writing that has been on the board for several days/weeks will be troublesome to erase.  The primary drawback I saw in the whole package was the pen itself - it just doesn't stay on the board as the magnet is very weak.  I even removed the plastic covering around the eraser so that the magnet would be in direct contact with the board and it didn't help.  If you slam your locker, this thing is going to go flying everywhere.  Maybe if you put it in the little gap between the locker face and the front of the whiteboard it might stay in place, but I doubt it.  Seems to be a pretty obvious design flaw.Overall, I thought the Fiver Star Locker Organizer was up to the task despite the issues with the marker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTDKV1NSWNC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NQJY8#wasThisHelpful","ROTDKV1NSWNC7","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in return for an honest review. **The Lavievert Leather and Canvass Laptop Case/Bag is a very attractive and functional unit for you to use as a work bag or for those people who travel.  The pocket for your laptop is just under 14"" long and about 8"" deep so depending on the thickness of your laptop, you can fit probably a 13.5 inch laptop in the bad.  I don't own a MacBook and my HP laptop has a 17"" screen, but as you can see from the pictures it fits an standard sized iPad plus a legal pad with room to spare.Inside there is a plethora of pockets including those for business/credit cards, pens and pencils, note pads, phones, other small electronics, and two zippable pockets (one of netting) to put in such things as charging cords, change, keys, money, etc.  With both the iPad and a legal notepad in the large slot and several of the smaller pockets full, I had no problem closing the case and fitting the magnetic snaps together.  The Interior and exterior is made of a sturdy blue canvass which is smartly contrasted with the leather top and snaps.Overall, I can see my wife using this on a daily basis for her home business.

"*** NOTE: I received a free copy of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***As a 6'6"" person, I've always had back pain and misc joint pain (probably from under-exercising). In my current job, I spend many days a year traveling and between the criminally small airplane seats and strange beds, I frequently have back and neck pain that sticks with me during my business trips and for days after I return. I have taken Glucosamine and Chondroitin in the past and I always felt like it helped to smooth out my aches and pains, but its probably been 10 yrs since I've taken it regularly. Because of my mildly chronic pain issues, I jumped at the chance to try out 100 Naturals 1500 mg of Glucosamine, 1200 mg of Chondroitin, and 2000 mg MSM tablets. There are many different suppliers of Glucosamine on the market and on Amazon and 100 Natural's product is in the same price range per pill as most of the others - some higher, some lower, but most of them are right around $0.10 a pill.After taking the product religiously for 3 weeks (five pills daily which I split up into two separate doses), I experienced a reduction in my overall pain level, stiffness in my back, neck, lower legs, and joints in general, and saw improvement in my overall mobility. However, this did not come overnight.  One thing people need to remember is that most supplements take a few days or weeks to build up to the point where they are having a noticeable affect on you.  This is why you see alot of reviews that say ""I took this for a week and nothing happened.  It sucks!"" - when if the person had used it for another week he may have experienced the positive effects he was looking for.  Maybe, maybe not.  Its tough to tell sometimes as you will get one person who swears by the product and another who didn't get anything out of it.  As a 45-yr old male, I experience urinary issues so I've been taking Saw Palmetto to help with it. I know for a fact it is helping because I've gone off it several times to make sure its still worth buying and I can tell the difference when I've stopped the supplement. However, my urologist tells me he rarely prescribes it to his patients because its so hit and miss. Some nutritional supplements are just like that.So although this bottle only lasts for 40 days, which doesn't seem like a long time for $23, it has more Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and MSM than most of the joint supplement products that I've seen (and tried) on Amazon.

"I found ""Devotion"" to be an interesting combination of a ""War Story"" meets ""Buddy Book"".  ""Devotion"" tells the true story of Naval pilots Tom Hudner and Jesse Brown and their exploits and struggles during the early days of the Korean War.  Told in repeated flashbacks, author Adam Makos delves into their personal lives to flesh out the reasons for the color-blind affinity between the pair as well as their exploits in and out of the cockpit prior to their defining moments which are kicked off when Brown is shot down over Chinese-held Korean territory.  Parallel to the recounting of the exploits of the two pilots, Makos also follows several Marine soldiers who later fought as the 1st Marine Division in the Chosin River Valley in the winter of 1950 when the Chinese stormed across the Yalu River and nearly surrounded the lead elements of the UN force in North Korea.I've seen comparisons between this book and Laura Hillenbrand's ""Unbroken"".  Additional, his writing style and extensive use of actual dialogue from events that are from over 65 years ago (which must have included a certain amount of ""artistic license"") somewhat mirror the books of author Jeff Shaara.  However, having read both Unbroken and several Shaara books honestly the comparison is only superficial and Makos' book should really stand on its own as a classic unto itself.  The only REAL similarity I saw in Devotion and the Jeff Shaara books that I read were that I really grew to know the men in the book such that I felt every death as if I had been there.  Buy-in to the tale being spun and swaying you to emotion is a rare quality in an author.Overall, I greatly enjoyed the book.  The self-sacrificial and ""I was just doing my duty"" example that Tom Hudner shows us in ""Devotion"" as well as the struggles that Jesse Brown endured in Jim Crow America and the Navy should be held up as a role model for all of us, young and old alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLTSQCTIMDCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176582#wasThisHelpful","RGLTSQCTIMDCO","A1BXVZSQOJE6UE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BXVZSQOJE6UE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Mascara is always more difficult to remove but it can be done with this product and the ingredients list is better than most others on the market.

It also has a elastic band to hold a stylus, 2 small open-ended ""pockets"" for cards, papers, whatever, and my favorite thing - an elastic strap to slip my hand under so I don't have to grip the edge and accidentally turn an unwanted page, no accidental backing out of a game just as I'm about to defeat a difficult level, and I won't be turning it off as I hold it.  I ride a ferry to and from work each day and with this WACO folio I can drape the cover over the top of the steering wheel to read - no hands required.  If I were designing a folio case for my G-Tab4 it would look just like this with all of the same features.It also has an elastic band that holds the cover in the open position unlike my Snugg iPad 2 Leather Case Cover and Flip Stand with Elastic Hand Strap I have for my iPad which does not have the band to hold the open cover open.For the price I was not expecting something so well made and nice looking.

In fact, he is considering buying one for his garage. The lock looks high tech and kind of classy.

"Works like a dream. The onscreen touch pad makes scrolling and finding controls simple and intuitive.  I like that it holds a full ream of paper, but of course that makes it rather large - not a consideration for me but could be if space is limited.  I've scanned and printed wirelessly from my iPad and computer plus from a memory stick.  I do wish it had a slot for an SD card though.I've had other wireless printers including Epsons, HPs, and a Brother.  This was the first time I had to download a driver to get a printer to connect wirelessly.  Not a big deal but it did irritate me a bit since all of my other printers magically connected in seconds.While the printing is fast and clear, The color isn't quite as exact as I'd like.  As a quilter, I sometimes copy fabric to ""preview"" my design.  Fabric is a difficult copy with all printers I've used, but this printer seemed to be slightly less accurate in terms of color matching.  I also copied and printed a PowerPoint slide and that color was ever so slightly off as well.  I'm not saying it's a deal breaker for me, but I could see it as a problem for those whose intent is color perfection.  My Epson XP610 does a better job achieving color accuracy.This has all of the features one would need for a home office or small business.  My favorite feature is that it prints on both sides automatically; no manual page flipping is required.My concern is, or rather will be, its ink consumption.  Both of my other Epson printers drink ink at an unbelievable rate.  (Almost cheaper to replace the printer 4-5 times a year than buy ink!).  Perhaps the money I save on paper can be applied towards ink.All in all, I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to others.

"I am an 11 year old Black Lab.  I love to swim at the beach, hike in the woods, go snowshoeing, and romp through mud puddles.  I am very clean but Mom sometimes thinks I need a bath.  Now that I'm older she says my feet smell like ""old dog"" feet - whatever that means... She got this shampoo and used it on me and went on and on about how great I smell.  I think it smells weird - not dog-like at all.  What's wrong with old dog feet?  But if it makes her happy and I get an extra biscuit out of the deal then so what?  I'll put up with it even though the Doberman next door and the 2 Mastiffs on the other side tell me I smell like a girlie Poodle.  Not the image I'm going for.Humans!?!?

"I'm in a hotel in Chile - well into my vacation.  This LP book is of little to no help whatsoever.  I have traveled internationally for decades and always relied on LP with great success.  This Chile & Easter Island 2012 version is nearly useless.  Not the usual hotel and dining recommendations and reviews; very limited and the better options are missing.  Everything sounds the same, for instance all the restaurants sound the same, not enough detail to draw from when making a decision.Also missing is the personalized pieces of advice I've grown accustom to in my other LP books.  In Chile one of the key issues is finding public restrooms.  Other LP books inform you of this difficulty when traveling to certain countries or regions.  This book does not.  FYI: if you look desperate small store or gas station owners will usually let you use them after apologizing for the cleanliness and condition.  (When you're desperate to go, who cares?).  Most do not want the toilet paper (if they have any) to be flushed.Truthfully, this book seems to have been written by someone who has not thoroughly traveled the country.  The descriptions are somewhat neutral and seem similar; almost cut-&-paste-like.  I have used LP books as my only source of information and advice when traveling to Morocco, Iceland, Korea, Sweden, and Norway.  Thanks to LP each of those trips was fabulous.  This current trip to Chile will be also be fabulous but not as a result of the ease of referring to LP.  I hope this Chile book is an anomaly rather than the 'new and improved' way of supplying us with information.  If so, I'll be switching to another source.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33KZXNY3VJE5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009IC7G94#wasThisHelpful","R33KZXNY3VJE5N","A2DXXJR0N8BXOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXXJR0N8BXOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've read some great books by King, including one of my favorites, 11/22/63. With expectations high, I opened to the first page of Revival.Revival is a quick, easy read, but if you're looking for something different from King, look elsewhere. It starts in Castle County, Maine, with a young boy who is wowed by the town's new preacher, a charismatic man with a penchant for electricity. When the preacher loses his family in an accident, he abandons his religious beliefs and leaves town. The boy grows up, joins a rock band, and eventually runs into the preacher-turned-carny act later in life.It all seems very familiar from King. Once again, he leads into nostalgia and what seem like semi-autobiographical snippets about '66 Ford Galaxies, losing virginity, playing rhythm guitar in rock bands, carnivals, and dealing with heroin addiction. He meanders. He throws out bits of quasi-wisdom learned over time. To keep some tension, he keeps reminding us of the former reverend and his electricity-inspired ""cures."" It all promises a horrifying, disturbing conclusion, which it tries very hard to deliver, but it all dies before it can be revived. King's attempt to scare us is based on nothing more substantial than his own juvenile fears from reading Lovecraft books. His version of the afterlife is just as hard to swallow as any of the ones he tries to debunk.I was hoping for something new and fresh from King, but Revival doesn't live up to its own name. I wanted to like this. I tried to like this. In the end, though, I was very disappointed. I felt like King was beating a dead horse. And in fact, he was. He gives us a glimpse of his motivation behind this story, directly referencing the book Heaven is for Real, and its notion of a wonderful afterlife. Revival seems to be his stony-eyed answer to that, his peek into the void. And it's a ludicrous, silly peek. There is not even one full page of genuine suspense or fear. King's earned his right to some nostalgic rambling, but we've heard it all before from him. I'm ready for a real Revival.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUU5IZ7P80CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476770387#wasThisHelpful","R1PUU5IZ7P80CE","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The spiral slicer arrived quickly, and it's a nice looking gadget. I loved the idea of a quick and easy kitchen tool for adding some style and pizazz to salads, casseroles, and so on. In theory, it all works well. You put your vegetable of choice in either end and twist, the same way you would a screwdriver. The blades, which are very sharp, slice and dispense into your bowl or dish. Easy enough.A few small quibbles, though. First, the stainless steel handles aren't real smooth on the edges, and I was almost afraid I'd get cut when gripping them tightly. That didn't happen, but it would be nice if they were smoothed. The entire tool is lightweight, which is nice, but it feels like it could break in my large hands. (I'm a six-foot tall guy.) Also, the video I thought would come with the order is actually something you access online.Overall, the spiral slicer performs as advertised, though I would've liked to see it upgraded on toughness and smoothness of the handles. If you intend to do lots of big-party prep, this will wear you out, as it's all done by hand. For smaller scenarios, it's a perfect little item, and quick for setup and cleaning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38SB0DIC7MHD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPLDX86#wasThisHelpful","R38SB0DIC7MHD3","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was surprised to see that my unit had only a 1-year warranty mentioned on it, when the Amazon page states that it has a 2-year warranty. Perhaps they're getting rid of old stock first, but that is a big difference in promises stated.Overall, this product is easy to use, and has the potential to save lives.

"I ordered and received this quickly through the mail, hoping for good things. I didn't expect it to work so effectively, though! The Powerbank Flashlight does everything as advertised. It has a very powerful flashlight beam, while still fitting in your pocket. It can be used on a dim switch and strobe switch as well. And, for road trips, camping trips, flights, whatever, it works fantastically at charging any item you can connect it to with the included USB cord, from laptops to cell phones. Now if only this had a way to attach it to keychain or belt loop, it would be perfect. This is now an indispensable part of my supplies for any trip, and it's just plain handy around the house. I love the my Powerbank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0MKDNZ7PLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV5Q0WM#wasThisHelpful","RL0MKDNZ7PLB","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a handy little urinal for our young grandson. He loves the color and design, and we're thankful for anything that helps him stay on task when it comes to potty-training. The spinning target is a great little twist, to keep a young man focused. And it's not difficult to dump this into the big people's toilet and rinse it if need be. My only real complaint, and it could be an issue for others, is that it's made to fasten to a tile bathroom wall, which just isn't the norm in American bathrooms. It can stand on its own, on the floor, but there is the risk of it being knocked over, and it then sits lower than expected. Surely, there's a way to make this work better for US customers. Still, it's a nice little training tool for those with young ones in the house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXZ0RX37WZY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY4YUW6#wasThisHelpful","R3BXZ0RX37WZY4","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ninie Hammon continues to impress. Each of her novels takes us on a journey into the hearts and minds of a wide cast of characters, and each story dives deeply into serious subjects. Don't get me wrong. Her books will entertain you and keep you flipping the pages. She pulls no punches, and no characters are safe. But she will also move you emotionally, whether she's exploring the horrors of genocide in Sudan, the nuances of the death penalty, the pain of abuse, or the effects of drugs on a small community.In ""Home Grown,"" we meet Sarabeth Bingham, a woman returning after college to her hometown in the hills of Kentucky. Her father, the newspaper editor, has been murdered, and she must not only deal with his funeral but with the trial of the indicted killer. When she takes over her dad's paper, she doesn't realize that it will lead her on a deadly trail into the truth of the county's drug market and the real identity of her dad's killer. She meets old friends, makes new enemies, and flirts with love. Lurking, though, at the edges of her world, a ruthless man will stop at nothing to keep her from bringing down his kingdom.Hammon takes the real-life facts of one of the nation's largest drug busts, over 182 tons of illegally grown marijuana, and mixes those in with some memorable characters and unforgettable scenes. This is hard-hitting stuff, showing us drug use, brutal murders, and suicides. As usual, Hammon spends some time setting up her story and conflicts. There's a lot to keep track of, and there are at least five main characters with ""B"" names, which makes that chore tougher, but she twists all these plot threads into a story that you can't put down.This is the fourth Hammon novel I've read, and I can't wait for her fifth, ""Black Sunshine."" I know it will serve up more of her trademarks: unflinching honesty, relevant issues, deep characterization, and a climax full of suspense and surprises.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2906NY55ABFGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979903564#wasThisHelpful","R2906NY55ABFGB","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"H.G. Wells is one of my favorite authors, and so it was with no small thrill that I discovered this relatively unknown work of his in my local library. At under 100 pages, it is a one-sitting story, and I plowed through it quickly.Our first-person narrator is a croquet player, an Englishman raised by his wealthy aunt. While sitting on a terrace at a resort of sorts, he strikes up a conversation with a doctor. The doctor feels the need to get a weight off his chest, and our croquet player agrees to hear him out. Soon, the doctor works himself into a froth, worried about some Evil that lurks about the premises and beyond, something that others think even oozes up from the ground. The croquet player thinks over these things, then meets another doctor the next day. This doctor says the first man has been driven mad by the fears of modern man's violence and monstrous inclinations. But this doctor seems nearly as mad, his insanity wrapped in a sense of man's primitive past that has reared up through modern civilities and displayed its true colors.Written between the two world wars, this novella is an attempt to study the dark side of human nature. Wells, devoted to evolutionary and Darwinistic theory, tries as he may to come up with an explanation for an evolving humanity that seems instead to be devolving on many levels. He makes a concerted attempt to debunk any religious types in his book (and in most of his books, for that matter), but he fails to come up with anything as frightening or believable as Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyl and Hyde symbolism. Sadly, his scientific effort at a metaphysical question comes up flat. Nevetheless, I love his scientific honesty to face the question at all.In the end, the croquet player is given a choice between being a quiet, apathetic victim to this evil, or being a vigilante who fights against it. The croquet player's final decision is a telling and ironic one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J0FTX6U8Y1EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803298420#wasThisHelpful","R1J0FTX6U8Y1EP","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like Jules Verne (whom Wells references in this novel), H.G. Wells wrote with keen imagination and a prophetic eye. From his cautionary tale in ""War of the Worlds"" to his ethical explorations in ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" Wells added a rich and controlled anger in his writing. He coupled imaginative storytelling with a readable style that endures over a century later.""The First Men in the Moon"" suffers from its now-known lack of accuracy in details regarding the moon, but that makes it no less enjoyable. In fact, this is one of the more carefree and adventurous of Wells' books. From the moment Mr. Bedford encounters an inventor named Cavor to the moment they leave earth's atmosphere to the scenes in which they battle Selenites in the craters of the moon, we are pulled along in this surprisingly fast-paced, funny, and creative tale. And, though some details are now outdated, there are quite a few that proved remarkable accurate, considering men did not land on the moon for nearly seven decades after this book was penned.I loved Wells' ideas with the fauna, mooncalves, and social systems within the Selenite colonies. He brings great energy and fun to this story. Near the end, he proves his prophetic abilities when he says, ""All about me . . . a leathery noise like the rustling of beetle wings, and a great bleating and twittering."" Seems he even predicted Twitter. Regarding a book as serious as ""War of the Worlds,"" I would never make such a wisecrack, but ""The First Men in the Moon"" is a book worth a few hours of fun, adventure, and a few smiles along the way. Only in its final pages does Wells give us a characteristic caution, and one with a touch of sad irony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYPXJIM5N4TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XHNMKS#wasThisHelpful","R2UYPXJIM5N4TW","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of Steinbeck's earlier novels, ""To a God Unknown"" is often overlooked by teachers and avid readers. Reviews here gave me two incorrect impressions: first, that it was set in the early 1800s, when it's actually the early 1900s; second, that it's preachy, when it's actually full of questions and murky answers. And that's what I liked best about it.""To a God Unknown"" follows Joseph Wayne, who has been blessed by his dying father. Joseph heads from Vermont to California's rich farmlands. He believes his father is watching over his endeavors, embodied in a tree on the land. He loves his homestead, invites his brothers and their families to join him, and together they create a paradise for themselves. Yet darkness lurks along the edges, in a glade full of foreboding, and in the dissensions between siblings. It's hard not to be reminded in small ways of the biblical story of Joseph, blessed by his father, disparaged by his brothers, but neither the biblical references nor the pagan sacrifices can be easily categorized here.Steinbeck spent five years writing this book, though it's a barely a third the length of ""East of Eden,"" which was written much quicker. I can see the wrestling here in the characters, Joseph, Elizabeth, Rama, and so on. Each of them views life and death through different eyes and beliefs. Each of them embraces or shuns the land, based on these beliefs. Steinbeck gives rich descriptions of the terrain and the foliage, and he inhabits it with this rich cast of characters. As in almost all of his works, the vibrant energy of life throbs throughout, and yet is laced with the inevitability of death.While not my favorite Steinbeck novel, I'm amazed that this is not better known and talked about more. It is full of deep searching and struggle. These people wrestle to understand God, the land, life, love, and death. They make courageous choices and foolish ones. In the end, they seem to be children in so many ways, trying to please a God unknown.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R74V0OYJHPF7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140187510#wasThisHelpful","R74V0OYJHPF7M","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stephen Zimmer is a prolific writer, producing five thick volumes in two separate series over the last few years. His imagination knows few bounds, and he draws from a deep interest in spiritual themes, political dangers, and human emotions. Spirit, soul, and body all get their time on the page.""The Seventh Throne"" tells the continuing Rising Dawn Saga, with humanity threatened by greedy business, dictatorial governments, and polluted scientific and medical endeavors. On the streets of a country patterned after America, young men and women resist armed troops and try to get videotapes into the public eye, revealing the conspiracies taking place. Our mortal heroes also face threats from Fallen Avatars, Nephilim, and renegade An-Ki (werewolfish creatures). On the good side, though, many An-Ki want to help the humans, and Adonai has not left mankind without assistance through Watchers and Avatars. Even as these battles take place on familiar soil, Frederick and his cohorts dive into the depths of the Void and the Abyss, on a search for Erishkegal, who long ago showed mercy to the children of the Nephilim and took a huge risk that has paid off in unexpected ways. Frederick's journeys are mind-stretching, awe-inspiring, terrible, and awesome. And woven into all of these, Zimmer gives us bits of wisdom about the nature of man, the nature of good and evil, and the beauty of redemption and grace.I enjoyed the first two volumes in The Rising Dawn Saga, recognizing the breadth and depth of Zimmer's vision, but at times found myself skimming sections that included long descriptive passages and a large cast of characters. In this third volume, it all clicks. I didn't want to miss a word. The descriptions are beyond most anything I've read in fantasy, from mythic monsters to emotional human connections, and the creativity is delivered with a barrage of ideas. Zimmer paints an urban fantasy that ranges from the darkest shades of the Abyss to the brightest hues of Adonai's heaven. In between, we find humans fighting dictatorial forces, wolfish creatures walking the earth, and demonic beings applying their deceptions to governmental decisions.In ""The Seventh Throne,"" Zimmer reminds us what ""epic"" truly means, as opposed to its cheap application to so many things in today's society. My mind was stretched, my heart touched, and my breath taken away. Then, to raise the stakes even higher for the next book, Zimmer delivered a final surprise that shifts our paradigm once again. On every level, this throne rules!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OLQA3K8W8E15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983740240#wasThisHelpful","R2OLQA3K8W8E15","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a fan of biblical Daniel, admiring his struggles against his culture, his tendency to dream and interpret dreams, and his courage in the face of the lions. As a child, I read his story over and over, so I approached Kingstone Media's ""Babylon"" with a bit of skepticism.Boy, was I proven wrong!""Babylon"" is a work of art, bringing to life the story of Daniel, of King Nebuchadnezzar, and of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace. Those scenes alone are almost worth the price of this volume. The colors are so rich, the panels exploding with meaning.I never imagined seeing biblical scenes brought to the page with this much drama and vibrancy. If ""Babylon"" is an indication of the quality of artists and storytellers in the Kingstone stable, than this is a new medium worth watching, reading, and supporting. I'm a novelist with one of Kingstone's imprints, but these comic/graphic-novels are turning me into a fan of this style of storytelling as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENIOWYYECKNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936164264#wasThisHelpful","RENIOWYYECKNX","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Last Convert of John Harper"" is based on a true story of a kid who had brushes with death, later became a pastor, and ended up on the fateful voyage of the Titanic.The story is an engaging one, and some of the artwork and coloring of the Titanic's final moments are gripping. The research is handled well, and the drawings take us back to that time period, which many know well from the James Cameron film. While John Harper's story leads off this enjoyable comic, a scene from the Titanic might've given it a stronger hook and then allowed us to go back and revisit John's childhood and his compulsion to preach the gospel. Instead, we get a bit bogged down in that preachiness, before discovering the power of this true tale.""The Last Convert"" is a great reminder of God's working in all of our lives, from young to old. The historical bits are footnoted, giving this story some great research and background in the back pages. It's worth the money, especially for those who feel called to share the gospel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8TSSDTHVJW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979903572#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8TSSDTHVJW6","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever wondered if Dekker would write something to equal his Circle Trilogy? Fear not. Ever wondered if he could collaborate with another author and come up with something even better than his individual novels? Fear not. Ted Dekker gives us high-concept storytelling, while Tosca Lee provides her seamless prose to deliver the first book in a new trilogy--""Forbidden,"" ""Mortal,"" and ""Sovereign.""""Forbidden"" tells the story of Rom Sebastian, an artisan in the distant future who becomes the recipient of a mysterious vial of blood. This blood holds emotions in it, love, anger, jealousy, and sorrow. But in the future painted by Dekker and Lee, humanity is barely human, having had all other emotions genetically weeded out except for fear. Fear keeps everyone in line, obeying the Order, and safe. It's a brilliant concept, exploring what it means to be human, to be alive. It also explores the seductive dangers of remaining stale but safe. Even as Rom discovers new emotions exploding within and tries to use them for good, his counterpart, the son of the reigning Sovereign, has manufactured his own way to experience emotions and uses them for selfishness and evil. Soon, these two men are on a collision course for the rule of the nations and the choice between fear (Order) or freedom (Chaos).The story starts with a somewhat drab feel, intentionally displaying the results of this ""safe"" world. It soon picks up speed as Rom and his companions set out on a mission to find a prophesied boy who will lead the way toward something new. Yes, there are quite a few recurring motifs from Dekker's earlier books, particularly the Circle Trilogy--everything from horses, alleyways, blood, and wastelands--but it is given a whole new direction here, which I loved. I would've liked more world-building, though, since the story is set nearly 500 years in the future. While we see references to electricity and underground trains, they seem to be forgotten as horses and a more mythic feel take over. Security systems seem nonexistent, for example, which could've been easily explained by the fact this is a ""safe"" society where such things are unnecessary.Despite the tiny quibbles, ""Forbidden"" is a great start to a new trilogy, at times reminding me of the repression in ""Fahrenheit 451,"" and at others, of the political infighting in ""Gladiator."" The narrative sparkles, while the action scenes get increasingly intense. A beating heart pulses between these pages. And the conclusion leaves us thirsty for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8X00WA2VO28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599953544#wasThisHelpful","R1H8X00WA2VO28","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up in the church, I saw a constant struggle by parents and pastors to get young ones interested in reading the Bible. New translations and flashy covers were attempted, with some success. But what Kingstone Media does with this colorful adaptation to the comic/graphic-novel is a wonder.This is only volume one, which takes us through the first half of the Old Testament, with vibrant storytelling and pictures. We see Moses receiving the Ten Commandment, Esther becoming queen, Samson fighting with a donkey's jaw bone, and Elijah swept into heaven in a chariot. It is easy to follow and beautifully sketched. A thread runs through the volume, showing the constant search and desire for a redeemer, a savior, giving us promise of greater stories to come in future volumes. Although the adherence to a strict 4000-yr-old earth is not something I necessarily agree with (there is a lot of time available in the time the ""earth was formless and void""), I found no quibbles biblically with the interpretations here.Kingstone is the answer I was looking for as a kid and a young teen.

"On the recommendation of some Nigerian friends, my wife and I grabbed a copy of ""Skin"" and sat down for a Saturday evening movie. We expected good things, but we were bowled over by the deep questions and emotion in this film, based upon the true story of Sandra Laing growing up in South Africa during the time of apartheid.Sandra looks black. Which means she cannot be in a relationship with a white or even shop in the same store as the whites. But here parents are both white, and her mother swears that she has never been unfaithful. As Sandra heads to school, the color of her skin becomes an issue for students and parents, not to mention a heartless school master. Sandra's father vows to fight for her, and indeed the question of Sandra's identity is taken to the supreme court, where they judgment decades ago was based solely on appearance. Sandra is classified ""black,"" but later, when genetics and heritage became the standard, her classification is changed to ""white.""The problem is that Sandra now finds herself in love with a black man. Her father is outraged and goes to extremes to stop the relationship. Her mother seems to be on her side, but then turns against her, stuck between an angry, violent husband and their grown daughter. Sandra is forced to make choices, more than once, that deal with heritage, color, identity, and family. Does love cross these lines? Does love erase these lines?In the end, ""Skin"" is a powerful movie, told with honesty, grace, hardship, and a cast of fantastic actors. The emotions range from humor to horror to sorrow to muted joy. It is a story that reminds us not only of the injustice of apartheid and racism, but of what it means to be human. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZX92P65PPXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D45NZ6#wasThisHelpful","RHZX92P65PPXY","A1CHM200OEN65X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CHM200OEN65X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice playmat, obviously fits in with the Schleich farm and horse figures and buildings.My biggest criticism is that when using fence on top of this mat, it is VERY wobbly, and constantly falling down.  Just a breath seems to knock any standing pieces over, and I'm not sure if that's due to the pile of the carpet (maybe it could be tighter to prevent this?), or maybe how light the pieces themselves are.In any case, a nice mat for your Schleich stuff, not garish at all like some playmats, but I do wish the edges had weights or something, as the kids keep  tripping on them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUFXGSB7S606/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J80IY1U#wasThisHelpful","R1FUFXGSB7S606","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried several ""calming"" products over the years for my dog, from the pet store bought, to Amazon, and this is so far the best I have found.I first used it with my 75 lb mutt (13 YO) on 4th of July when we were at my sister's house and I had forgotten to bring my current stock of calming tabs.  Thankfully she had some (this brand in fact), and they worked great!  In the midst of the large fireworks show going on nearby, he was fine!  Couldn't believe it.  He gets more nervous when my 3 kids are being loud and rough in the same room he is, so that is quite a feat.Anyway, I received this to review, after I had already tried it, and realizing it was the same brand only after I got it!

"So I have three kids under 10, and have had several ""kids"" phones, most of which are crap (and they were also highly rated I might add).  I assume the manufacturers of the other ones I have spent all their product design budget on cutesy design or durability, and none on the drivers or sound quality.This is the first pair that I would listen to myself, just because the sound quality is quite decent.One thing missing on these that I have seen on all other kid designated headphones, is a separate volume control.  These don't have one, so I guess they are ""kids"" due to the high impact plastic used, the size, and the colorful design, as well as the max decibel ceiling.As mentioned in another headphone review I wrote, maybe most parents (and apparently manufacturers) don't care about sound quality for their kids.  They probably think that crummy sound is good enough for kids, or simply don't care themselves, .  But I have a different view.I consider music to be a very important developmental step for kids, so I really am interested in letting them hear GOOD music (along with any other crap they may like, which is fine), AND good sounding music.So these headphones definitely deliver in that category, but if you really must have the in line volume control for some reason, you will need to look at other models.  I personally have not found that to be such a great add on myself.  And these ARE sound volume limited, so the thing that concerns me most from a hearing safety concern, is already there.These seem quite durable, fit great, and the cord is not over long, like the Kidz Gear pair we have, which is in a constant state of tangletude.Highly recommended if you care at all about sound quality for your kids.The other models I have tried most recently and compared to these are:KidzGear - Huge cord = tangled mess.  Sound slightly better than the truly awful sounding Califones below, but not much betterCalifone (the ones that have animal faces on the ear ups) - these were the absolute worst for sound quality, but they have the best tangle free cord of the three","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTPWY6ND2NRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY9LCIA#wasThisHelpful","RQTPWY6ND2NRV","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just to get this out of the way right off the bat, the link that was shipped to me was not working properly on arrival.  The Link is a small plastic disc shaped object, but they require that you insert the actual prong that goes into the outlet, into the Link, which I think is problematic (and not just for me apparently).Mine didn't work at all, even when I heard the ""click"" that indicates the plug is seated properly.  Myfox may want to consider shipping the Link already connected IMO.  I'm no engineer, but I would guess that is where the problem lies.Anyway, customer service was top notch, and I got a replacement piece immediately, which worked perfectly, and from that point on, setup was extremely easy.In practice, I like this system overall, but my biggest criticism is the potential cost to make it minimally effective (unless you want to roll the dice and only buy one link for the door or window you think someone will try to break in).You are only shipped with one FOB, which lets the system know if someone came in or out the door, and can set or deactivate the system, so if you have more than one person at home, that's going to be an extra $30 per person (on top of the $279 system as shipped).  You also only receive one sensor, which is great if you only have one door and no windows.  If you have several doors and windows like most of surburbia, I hope you are wealthy, because this is going to cost you.  $50 for every sensor adds up fast.  For me personally, if I were to tally the costs for my home:$279 for the base unit - covers one door, and includes one FOBextra FOB for wife: $302 sensors for back door and door to patio: $1005 sensors for external, ground level windows:$250So for me, if I wanted to be covered, and taking full advantage of the FOB functionality, the cost would be $659.  If you have kids, and want fobs for them also, keep adding.Now onto the good, which is considerable.  First, the design and aesthetics of the whole system is top notch.  The key fob is nice and small, and svelte, even.  The sensors are hardly noticeable, and are one piece units (not two like traditional magnet based systems).The alarm is nice and LOUD.  When we accidentally set up off the alarm at 6:30 the first morning, I went close to the siren unit and could feel the sound waves pummeling my kidney.  It's that loud.I LOVE the fact that you can adjust the sensitivity of the sensors from the app...that is just awesome functionality in my book.I do think they need to add a one pager to the material shipped to you with tips, or even add tips to the app setup process - like ""where to place the sensor (I had to dig in the FAQ to find that best practice for placement is horizontal or vertical, depending on whether or not it's a door or window, and for doors, at the top, about 2/3 the width of door AWAY from the hinge).I will not be buying the camera personally, just because I don't feel the need to, but I will be buying another fob and some additional sensors.  I have tried a few systems (some with cameras, some not), and I like this one the best so far, and feel comfortable going ""all in"".Recommended, with the cost caveat depending on # family members and doors/windows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8Q6RTEJCYCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWBUP2K#wasThisHelpful","R1L8Q6RTEJCYCG","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 13 YO mixed breed has not been eating well lately at all...skipping meals, not eating his ""morning crunchy bone"" per normal, and VERY little food at night.  Probably due to heat, but maybe due to age as well, not sure.Anyhoo, I thought I would try this out to see if he ate it any better, and even though the first time I mixed it up, I thought it was way too watery, he lapped it up like he had never eaten before!  So maybe he is just tired of his current food (and I buy premium stuff).So just based on that anecdotal evidence, and the fact that it's easy to store, mix and serve, I am quite pleased with the results.The fact that he didn't get sick switching on the fly like that from his current food to this, was a bonus as well.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91YW7I8WJCS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DD6#wasThisHelpful","R91YW7I8WJCS1","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that strikes you about this beast is how good it feels in your hands...really solid, built well...quality.The second thing that strikes you (me at least), after you screw the lid on, and test out the button, is how cheaply made the top is.  The button is so mushy and cheap compared to the rest of the mug, that it really stands out.Having owned soo many of these type vacuum mugs over the course of a decade, I feel confident predicting that the top mechanism will wear out long before the container does...leaving you with a topless (!) mug.Seriously, if you're going to put in the obvious effort to make and market something as being quality, do it right!  ESPECIALLY the top.  9/10 failures or problems on my previous mugs have been with the lids.Anybody can make a sturdy metal cylinder...but to make a well built lid for that cylinder that lasts...that is apparently a challenge based on what I've seen in the market.  I give the container itself 5 stars, but the lid, 1 star.  Thus the 3 star rating...""It's OK"".EDIT:  I hate to downgrade, but I took another star off this mug because after several uses, that top is worse than I first feared.  Just horrible action.

"EDIT (11/10/15)See update below  - added one star after finishing the bottleOK shampoo, but I use it just occasionally, and only for our 4YO boy - simply not enough conditioning (if any?) going on in this bottle for longer girls hair.Smell is quite overpowering, but not unpleasant - I would say right on the verge of smelling like teen spirit (AXE, etc), so if you or your kids are allergic to strong fragrances, stay away.  Also, if you are looking for natural ingredients, stay away, you won't find it here.And that's not a knock...as I said, I use this occasionally, to get the slight (hopefully) boost in moisture that my son's hair needs on occasion.  I also use more natural/environmentally friendly shampoos on a more frequent basis with him since there are sooo many options for that now.Almost doesn't make sense to buy these chemically heavy shampoos anymore unless price is absolutely the highest concern.UPDATE:  I added one star to this since it does something that many ""combo"" kids' hair wash (shampoo + conditioner) do not, which is really moisturize the hair.  At first I didn't notice, because it is subtle, but I can really tell a difference when using this, that the conditioner is in there, and works.  It's obviously not the same effect as using a dedicated conditioner, so it's more like Pert, in that it conditions a little.OTOH, I REALLY hate the ""fragrance"" - it's really strong, and smells like eau de hooker to me.  Not taking off for the fragrance, because that is a personal preference, but thought I would note that it is obnoxious and overpowering (to me).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294T4AM41OTFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VA4FYO#wasThisHelpful","R294T4AM41OTFJ","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Really like this line from Dove, and have used the facial cleanser/moisturizer for men, the deodorant, and now this bar form soap.I started using it because they used to offer an unscented version as well (throughout the line as far as I could tell), but it appears they have stopped producing that option unfortunately.I like this bar because it's dual purpose face/body, and I have to admit, I feel like the little beads clean a bit better than normal smooth soap after working outside in the yard for 2 hours in 100 weather.The only downside for me personally is the scent, which thankfully is not too strong, relative to other similar ""men"" products, but it's definitely noticeable.  Not taking stars off for that as it's just a personal preference, but really, IMO, if you want to smell like something, use some decent cologne, instead of smelling like an unholy potpourri of the cheap fragrances they put in these cleaning products, from shampoo, to hair products, to shaving cream, to soap.  /rant","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R225RRHGJ9I0L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMXW9HS#wasThisHelpful","R225RRHGJ9I0L6","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Much better than other utensils I have had in the past.The only big nasty here (and it's a pretty big one) is the very cheap bent steel which is very sharp, and I am not referring to the tiny blades that grate, but the actual edges that are folded up.  On the ends of the blade, are two extremely chintzy black plastic pieces which I imagine will be off after one washing.Still for the cost, hard to argue much here.

"Excellent earbuds that are by far the most comfortable I have ever tried.IMO, NO earbuds are actually comfortable for very long, but after at least 6 or 8 others I have tried, these are by far the MOST comfortable of those.  I think it's due to the largish design that at least for my ears, allowed them to stay in place, which is my biggest gripe about buds in general - constantly falling out.Also should note that you receive a very nice case, with more than enough different sized plugs for your specific ear hole shape.  The default ones that came with mine were ever so slightly big, and when I went to the next size down, heaven!If I could give 4.5 stars, I would, as the sound is also REALLY good in these.  Also probably due to the size of the drivers, which comparably, are huge compared to other buds.Really impressed with these overall, and can highly recommend them to anyone who might be opposed in general to the idea or feel of typical earbuds.

"I hesitate to give this 4 stars, and I do so only because the product works (so far) as advertised.We bought a new minivan recently, and I noticed in amazement, how long the tires stayed shiny weeks after buying the car off the lot (new).  I wonder now if the dealership didn't use this or a similar product on their car lot.The good:- works GREAT so far, but I do have my doubts about the 6 month claim...that seems...excessively long.- everything you need is included in the box, no skill, or weird, specific car care tools needed- REALLY makes a difference in how your vehicle looks...deep shine on black surfaces has a tendency to do thatThe bad:- Really just one, but it's a doozie.  OMG, SO many little rules and disclaimers built into the instructions (thus the almost 3 star rating).  For me personally, it's right on the line of ""that's way too much effort for shiny tires"", but if you are a car nut, or clean car freak, this is the product for you.  Yes, it takes a lot of work, but yes it also delivers the results that you won't get from just spraying some STP tire cleaner foam on your tires and leaving it.Some of the restrictions are:1. Must be in a well ventilated area (believe it sister, this stuff smells REALLY toxic)2. Must not apply in heat or sunshine3. Must not get wet (they even list DEW as ""getting wet"" and recommend you put the car in the garage for 24 hrs after applying) after application4. tire must be ABSOLUTELY free of all dirt, grease, oxidation, etc.  Until when you wipe it with a white cloth, it comes away clean.  Do you realize how HARD you must work at cleaning tires to get to that point?  It's not easy, and the tire I used this on are relatively new.  Can only imagine the effort involved for older tires.So as you can see, yes, the product is brilliant, but I would only recommend for car care freaks who already spend tons of time cleaning and using chamois on their Preciousesssss.  Others need not apply, and in fact you can even make the tire looks worse with streaking and whatnot if you don't follow the instructions (according again, to the instructions).  And apparently, if you DO screw up, and it streaks, another coat will not fix it!

"This is the second compression shirt from Underworks I bought after being blown away by the tank top version (""body shirt"").For some reason though, Underworks does not have a consistent size policy.  They list a chest size of 44-47 for XL on this ""chest binder"", but on the other Underworks shirt I bought, 44 would be L, and the only difference between the two is the width of the material on top of the shoulders...one is wide, and one is narrow like a traditional tank top).  XL for the ""body shirt"" is 49-53!  Huge difference, and I think even an inch off in size (for your chest) would make a world of difference in the effect and fit.So the 'body shirt' (with the narrower shoulder strips) fits me PERFECTLY, with my measured 44"" chest.  I bought this chest binder in XL using their scale (XL = 44-47), which is a bit loose, and the results of the slimming effect are obvious less than the other shirt.I will say that the extra width of the shoulder straps on this shirt makes it easier to put on and off (the thin strips of the body shirt/tank top, tend to roll up too easily I think)But overall, my impression from both shirts is astonishment and how comfortable they are, and how well they slim my chest, which frankly is embarrassing (used to work out my pecs daily at a gym, for years, and now they are paying me back for that!).Cannot recommend this strongly enough, but make sure of fit.  Hopefully the company is good with returns.  IMO it should be REALLY difficult to get on and off, but not uncomfortable once in place.

"Used this without any preconceived notion except maybe for the brand, which I am ambivalent about for the most part.But after spending some time on my '08 Mazda CX-9, wow!  Completely impressed.  Mom was visiting while I was doing my car, and I was so impressed (and so was she), that I did her mini-van as well.There are some materials that really improve with a coating or two of this, compared to others, but specifically of note are tires, which prevents me from using the nasty tire foam I have used for years, and windshield wipers, which seem to ""grey out"" first.Really, very impressed with this so far, even though it takes quite a bit of elbow grease, if you want great results.  I could see how if you are not a neat person, you might make a mess with this, so buyer beware.  It's basically like shoe dye...so make you you have a wet paper towel or something handy while applying.Also, like other similar products, I think the answer to optimal results is LAYERS, not one heavy coat.  Put on an initial coat, then come back and another.  If it's REALLY greyed out, you may need one more.I am leery of the claimed ""more than one year"" shine, but even 6 months with this kind of difference in look would be worth it IMO.Highly recommend if you have lots of black rubber and plastic parts on the exterior of your car.  In my particular case, the molded plastic parts responded much better to the coats than rubber, which tended to streak when applied, but still looked better than previously.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DHDN7ORLK3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOBSZJK#wasThisHelpful","R24DHDN7ORLK3Y","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been in sales for about 20 years now, constantly flying to other countries, so luggage is something I am quite familiar with, having bought more than a few cases this size over the years (at least 5 or 6).I also have three young kids who often travel, so I have tried different kids luggage as well.I have high hopes for this in terms of durability, as the last attempt at having each kid have their own cutesy suitcase ended with me carrying the broken (during the trip) animal-faced hard cases due to shoddy quality.  Smiling anthropomorphic luggage is great until it breaks, and then those smiles seem to be sneering at you and your fumbling.  Evil.Anyhoo, this piece looks like it smartly rides the line between ""adult"" luggage, and the cute, but poorly made kiddy stuff.Overall, construction seems tight, but I do wonder about the longevity of the plastic clam shell which is a little thin (I am sure, due to making it as light as possible).  We'll see - I will report back after a few trips.Also note that the verbiage claims ""in line skate wheels"", and uhhhh, no.  Wheels, yes, but not the inline skate variety that you see on so much luggage these days (and in line skates for that matter!).  Still, the wheels seem fine - again, need to test further to see how they hold up.If you care about looks when it comes to luggage (I don't, but my 10 year old who uses this does), you will be fine, here.  Very good presentation, not to kiddy, but still a little fun.  I can see a teen using this even, without any shame.Fasten points are nice and sturdy, rolls really well, ridiculously smooth, and the variety of options in terms of moving the bag are REALLY nice when traveling.  This is a spinner, but it also has handles on two side, and of course you can pull behind you as well (on two wheels).So far, highly recommended on first look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2FK22BYW9J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPC4490#wasThisHelpful","R2J2FK22BYW9J1","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, it is tinted purple, but a.  it's incredibly weak, and would not even light up some black light glowing spiderwebs 2 feet in front of it, and b. even when things were placed directly in front of it, it didn't give it that glow that you get with a proper black light.I guess I will keep looking for MR16 black lights, but this is sure not it, and wow what an expensive lesson.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFAQ6YQFTKTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XJC4SA#wasThisHelpful","R2NFAQ6YQFTKTH","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will start off by saying that I recognize that this company produces some of the highest rated shower caddies on Amazon, but for my particular shower and tastes I guess, it just does not impress at all.First, it's very cheaply made, and shows.  The fact that it's so light weight means it will likely be moving around a lot in your shower, even when there are bottles in it.There are no suction cups, or even rubber backing on this to prevent or minimize sliding/movement/swinging, so that was a bit of a letdown.More to the point, is that the actual sizes of the non-adjustable shelves doesn't make sense, since the lowest shelf is extremely short, almost forcing you to put most items in the top shelf, which is awkward.One thing I do like is the blue plastic on the front - it's a nice touch and really makes it look nicer than just a wire rack BUT it also obstructs your view of the things behind it.  Double edged sword I guess.I was looking to replace our rusted over the shower door unit, which has a towel rack on the exterior side, and a similar rack to this one on the inside, but I am still searching for a better solution to either of these.  Thinking maybe a tension adjustable pole is the way to go here, even knowing the prices are way way up there on those (but hopefully a more permanent solution, and would look nicer to boot).Just can't recommend this one with so many others out there, including ASIN: B002XISHF2 .","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MR6UHMQBELM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF0FNS0#wasThisHelpful","R14MR6UHMQBELM","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since I'm not a food biologist, I really don't have a way of knowing how the content of these compares to the extremely expensive pills for joint support that my vet suggested for my dog.I can only note that compared to the hard, but clean pills, the way these are packaged seems inconvenient and unnecessary on two points:1. My dog eats the pills as quickly/easily as he does these very messy, stinky globs of chewy.2. The package is such that when you pull back the celophane wrapper, it stays curled back and ""open"" as it were.  Nothing to close it back or keep it fresh (or keep bugs or whatnot from trying to get to it).Again, it's hard to comment on the quality of the ingredients (which seem to be very similar to the ones in my expensive vet pills), but as for the other traits, I personally didn't like the packaging (compared to other ""systems"", or even just dry pills, whose bottle top you can just close shut, and don't get your hands all nasty when you get them out), so I would not buy these normally, especially with so many other options out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GT3JTD7SVJO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J13J9Q#wasThisHelpful","R2GT3JTD7SVJO0","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really high quality reading lamp, that we actually use for a low level light when it's bedtime for our 9YO daughter.4 stars because the quality of the construction is excellent, and best of all, the quality of the light is IMO perfect.  Not too bright, not too dim, and color temperature is not the blue tone you get with so many LED reading lights these days (we have several).The clamp, as others have mentioned, is EXTREMELY sturdy, and I'm so glad considering we are putting this on our pre-teen daughter's headboard.  Light hasn't moved since I clamped it there weeks ago.My only minor nit, is that when I clamped the light down on top of the headboard (from the top), the flex in the ""necK"" of the light didn't seem to like being in the position I wanted (cobra like), which I thought was strange considering I assume it was designed for that position.  Probably wouldn't notice this unless you are clamping DOWN on a vertical surface though (like a headboard).I will try a few more positions for the clamp, but even as is, hasn't caused problems, and our daughter loves it.  Especially compared to the previous book clamp lights she had, which constantly fell off, or had battery issues, or just plain stopped working.Highly recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCTEAF625YX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIYJXAQ#wasThisHelpful","RNCTEAF625YX1","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this unit, especially now that I have installed it and it's been in use during some very dry, indoor conditions.When I first opened the box it was packaged in, I thought immediately that it was likely going to be junk, given the poor quality and shoddy packaging (just cheap plastic), and the relatively light weight of the base unit itself.Well, it may be cheap (and I think this is intentional - i.e. a low cost, but high functioning weather unit), but I absolutely love the results to date.I have three kids, some of whom get really dry, stuffy noses in winter.  They all have their own bedrooms upstairs (master BR is down), and we also have a main living area that varies wildly in temperature and humidity due to proximity to the kitchen, doors opening and closing nearby, and a fireplace to boot.The fact that I am able to set a sensor in each room and monitor the humidity levels so easily and quickly is just awesome.  Nothing complicated here, but I think that's the reason I like it.  You simply glance at the large sized numbers and can immediately get a very clear picture of what is going on, temp and humidity-wise, all over the house.I have not had the problem with range that others have mentioned, and we have a very large house, with all three kids bedrooms quite far from the main base unit.I will likely add two more sensors to the three that came with this, just to cover the master bedroom, and the outdoors.  The only disadvantage that I can see that adding units will cause, is that you won't be able to see all units' readings at a glance, since you will have to scroll by pushing a button, to see more than 4 readings at a time.  Not a big deal, and actually if they had made the font size smaller to accommodate additional units, I guarantee you most would complain that the numbers are hard to read due to the small size *they are perfect as is, I can read it from 12+ feet away.The fact that you can calibrate these (given the cost) is amazing to me, and I found the instructions MUCH better than I was expecting on first seeing the unit after unpacking.  Every one of my remote units was within 1% of the rh reading on the existing hygrometer I had, but I am not sure if that is typical or not.Overall, I highly recommend this if you are interested in a very reasonably priced weather unit that was obviously designed for simplicity and cost, but also ""just works"", and works well I might add.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PFP0E5TJDRO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX8ZGOO#wasThisHelpful","R1PFP0E5TJDRO8","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I am pleased with this wine rack, and was pleasantly surprised to note just how many slots it has.On a positive note, the finish of the wood is very nice, a neutral earthy tone, but at least mine is much lighter than what is shown in the picture.  I would call it almost grey-green, but that sounds bad - it really is a pleasant, neutral color.  The wood is also EXTREMELY smooth to the touch, which I was pleasantly surprised by.  They really did a great job of finishing this.I also like the difference in shape to hold the rear part of the bottle vs the front.  I have a wine rack table I bought from Pier One many years ago that has a rack with no differentiation in size between the front and the back, and I have had more than one bottle fall out due to the poor design.Now for the negatives, which are not that big of a deal, and I don't see them having a long term impact on my use or enjoyment.For one, the wood used here is extremely lightweight (probably pine, because of the cost), and thus is susceptible to dings, dents, and in my case, when I was putting it together, pieces around the pre-drilled holes chipping off.  Fortunately, this didn't happen in a spot that is visible after assembly.  Bottom line: don't expect oak here, it's definitely cheap wood, but the finish will hide any dings or dents that will happen I think.Finally, just a nit to pick about the instructions, which I found a bit frustrating.  Primarily because I noticed that the picture in one of the first graphics is wrong (can't remember exactly which step, but it showed one of the pieces as having two dowels, that in reality only had one) which made assembly take a lot longer than it needed to.  OTOH, they did nicely package the hardware in separate bags, and marked by step!  Love this idea, and I wish others would follow suit.Overall, a good to very good wine rack I think, but note that it holds a whopping 56 bottles - if you typically have only a few bottles of wine laying around, and want somewhere to store them, this rack is not for you, as I think less than 10 bottles would look a little silly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKUPB6SQMW41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CETEH54#wasThisHelpful","R3PKUPB6SQMW41","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess I will once again come down on the minority side of a product, and say that I was quite disappointed with this.If it wasn't for my 6YO saying she liked it, I would have given it 2 stars instead of 3 (but I guarantee you she will not ask to play with this again, unprompted).Overall, this seems like a nice package, and they way the box presents it, is really well done, so I think as gift, this would probably be impressive (initially).  The problems I have with it are pretty basic though...the unique ""thing"" about this set is that you can create ""figures"" that stand up, using the included tattoos (ponies, faeries, butterflies, etc).  That's a cool idea, in theory.  In actuality, even my 6 YO could not get a decent transfer onto the dough.  I tried 2 or three, and never got a perfect one, and that was following the directions precisely (and be 10x more careful than a typical 4YO would).As for the other features, pretty standard fare for play-doh type sets...there's a teapot that is used to extrude the dough, but as with every single one of these sets we have used before, clean up after the fact is a real chore (and I should say that my 9YO had trouble extruding...VERY difficult to push down and get the dough to come out with the filter in place).So overall, while this is going to look good on the toy store shelf to your kid, and is going to seem like a great bday present gift when first opened, once you actually start to use it, the luster is lost pretty quickly.Can't recommend this really, when there are so many other, better sets out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHTGW569S5W1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3LV89S#wasThisHelpful","RBHTGW569S5W1","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think it's interesting, and a little disturbing I guess, to see a website like the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) give out ratings to so many companies's products that are claiming non-toxic, gentle, green ingredients, when in fact they are apparently just subbing out traditionally used, toxic ingredients, for new, not as known, ones!I'm no chemist, so I have to rely on such independent sites to get my information.  And while the company's claims of ""no parabens, sulfates, phthalates"" is true, it's ALSO true that it has what some would consider to be a toxic chemical in it (albeit just a trace amount).So for me, considering there ARE now (thankfully) a boatload of similar, health conscious products on the market (and readily available in any Target or grocery store), I will tend towards those instead of this brand.I love the fact that this is fragrance-free, and it feels and smells EXACTLY like the product I have been using for years now, on all three of our kids, which is Johnson and Johnson's version of this (fragrance free, dye free foaming shampoo/soap).  It's good stuff, and I haven't found anything better to date.If I am going to the extra effort and expense of buying so called ""green"" products, then I want them as green, clean and non-toxic as possible.

"This will be my third, and final Moen faucet, I think, at least concerning their low end stuff (assuming they have a higher end line even).First impressions right out of the box are that this is a REALLY cheaply made product.  So much plastic, that I have my doubts about how long this will last.  The current, ""goose neck"" designed Moen we have in our kitchen sink currently is leaking from the spout of the pull out wand head, and there doesn't seem to be any way to get to the parts that likely need replacing to fix it (i.e. if I want to fix it, I guess that means buy a new faucet).One last caveat here, is that the instructions are not clear at all, IMO, and quite frustrating (and this is not my first rodeo when it comes to installing plumbing fixtures, either).To end on a positive note, I was so disappointed with the ""action"" of the button out of the box, that I almost didn't install it.  It felt VERY mushy, and I was hoping that it was only due to it being dry, and that water pressure would make it perk up.  Happy to report that once water is flowing through, the button action is much more precise, and better with tactile feedback than it is when you just take it out of the box and click it on and off, dry.Appearance-wise, this faucet looks ok...for now, but I am quite unimpressed with the amount of plastic used here, and I have the feeling that I will be replacing this one, too, within a few years.  A plumber once told me that you really have to spend $400+ to get a decent kitchen faucet these days, that will last what people expect them to.  I have yet to do that, but getting tired of replacing these, so I guess a $500 that lasts 10 years is better than 3 faucets @ $250+ each during that same time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BLHX4CILVQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IP4PA6#wasThisHelpful","R16BLHX4CILVQ1","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I am a bit of a remote hoarder...I tend to be hard on mine (I also have three young kids), so they wear out quickly in my house, but I also have NEVER found The One (including Harmony One, which I was pretty disappointed in) where I have said ""THIS is the remote I want to live with for the next few years!"".I've used many different setups in the past:1. Separate remotes for everything (cable box, TV, receiver, DVD player, etc)2. A mixture of using the A/V receiver remote for most functions, but this also required using one or two additional remotes (but still fewer total used than 1. above)3. A hard button, universal remote (made by, shocking no one, the ""Universal Remote Control"" company - not kidding) that was highly praised at the time it was out, and is still considered a ""classic"" remote (even though it was a BIG pain to program...no fancy shmancy online or software setup like with the Logitechs today)4. Several Logitech Harmony remotes, ending with the Harmony One, which was generally highly regarded, but I never liked it personally, and mine really only lasted a year or so before the range got really poor, and it began to be very sluggish and slow in general.Having said all that, I LOVE this remote.  It marries the best of both remote worlds...the flexibility and power of a touch screen, with the simplicity and great tactile feedback of a hard button remote.  The only quandary you will be faced with when using this system is ""which is closer, my smart phone, or the ""simple"" Logitech remote?"", OR in some cases, ""what do I need to do?"" (some things the smartphone app is better at/easier doing, and some things the hard button remote is easier).All is not perfect in Peace, Love and Harmony Land, but soooo close, that I had to give five stars because finally, after SO many years of getting remotes wrong (in my dissenting opinion), Logitech has turned it around and is heading in the right direction (again).So many things that switching to this system from the Harmony One ""fixed"", that I wish I had made the switch as soon as this Smart Control system came out.  I really hate gushing in general, but I love doing it when it's warranted.  It's warranted here, IMO.PROS:- DUAL systems to cater to those who prefer touch, and those who prefer buttons.  Use both, or either one!  I think this works extremely well, and I find myself using both on a constant basis (with preference to the hard button remote).- This finally puts to rest any problems you may have had with IR, RF, BT, PS3, IRS, OPP, etc....problems...FINALLY I don't have to use a dongle and separate remote just to turn my PS3 on and off (as I did with the Harmony One).  FINALLY I don't have to worry about range, and pointing the stupid Harmony One RIGHT AT (and close in) the device I am trying to control for it to work.  In fact, I didn't even have to program ANYthing (that may be because I imported settings from Harmony One).  Just SUCH a clean implementation of multi...tech (in terms of the ""beams"" I guess), that I don't even care what device needs to use what tech anymore...because this baby does it all in the background for me!- ALMOST perfectly designed hard button remote.  It's small, so it fits your hand much better than that crazy long previous Harmony remotes, which often required two hands to use (one to hold, one to press the top buttons or touch screen).  It feels like it is very well made, with high quality materials - a nice rubberized matte plastic on the back with good grippiness, and relatively short throw buttons on top, which will hopefully last for years without wearing out.-An app that I was expecting to be horrible based on reviews, but I have nothing but praise as it has worked flawlessly for me so far.  I wonder if the poor reviews are from people who downloaded the app but don't own the correct remote maybe?  Or maybe the poor reviews based on an earlier version of the software?  No idea.CONS:- By far, my biggest complaint with this system (really, my ONLY complaint), is that the hard button remote does not have backlit buttons.  To me personally, that is a HUGE flaw on any remote, considering that I like to watch TV/movies in the dark, and when you have a bright screen in front of you, the resulting backlight effect is pretty darn strong, making reading tiny letters really hard (and I have better than 20/20 vision, so it's not that).  But due to the pure awesome sauce that is this system, I will gladly overlook that inconvenience to get all the other goodies it provides.  For now, at least.  If they don't add backlit keys to version 2, I will be pissed.- I guess the only other nit I would pick, is that SOMEtimes, when I pick up my phone to use as the remote, the app will have to ""RECONNECT"" with the hub, and that takes a second (and the time it takes to connect varies, interestingly), but to date it has not been that big of a deal, just something to consider for someone planning to only use their iPhone as control...One last thing to add...I sit about 10' away from the devices I need to control, all of which are in a cabinet, which is pretty much blocked (line of sight) by a coffee table.  The cabinet has opaque frosted glass doors (devices are behind those doors), which are almost always closed.  Even with all that, my system works perfectly, and I didn't even set it up the optimal way, according to directions, nor did I even use the extra dongle they give you to boost the signal INSIDE cabinets, as suggested.  In my excitement to try out the new remote, I just set the main hub on top of the entertainment center, and it has worked great that way - no problems at all with it ""talking"" to any of my devices that are enclosed.Obviously, I like this.  I ""lahkit alaht"" (Dumb and Dumber).  Even if you have been turned off by Logitech's recent offerings in remotes (like me), I highly recommend you give them one more shot.  Primarily, because they so dominated the remote control market for so many years, that it forced most other makers to quit, or go to the high end installer markets (i.e. there's not a whole lot out there any more to choose from).  If you have run into range or line of sight problems, TRY this.  If you are disgusted with the ugly, insanely long and horribly designed two-hander Harmony remotes, TRY this.My only hope is that the next version implements backlit buttons on the hard remote, and maybe, possibly adds a power cradle, but after years of dealing with those, I am not sure I don't like this return to simplicity much better (the hard button remote just uses batteries, nothing internal to charge).EASY 5 stars here, and major kudos to Logitech for turning their Harmony series around, from imminent doom, to a shining beacon of...radio frequency/BT/wifi...light..?  :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2925FDD19HN3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ5RYI4#wasThisHelpful","R2925FDD19HN3G","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't do this much when reviewing an item, but this vac is so bad, I would give it no stars if that was possible.  Even if I didn't compare it to the Roomba that it's trying to copy, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, for any situation.I'm not even going to go into all the reasons this is junk, because the top three should be sufficient enough to warn anyone that thinks they will be saving money by getting this over a Roomba.  Trust me, you are better off with a broom and dustpan than this.The only positive thing I can say about this is that it's relatively inexpensive and that the idea of the cleaning cloths is great (I wish the Roomba's did this).As a vac though, this ""Super Maid"" fails on all levels...in most cases creating more mess than was there in the first place due to an incredibly small bin, very little suction, but maybe most important, the fact that ANY little non flat surface completely stumps this unit, and it's not smart enough like Roomba, to know that it's stuck, so will stay there infinitely I guess, until it runs out of batts, just spinning its wheels, and throwing debris everywhere.  Lovely.Also, since there is no way to block off certain areas (like with beacons), it will try to go everywhere, and it's just not made for that.Bottom line is that you will end up having to monitor this constantly while its in use, which really defeats the purpose of these, no?  And not only that, the actual vacuum function is horrible.  Roomba is bad, but this is much worse.  On top of that, it falsely (almost laughable actually) claims to pick up NAILS on the box, and other heavy objects!Just a flat out lie, as it even has trouble with Cheerios in my experience.I could go on, but I won't.

"I have more than a few Mr. Beams' items in my house (ceiling light in shed, multiple stair/step lights for both inside and out), and have been pleased with all of them.The fit and finish on this light is excellent, and has much more of a quality feel to it than my other items.  Soft touch rubber in appropriate places, hard (but not cheap feeling) plastics in others.  Really nice, sturdy unit.My biggest complaint is related to the fact that this requires big, heavy D batteries, which A. is unusual these days, so most people probably don't have a lot of use for this size battery in many items, and B. 4 D batteries add relatively quite a bit of weight if you are taking this hiking or camping.I think I would have preferred that the unit used C's, or give the option for a rechargeable unit (instead of, or in addition to the battery option).Otherwise, the 2 level light is brilliant. and the weather sealing and proofing is quite evident.Highly recommend if you don't consider the D battery requirement to be too inconvenient.

"I've bought cheap, $200+ swing sets from some of the typical manufacturers, and I got about 2 years out of the last one.  This one is so much better in every single way, except one:  we are missing the most fun swing accessory of all (that we had on a previous Flexible Flyer model) - the awesome yard swing!  If it had this, or at least the option to add this, it would be even better than it already is.No parts missing, delivery of crate was uneventful.  The quality of this has to be seen and felt to be believed.  I'm 5'10"" and about 190, and I can swing, slide and hang on every part of this thing it's so sturdy (and the thing doesn't move even when I'm on it with my kids!).  No concrete or supports needed at all.My only gripes, other than the lack of options to fit other kind of swing accessories:1.  the plastic covering for the swing chains (where you hold the swing) is now extremely tacky after our first summer, and I guess due to the summer heat.  Considering this set is marketed for high temps, I was a bit disappointed in that.2. It's not going to burn you, but again, they market the coating to be specifically designed to not get so hot in the sun...which is not really the case (at least where I live).  It definitely does get too hot to the touch unless you have some kind of covering or shade.  I guess it could be worse (pure, uncoated metal), but the reality doesn't live up to the marketing for this feature.But those are relatively minor gripes...I have 3 kids, aged 3 through 9, and they all love this.  Can't recommend enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8D56FES45CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089NNI5O#wasThisHelpful","R3B8D56FES45CY","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third Oral-B electric toothbrush we have had in the past 13 years or so, and I am impressed that they just seem to get better with every generation (that we try at least - apparently they have hundreds of different models out there!).I hesitate to give 4 stars here, only because I feel that the ""extras"" included with this high end model are almost ridiculous, compared to the other less costly models.  However, the toothbrush itself, in its basic function of cleaning your teeth, is fantastic, and noticeably better than the previous generations I used.Reasons this gets 4 stars:- spectacular brushing power, action, and results that you can feel (especially if you have not used a good, or modern electric toothbrush)- battery life is crazy good now, you could easily take this on a 2-3 day trip (more?) with no charger- I like the new design for the brush holders.  Our previous model held the brushes in a very confined, vertical compartment, which I felt did not let them air out at all.  This new layout is much better IMO (though takes up more space).- Very small nitpicky thing, but finally I only have to push the button ONCE to stop the brush - on the previous model, you had to push the button 2x for some reason (first world probs!)Reasons for my considering giving three stars:- this particular model is an obvious attempt to cash out on what is at its base model, a great product.  If you look at the comparison chart on the Oral B site, the higher model features, IMO, do not add any value at all, and seem to simply be feature bloat justification to charge more money.- the ""travel"" case has become ridiculous  - WAY too big and heavy for any serious traveler.  My mother, who packs three suitcases for a 3 day trip, would think this case is awesome.  A real traveler would not consider ever packing this monster.  Yes, it's nice, yes it's quality and well-made, but very anti-travel.So overall, very easy to recommend this, but I would certainly also recommend checking out the Oral B site and looking at all their offerings in this line to see if you really want the extra features that they have added on this model.For me personally, I could care less about the wireless linking between my toothbrush and a digital face that either scorns or praises you, depending on how it thinks your brushing session went.  Judgmental little bastard!  I also don't brush based on zones, or time, or anything, except experience of having done the task for the past 30 plus years.  I don't need a trumped up emoticon to guide me how to do something I've successfully done for so many years (and apparently my teeth are in great shape, according to my dentist)!  :DBottom line is that this toothbrush to me represents the pinnacle of electric toothbrushes, and I believe so strongly in the power of these to clean your teeth better than using a traditional/manual toothbrush, that I have ""electric toothbrush"" on my family gift list, for all those who don't yet have one.  They really are superior cleaners, and while this particular model is probably a little over the top in terms of features you don't need, at its core, it's a great tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268T7E59315HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ8PR1U#wasThisHelpful","R268T7E59315HX","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a few other toys from this company, including the sea plane and the tug boat, both of which are used quite often in both the pool and the bath tub.Compared to those, I would put this rocket slightly ahead in terms of enjoyment factor for our 3 YO, primarily because it's a little more interactive, with two astronauts and a detachable module.I'm personally less interested in the green aspect of these toys (although it's a factor), than I am the idea that in play, sometimes ""less is more"", which seems to be lost on the current generation of teens and younger.  Specifically, the toys this company makes are great BECAUSE they fly in the face of most modern toys:- they don't have electronics or run on batteries,- they don't make noise or have stickers- they aren't packaged in ridiculously gaudy boxes with Fort Knox level security ties.Is it too minimalist?  I personally don't think so, and in fact I think kids NEED these kinds of ""slow"" toys these days in the face of Playstations, iPad minis, and robotic animals.  Just good fuel for the imagination, not to mention these will seemingly last forever, they are so sturdily and simply made.Really enjoy everything we have from this company, and looking forward to more offerings (although they already have a pretty extensive catalog).Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66Y03EHO5TDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPRLGVE#wasThisHelpful","R66Y03EHO5TDE","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having three children, ages 3 to 9, I find it difficult to play board games these days that include that wide of a range.  On the rare occasions that one or two of the kids are separated, and especially if the youngest is absent or napping, it's much easier, but still a challenge to find something that engages a 3 year+ spread.Many times, if I want to play something that all three can play, we have to go lowest common denominator, and end up with the most simple games, like Candyland (UGH), or simple match games, etc.Recently though, I had the rare treat of being able to break this out and play one on one with my nine year old, which arguably is probably slightly above the recommended ""most fun for this age"" group.I've played TONS of board games over the years, not to mention all the ones from my childhood, and frankly, I have to say this one gets a mere ""meh"" from me.  If I could, I would give it precisely 3.5 stars, somewhere between ""It's OK"" and ""I like it"", but probably comes down closer to the ""It's OK"" side.I'm not really down on the game, but it's basically yet another matching game (and it admits as much on the box), with some polish thrown in (BIG die, big, colorful cards, big art on the playing board) to make it seem more exciting.I think kids old enough to play this will see through the fact that it's just not that fun (unless they have never played a matching game before), and will quickly be bored.  I noted that my eldest daughter immediately picked up the accompanying book and started to read that, which to her was more interesting than the game play itself.  :DI'm probably not as down on this as my review comes across, but with so many high quality board games out there for kids in this age range (readers, basically), there is no need to settle for merely an OK game.  Plenty that are much more creative, much more stimulating, and just more fun.In its defense, and going back to my original point, I did successfully play this with all three children, with the 3YO playing together with me.  He was happy to play ""the big kid's game"", even if I did most of the decision making.  So kudos for making a game that can be played across a broad age range, but again, ultimately, for good readers, I would recommend other, more original and stimulating games before this one.EDIT after playing a few more times:  I actually like this a little better now, that I have played more than once with the two older kids.  I also notice them playing it by themselves on occasion.  Solid 4 stars.  Just a side note...I noticed the 6YO in tears once when the older kid made her give her one of her cards that she liked.  She's a bit immature for her age, so that is more a testament about my kid's inability to deal with...""strife"" than it is with the game I guess.  But just note this is not a ""yay! everybody wins!"" kind of game (thankfully), since there are times when things/cards are taken from you, and you can also ""punish"" others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ODTV2HM5K3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W281XA#wasThisHelpful","R34ODTV2HM5K3Y","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"See update below after 2 yrs of useFirst: Contrary to popular belief, a 5 star rating does not indicate ""perfect"" in Amazon's system, but ""I love it"".  (4 stars = I like it FWIW)I have three kids, aged 3, 6 and 9, so I have a garage full of child sized vehicles - from scooters, to trikes, to big wheels, to regular bikes.  I also have three ride-ons that use the same action as this Radio Flyer.  Needless to say, I am VERY familiar with ride on toys...from researching and buying, to assembling and repairing.If you are in the market for a ride-on that uses ""plasma car"" action (back and forth motion to move the vehicle), this one is highly recommended, and a great value at current asking prices on Amazon.  Since I own what I guess are the three most well known ride-ons that use this action, I'll give you a quick comparison based on my experience:The original Plasma Car:  currently selling for about the same price as this Ziggle on Amazon.  While we owe this model our gratitude and respect for bringing the concept about (I think), it's been FAR surpassed by the other two I own, in just about every category except price (and only a few dollars difference from Ziggle at the time of this review).  PASS.  All plastic, LOUD, not smooth at all, and most importantly, it's very difficult to go fast so many kids end up just using their feet on the ground to self propel.  Cool shape?  Yes!  Great, original  idea?  Also yes!  But again, I would not recommend this to anyone with so many other better alternatives in the market.  Also, the travel of the front wheels is so restricted, relative to the other two below, that you have to ""twist"" twice as fast or more, to get up to the same speed (which in most cases is not even possible).EZY Roller:  This gets FULL 5 stars from 130+ Amazon reviewers for a reason:  it IS all that, and IMO, sits at the top of the plasma ride-on food chain.  This is the mack daddy, but also costs exactly twice as much as the Ziggle.  What that extra $$ gets you is:  more age flexibility (even adults can ride the EZY, with an included extension), a hand brake, a lower to the ground profile, and I think EVER SO SLIGHT of an edge in terms of speed (compared to the Ziggle).  Also HIGHLY recommended.  Get this if you plan to use with older kids, or on hills (since it has a lower center of gravity).Radio Flyer Ziggle:  The reason I am so impressed with this model, is that the build quality is SO good (as good or better than the EZY), yet costs half as much!  I watched my 6 YO test out the EZY and the Ziggle back to back, and finally asked her if she could only choose ONE, what would it be, she chose the Ziggle, I think because she liked the way it turned, and that she felt the handlebars gave her a little more control (EZY only has foot control).  Both of these will zoom though, so I would not even consider that in the equation.I guess my only concern is that they used foam (it is dense, but still) for the hand grips, and I can tell you from experience that that material will likely not last more than a season.  We will see though...maybe I'm wrong.Editing to add after many days of play:  Unless you have one kid, or one ride-on per kid, the seat adjustment on this is a big pain, with 4 bolts and nuts that need to be unscrewed and screwed again each time you adjust the seat.  There are plenty of better ways to do this (ask me how I know), so it's too bad they chose not to use a much faster release mechanism for the seat.  Since I have 3 multi-sized kids, and if I were Dad of the Year (I'm not, therefore I didn't), I would have to remove and re-attach the seat for each kid since they are such different sizes.  The middle kid and the fun-sized kid could probably share a setting, but it wouldn't be comfortable.I should also note that adjusting for length on the Ezy Roller is just as tedious (even more so, maybe, considering you have to use extension pieces that are separate).  Not a huge knock for either ride-on, just a wish list item for a Dad that is basically the riding toy mechanic for three kids, and the neighbor kids as well.So in summary, an easy 5 stars here (4.5 if I could), and kudos to Radio Flyer for putting out such a high quality toy at this price point!  We have a couple other of their outdoor wheeled vehicles (a wagon, and a trike), and this one by far has the best quality feel to it.Edited to add comments after a year of use (10/20/14):  Still going strong after a year, and much usage by our 3 kids, plus plenty of neighborhood kids.  Definitely stand by my 5 star rating...this little 4 wheeler is still smooth as butter, and often preferred over other available ""garage vehicles"".  :P  It's probably been left out in the rain a couple times at least, and definitely kids too big for it have ridden it, but shows no sign of wear at all.  Again, it's obvious this thing is VERY well made.UPDATE (11/10/15):  Still in top shape after MUCH use for the past couple years.  This has also come to be the most coveted ""vehicle"" in our garage.  It's just such a great ride on, and as the kids have gotten older, I notice them doing tricks on it that I never knew were possible before....basically drifting at high speeds....so fun...I wish I could ride it!  :D  Can't heap enough praise on both the design and durability of this great toy.  Well done, RF, well done!!  Maybe the best, most fun ride on out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16QAK6MBW3QDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXVNXEO#wasThisHelpful","R16QAK6MBW3QDJ","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having reviewed the outstanding, but slightly spendy RAB outdoor motion lights, and going through way too many cheap, big box home store offerings that die after a year or two, I am happy to say that this light appears to strike a great balance between quality and price.  I was wondering why there wasn't any competition in this space, but here comes a company I had never heard of, with several offerings in the sector recently.I notice that the price has increased quite a bit for these since I first saw them on Amazon, so not sure if that trend will continue or not.  If it does, I recommend you price compare against the similar RAB offerings.PROS:- easy to install- no bulbs!  LED ""dots"" put out an amazing amount of light for what they are.  I would definitely recommend this kind of light in an area where you might have concerns about breakage (balls hitting it, etc)- cost, relative to other pure LED offerings, is nice, but again, check against RAB before buying IMO, as their stuff is obviously better made, but can be expensive (and you will have to buy bulbs, which if you get LED outdoor floods, can be about $30 EACH).-Sensor seems to work great- Energy efficient - just crazy how efficient these little LED ""nibs"" are!  For anyone leaving a security light on all night, or one that gets ""tripped"" by motion frequently, cannot recommend enough that you switch to LED immediately.CONS:- aesthetically, just as boring and rather ugly as all the other stuff you typically see at the big box stores.  Nothing new here, same old design,- pricing is variable - as of this writing, only about $20 less than the better made, better looking RAB models (but again, note RAB does not come with bulbs, which the All Pro doesn't need)- no 50% power mode - this is one of my very favorite features of many motion detector lights, and even many of the crummy lights at Lowe's have this (sometimes called ""Dual Brite"" mode).  Not a deal breaker at all, more like ""I miss this on the lights I have that don't have this feature"".- color - this is probably my biggest beef with the light, but also very much a personal preference.  The light temperature on these is very much in the ""cold, blue"" variety, which is unappealing to me, at least for residential use.  Fine for businesses, but I personally like the warmer temps for house use (that goes for inside as well).  The too white, almost blue cast, feels very clinical.  Again, YMMV, since some prefer this color.Overall, I have to give this 4 stars for cost, energy efficiency of the LED's, and NO BULB!  What remains to be seen, and what fails so quickly on most consumer motion detectors, are the crummy sensors.  I am hoping the one included with this unit will last for years (and if not, I will come back here and update the review of course).UPDATE 10/17/14:  one year later, still working, no problems at all.  The bluish color of the light is very annoying though, but as mentioned before, that is a personal preference more than a design flaw.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8S2DLDTZMS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJPMBUU#wasThisHelpful","R1A8S2DLDTZMS8","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to try this since I have three kids, and many times they will run to open the door whenever the doorbell rings, which drives me nuts.We also use an older VTech answering system for our home phone which is connected to an Ooma VOIP system.  I have replaced the batteries twice in the older Vtech now 2x, and still will not hold a charge in the hand held units, so it was time to upgrade.On first impression, this phone looks sleek and modern compared to my older Vtechs, albeit a bit large and gangly (tall).  Unfortunately, right out of the gate, I was disappointed to note that these very tall units do not stand up vertically on their own very well compared to my older, wider units.  And considering that that's exactly the position you want these to be in so you can view the screen, that already is a pretty big strike in my book.  They WILL stand up on their own, but barely, and are prone to fall over/get knocked over.On the plus side, the button push action is nice, and the buttons themselves are well done...highly polished, nice feel.  The construction of the entire thing feels fine as well - not perfect, but very good.Since we only use our house phone for international calls, and very occasionally for someone that still has our old landline number, I won't focus much on the call quality aspects, or the telephony aspects, as these seem pretty standard to me in terms of performance (and I think most of my call quality is dependent on my Ooma bandwidth/signal more than the phone hardware).  Answering machines seems to work fine, and the voice is clear and easy to understand.But the main reason for this unit is its video/doorbell capability, and in that, as noted by others, it fails miserably.  GREAT idea...I want so much for this product to work, but really poor execution and I cannot recommend in this stage.  Hopefully VTech will go back immediately and release a V2 of this and fix the two major problems that so many others here are complaining about (which I echo): 1. video quality, even in decent light, is extremely poor for this day and age, to the point that it is difficult to make out who is at the door, and 2. if there is any backlight when someone rings the bell (a common occurrence apparently, as it is at my front porch as well), you can forget being able to see who is there.I would also like to add that again, given the modern day audio compression capabilities, as well as modern digital storage capabilities, there should be a LOT more doorbell chimes than the ones available here.  Better still, charge $10 more and let the user make their own!  Just an idea, and I guess most people don't mind the chimes included, but they could have done a lot more in terms of the flexibility with the door chime tones here.In summary, pass on this model until they update the video tech inside (and please either weight the base or change the format of the hand units so they can stand up on their own!)","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8EQCRUV7DRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLVLHLI#wasThisHelpful","RS8EQCRUV7DRK","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Literally the first time I used these shears on a small jasmine vine, one of the rivets that holds the blades together, popped out, never to be found again in the mess that is my mix of tall grass and mulch.  I tried to repair them, but noting I didn't have the right sized nuts and bolts, decided this was not one of those instances where I will just shrug off an inferior product, that I end up fixing myself (especially after the FIRST use!).So I sent a pic into Fiskars (online return/warranty system is very nice and easy FWIW), showing the problem.  I received no feedback for weeks (by this time, my jasmine vine was out of control of course), then one day received a box with a set of their lowest quality shears inside.  Not extendable, and they look like the cheapest shears I have ever seen.  I doubt they will last a season, with the obviously cheap plastic they used for the handles.Talk about a slap in the face.  My time is worth more than dealing with that kind of stuff, and I wish they would just lower their prices and forego the ""lifetime warranty!"" deal if that is how they roll.  I would never have purchased the shears they sent me, so basically I should have just bought another set (NOT Fiskars obviously) of shears when the originals broke.  Ah well, you live you learn.  Buyer beware on these, I see at least three other instances of this same problem happening in these reviews.UPDATE: To be fair, and as a credit to the company's customer service, I actually did contact them later to let them know that I wasn't happy about the switcheroo.  They promptly sent a replacement for the exact shears I originally bought.  Kudos for that!  Hopefully this pair will not fall apart when I start to use them.UPDATE to UPDATE :)  The replacement extendable shears also fell apart (in the exact same manner as the originals) after using them about 4x.  Wow.  That is some seriously shoddy manufacturing.  Either that, or I am The Hulk and didn't know it.  Perhaps I have superhuman strength which simply overpowers mere iron and steel.

"Great lock, great brandMoved into a new house in January, with an assortment of different brand locks, different types, and styles from the previous owners, so I decided to do some research since I thought it best to just replace all (for looks, security and ease).  I decided on buying Schlage, from everything I had read, and I have not been disappointed at all.  Yes, the brand is pricey, but IMO, well worth the extra cost.This touchscreen deadbolt has proven to be no exception, and is a good step up from the Schlage BE365 that has the keypad with rubberized buttons (which I also own and have used for 6 months or so).  It's very much worth the extra money ($50 at the time of this review) since this is something you will use every day.Several reasons I prefer this model over the BE365 with the hard buttons:1. The BE365 lock manual notes that you should change the code on the lock every few months so you don't cause the buttons to wear down unevenly (thus giving visual clues as to what your code might be).  This upgraded model hopefully prevents that by using a completely flat touch screen surface that does not show fingerprints (it has a nice, matte, sturdy feel to it).2. This model auto locks after 30 seconds if you turn this feature on, something I turned on immediately since I have sometimes left the house, forgetting to lock the door using the BE365.  This feature alone would have been worth the extra cost to me.  Someone else mentioned that the lock unfortunately does this with the door both open and close, so you do have to be careful if you are talking to someone with the door open, so you don't bang up your frame.3.  Aesthetically more pleasing, IMO. Has a more modern look, and looks and feels much more substantial, if that has any bearing at all.  Dunno what the psychological impact of a wimpy looking lock vs. this industrial strength, Robocop looking one has on potential burglars, but I would imagine it might have some small effect.4.  Tamper technology:  this lock incorporates a built in alarm feature which I really like and have on another Schlage unit that is just a standard door handle, going to the garage.  Works very well, and I love the fact that you can adjust the sensitivity based on how paranoid you are!  :D  I have mine set to the ""only sound the alarm when someone tries to kick the door in"" level, otherwise, I find it too sensitive, and going off during times I didn't want it to.  If you don't already have an alarm system, the door chime is a nice bonus as well.5.  Increase digits for the code.  On the BE365, you are limited to a 4 digit code, but this lock allows you to input more (up to 8).  In theory, the 4 digit code should be enough to keep even the most foolish (or drug addled) burglar busy for hours, but adding even one more digit just makes me feel better, and decreases the odds exponentially, of someone guessing the code.6.  You don't have to use two hands.  On the BE365, after putting in the code on the keypad, you have to manually turn the deadbolt, and assuming you also have a door handle, have to push that as well.  Yeah yeah yeah, first world problems, but if you have your hands full, this extra little touch is a NICE thing to have!  One less thing to have to fumble with to get in your house is great IMO.7. ANSI 1 rated lock, compared to ANSI 2 of the BE365.  No idea what that actually means in the real world, outside of some certification, but supposedly you are getting a more secure lock, the lower the number.Can't comment on the Nexia/Z Wave features as I have no interest in remotely controlling my lock.So overall, a highly recommended upgrade.  I have installed and uninstalled MANY Schlage handle and locks since we moved in, from the simple handles, to handles with alarms built in, deadbolts, and finally this one.  They were all a pleasure to install due to the quality of the materials included (LONG bolts that go into your frame, instead of the short puny ones you get with lesser locks).  I personally found the installation on all of mine to go as smoothly as possible as it can when installing door hardware (which is often fraught with unforeseen hiccups due to warping, fit, hole precision, etc).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZWV4MS6S9MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGK9KJQ#wasThisHelpful","R22ZWV4MS6S9MX","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this unit, even though mine arrived with a gasket (around the inside of the enclosure that makes it waterproof) with a small hole in it.  Certainly enough to have let water in, and I am glad I happened to notice before I chunked this into my pool to test it out.  Added a bit of silicon in the hole, and no problem now.Love the look, love the feel, seems like a quality built product, and I even like the sound.  I would have preferred AirPlay in addition to or instead of Bluetooth, since it's less compressed, but for my intentions (poolside), it's fine, in terms of sound quality.The reason this only gets three stars (""It's ok""), is because as other reviewers mention, it has NO playback buttons - only an on/off button, and a volume control!  WTH.Since I use this by the pool, the idea was for me to have this speaker at the edge of the pool while we swim.  But now let's say I am listening to a playlist, and a song I hate comes up (or one of my guilty pleasure, filthy rap songs), I have to get out of the pool, dripping wet, get my phone, and click (again, wet).  Booo!  Completely defeats the purpose and flexibility for me at least, of its waterproof-ness and should really have been included in a unit at this price point.I have more than 3 different portable speakers like this, from different brands, and all of them contain the VERY basic functionality of being able to PLAY, FWD, STOP or REVERSE.  In fact, it's such a basic thing, I just assumed this unit had it when I ordered it.  I certainly would not have had I known.But if you can get past that pretty big limitation, or that limitation doesn't affect the way you would be using this, then I can still highly recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZDYOK347MHLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D91G38#wasThisHelpful","R1ZDYOK347MHLN","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used one of these for some outdoor deck steps down, and it was perfect - until it stopped working (due to water in the unit) within a couple of months.There is absolutely NO weather proofing on these, so I can't understand how they can claim it's an outdoor light?  Not even a seal/gasket around the battery compartment, which would be necessary if you don't water to get in (which it did in mine, as well as the two detectors.  You can see visible droplets in both the motion and light sensors, not to mention the wet batteries).Also, the metal connections for the batteries are awful on mine...very poorly made, to where I had to really fight to get the batteries in, with all three connecting to the terminals.Skip this unless you are only using indoors IMO.

"These are great chairs, if you never take them outside, or let them get wet.Both of the ones I ordered rusted within three weeks (see pic posted in customer images), so I sent one back for a refund, and kept one.The reason I kept one is because I really do love the chairs, from the color, which is unique, and a perfect match for pool water, to the comfort, which is amazing.  REALLY comfortable, and I personally had no problems with the locking mechanism (it IS very cheap plastic, though, so I doubt it will last more than a couple years if that).BUT, the rust...big problem.  Obviously they didn't coat the hardware (screws and such), as these rust first.  Next the metal to metal contact areas of the chair rusted (they just spray the powder coating on, so this is just a poor spray job, since it IS possible to get this right).  This is a major problem since this is all along the frame, and immediately visible.Based on recent reviews vs. first reviews, I also believe Strathwood either changed manufacturers mid production, or the manufacturer themselves changed the process, or machinery...because the more recent reviews complain about rust quite often, but older reviews do not (and some of those even state they have left outdoors no problems).","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CVUDL7907Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W8VCXY#wasThisHelpful","R4CVUDL7907Q","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First: the good.As most have commented, this is truly a thing of beauty.  In terms of looks, simplehuman has probably just achieved the pinnacle of trash can beauty with this unit - it is SO aesthetically pleasing.  From the way the metal is bent, to the fit and finish at the seams, etc. , just top notch all around.  It just screams ""quality!"" (as it should, for the crazy price they are asking).  It's the Porsche 911 of trash cans.Having said that, I used this for a week or two, and found that in terms of practicality, it's inferior to my uglier, older stainless steel, foot pedal trash can (not simplehuman, another brand I can't remember), which I have now reverted back to using.I wanted so badly to like and keep this one, I really did.  The stainless steel used on this unit shows almost NO fingerprints compared to mine, which shows everything.  This unit also hides the bag completely, and with mine, you can see the bag stuck in between the top and the main body....ugly.So why in the world would I not use this new, svelte, knockout?Two reasons, but the biggest by far is that the open/close mechanism is IMO, inferior in daily use, to the foot pedal.  I get the impression from all the marketing and instructional material, that simplehuman wants people to just ""brush up against"" this to open, but this is quite awkward compared to simply stepping on a pedal.  Half the time I tried to open this way, it wouldn't, which is frustrating.  But worse, after just a week or so of use, the lid stopped closing consistently, or rather stopped STAYING closed.  I push it down, it pops back up.  Push down, pops up.  Ugh.  No thanks.  Like so many things of excessive beauty, they often have an Achilles heel of practicality, and it's the case here as well unfortunately.  But even hand opening is a pain when you have your hands full of dishes or what not.The second, more minor reason I stopped using this is the facing of the trash can, but this is highly personalized as to how your trash can ""space"" is set up, and if your space requires a narrower trash can.  Most of our trash cans for the kitchen have been in the same shape as this unit, but open on the narrow side, as opposed to the wide side, as this one does.  Opening on the short side allows you to put the trash can in more narrow spots if necessary, so in terms of fitting somewhere, the decision to have the can open on the wide side restricts the flexibility quite a bit (and especially since this a LARGE trash can).Ms. Trashcan Universe now lives in the garage, where every once in a while, I will peek in to sadly gaze on the tall, slender beauty, stoically accepting her fate of being relegated to ""back up trash can"" status.If simplehuman would make a trash can with this same care, design, and quality, but using a foot pedal instead, it would no doubt be 5 star material (but do get that insane price down a little!).","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPFH05XCVYUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081HFD88#wasThisHelpful","RAPFH05XCVYUU","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the express purpose of piling on to the already great reviews here, let me just reiterate that the quality of this unit is outstanding, and will likely be the last brand of security lighting you buy.I am back here buying my third one of these (already installed two others) just because I am so pleased with the attention to quality and even aesthetics by this manufacturer.  Looking at their other lines (one or two products of which I am considering as well), you can tell this company cares about quality.Go to either of the big box home improvement stores, seek out the most expensive motion detector light they have (50% more expensive than this unit), and it is absolute rubbish.  Ask me how I know.  I have gone through more motion detectors, and their sensors, than I care to admit, but let's just say a lot.As soon as I unpacked the first one of these I bought, I was blown away by the quality of the metal, and surprisingly, the beauty of the thing.  REALLY nice aesthetics, very polished, smooth metal with no rough edges.  A sign to me that the company gives a $$$ about what they do.Yes, you can buy motion detector lights for MUCH less.  And you will be replacing those lights over and over, or at least the crummy sensors they have, which must be designed to fail based on my experiences at least.Unfortunately, the company's web site is terrible in terms of interface and layout, and trying to find certain products, or finding the right products for certain needs - very confusing IMO.  So much so that I ended up calling and speaking with a very helpful rep who steered me in the right direction (either that or the live chat, can't remember which)I hate to gush in general, but when a company's products impress me this much, ESPECIALLY in a sector that is filled with frustration-inducing junk, I take the time to congratulate and share with others who might be in the same position I was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUEKY1I7V9N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W3YI26#wasThisHelpful","R1FUEKY1I7V9N4","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some of this review is copied from another review I wrote for the smaller, round holder made by the same manufacturer (product is similar, just different format/size).I recently moved, and none of the flower pot holders I was using at the old house would work on the narrow fences and wide railings at the new one, and they were also not adjustable, so I thought I was out of luck.Came across this, and it works great!Construction seems to be very good as well, with better than average quality screws/bolts (with appropriate weather protection), which is a rare thing these days, even on higher end stuff sometimes. Amazing how using cheap hardware (screws, bolts, washers, etc) can ruin an otherwise fine product.Anyhoo, I use this specifically to sit on a PVC deck railing, that is much wider than normal.  Not only does this holder allow you to adjust to fit on different sized railings (width), but it also adjusts length wise to accommodate long or short flower pots.  Awesome!This also has a mechanism, which prevents the holder from tilting forward or backward (a problem I had with previous holders)....which is really just a piece of bent metal. Such a simple thing, but it makes a big difference! It even prompted me to look at my other, older holders, to see if they had something to keep the holder level, but nope (and of course they would tend to tilt forward).One other small detail about the attention to quality by the manufacturer. You usually see products like this (especially if you go to a large big box hardware store) try to get away with as few bolts/nails/screws as possible, but this unit has THREE bolts for each ""arm"" (6 total), which may be overkill, but I for one was happy to see that compared to the one that you would normally see (or none at all, like the one I had before - just relied on gravity).Top product, highly recommended. Now that I see that these are good quality, I plan to buy more for the deck to match the one I currently have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XXXK6RFQ8F3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NKYWJA#wasThisHelpful","R1XXXK6RFQ8F3Y","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDITED 5/7/13:  Added a star, changed title.  After using this wine bucket several times now, I decided to go back and add a star.  Primarily because while it is slightly small (just needs to be a LITTLE bit wider to accomodate more ice), there is still enough room to put some ice in the bottom of the unit, and even on the sides, if you are not using an oversized bottle.  But mainly, because I have noticed that this really does keep the wine cool more than I initially thought, and interestingly, out of all my ""wine cooler"" options at home mentioned below, I notice myself grabbing this one every time now.  One thing I didn't mention in the original review is the fit and finish of this, which is top notch.  It's a very small thing, but the transition seam from metal to the plastic part is impeccable...and the feel of this when you place it on a table or counter is VERY nice...hard to describe in words, but a lot of the draw of this is the aesthetics, and that definitely includes the touch, feel, etc. which I think is why I have started using this more.****This is a nice, good-looking, small wine bottle holder that has a few characteristics that keep me from giving it more stars.I notice first of all, that Oxo has changed the product name on Amazon to OXO Steel Wine Sleeve, from OXO Steel Wine Chiller.  Good on ya, marketing, as that is a lot more accurate than the original name.As mentioned in tons of other reviews here, this is more of a temperature...maintainer, or at least increases the amount of time that it takes your bottle to reach room temps.Not a chiller AT ALL.  Still, I have found a use for it in my wine drinking, in situations that I know a bottle will not sit long at the table (if we have a lot of people drinking for instance), or if I just want to use it for a red wine that was slightly chilled to begin with.  Cases I would NOT use this would  be if it's just me and the wife drinking a bottle, and we happen to be drinking a white wine.For reference, if I do want to keep something chilled, I use one of two items that work pretty well:1. An ""icicle"" with cork at the big end.  This thing is awesome...you keep it in the freezer until you're ready to use it, so the plastic ""cicle"" is frozen solid, then when you open your wine, and after serving the first round, you just put the icecicle in the bottle, and cork it back.  Ingenious product that I can't praise enough.2. A wrap around sleeve that also is kept in the freezer (and has pockets of liquid that freezes).  This one is not as user friendly, since it tends to make the bottle hard to hold and pour (unless you remove the bottle), and also makes a mess with condensation everywhere.  Also UGLY. Of all the three ""wine cooling"" devices I have though, it's the most effective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPZUOH0ONBYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6LUAQG#wasThisHelpful","R3RPZUOH0ONBYJ","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not impressed with this latest craft toy we have tried, out of many, from the ALEX company.Their toy line trends to the ""minimalist/crafty"" side, but this is a little too far in that direction, IMO, which results in a boring toy/activity.The others from ALEX we have tried, include some big craft kit/box, which was awesome.  Tons of variety, and just a great activity for a rainy day with your kid or kids.  We also use at least two of their expandable art folders, which are great, and finally we tried a kit with crumpled paper that you make into pictures.  Pretty great, hands on stuff for our age kids (3/6/9).I cannot recommend this one though, because 1. the bits for the automatic screwdriver don't stay on, which causes great frustration (to parent and kid).  But more importantly perhaps is 2. it's just not any fun.  There a PLENTY of great ""drilling"" toys/kits out there that I would recommend, like pretty much anything from Battat, for instance.Sorry, ALEX, you make some good, to very good kits, but this isn't one of them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN35124ETW14J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LL2G92#wasThisHelpful","RN35124ETW14J","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 7/29/13:  Just a quick note after several months of use.  Amazed at how much run time I get on one battery!  I can do my entire 1/2 acre property which includes a long, very wide concrete driveway, a concrete walkway to front door, front porch, back porch and deck, and swimming pool area (LOTS of concrete there).  I know for a fact I would have had to use at least 3 NiCd batteries to do this on the older model, if that would have even been enough.  I can do all of those areas, and still have prob. 1/4 power left in the battery.  Incredible!  Soooo nice not to have to switch out batteries so often.****I have used corded blowers, gas, and lastly, the older gen version of this B&D blower, which used NiCd batteries.  In comparison to the older B&D cordless blower, there are several advantages to this one, but interestingly, max output does not seem to be one of them (this new model DOES seem to push more CFMs (cubic feet/minute) than the older model, but not as much as I expected, personally).  Would be nice if B&D listed some kind of spec for this on their box or description.I also noticed that the in between model (the previous model to this one, which used Lithium Ion, but only an 18V battery) did not get very good reviews., and I wonder if it was probably due to expectation vs. reality.  This is NOT a replacement for a corded or gas blower, if you ever needed that much power.  The poor reviews might also be a result of people comparing that unit to the other tools it was often sold with as a kit (string trimmer, hedge trimmer), which from my experience, were excellent replacements for their corded or gas counterparts.  The ""sweeper"" has seemingly always been the weakest link in this series.Marketing was smart (or honest, at least) to use the term ""sweeper"" as well, because that is how you have to view these.  For LIGHT debris only, and mostly dry debris at that.  This is not going to blow layers of stuck down wet leaves from an aggregate surface (not well at least).  This is perfect for blowing out a garage, though, or a deck, or a driveway or a pool area.  Maybe better still, a roof, especially given the cordless/weight advantage of this thing.The big pros over the older NiCd model:1. VARIABLE speed control!  Yes!  This is awesome because I like to use this around my pool, and too much power there is a bad thing, as you blow all kinds of nastiness into the water.  Older model had only an on/off switch.2. Battery seems to be 10x better than the old NiCd ones I used (and still use).  This was my biggest complaint with the old model...after wheezing air for a few short minutes, it would begin to very quickly slow down.  Very frustrating.  This one lasts much longer, obviously, with the new lithium ion batteries, but also with the whopping 36V.  Nice. The battery level indicator is a very nice touch too...seems like a small thing, but adds quite a bit to the overall use satisfaction.3. Beefed up the bottom of the hose with a hefty scraper...nice...I definitely use this.  Not a big deal, again, just some more plastic, but also again, a small thing that actually makes this more enjoyable to use.So for light blowing work, I really don't see anything else on the market that can touch this...VERY lightweight, VERY neighbor (noise) friendly, and as long as you keep your expectations about the power in check, you should be very pleased.Highly recommended.  I look forward to replacing my other B&D cordless tools with this new gen series when they come out with them (I also have the older NiCd model of the extendable pole saw, which is AWESOME, and still going strong today).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8FY8PBWEKZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXTO41E#wasThisHelpful","RS8FY8PBWEKZL","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this little unique planter.If you aren't expecting it to hold a tomato plant, and you use it as directed (for small clumps of herbs, or better still IMO, as a seed starter), you won't be disappointed.I found the perfect place for it in my sun room that gets LOTS of morning sun, on the window sill.  It fit perfectly on the sill, but I had to kind of squish the herbs I had bought at the store into the smallish plastic chambers (they were planted in those ""in ground"" pots you are supposed to plant directly into the ground, that decompose quickly).I then used the remaining chambers for starting some broccoli and tomato seeds, which again, given the size of the individual chambers, it's more suited for.PROS:Looks fine aesthetics-wiseNarrow enough to fit on most window sillsUnique, expandable design allows for planting many different kinds of herbs or seedsCONS:Should come with at least ONE extra plastic liner...I am sure these are non-standard, so if you put a hole in one...oops!Even considering the stated use of this, I think the individual chambers are just too shallow, and quite small from an area perspective as well.  Just slightly bigger would have been perfect IMO.Overall, I would recommend this if you know that you don't want a lot of volume of herbs (unless you want to buy several of these), or use for starting seeds indoors.  I like the fact that you have several separate containers, but the sizes of those containers is REALLY limiting as to what you can put in there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFS7GSQ5RPMMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU0BD4M#wasThisHelpful","RFS7GSQ5RPMMC","A4GI4654JA8NK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GI4654JA8NK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog took to these very easily. I started by ringing the bell myself every time we'd go outside for my pup to go potty. Then, after a bit, I started picking up his paw and making him ring the bell before going outside. Pretty soon he got hold of the idea and started ringing the bells himself, and when he did, I'd immediately jump up and let him outside. He realized that bells=potty (I never rang the bells before a walk or outside play), and now he rings them every time he needs to go outside! ♦ FUNCTION 5/5 - Works great for my pup! (see above) ♦ LOOK 4/5 - They came in a bit twisted up, and like to twist while attached to the door, but other than that they are adorable!! ♦ LOUDNESS 3/5 - I got another brand of bells for another door in the house and they are much louder than these. To top it off, my dog is very gentle, so if I'm watching a movie loudly then I can accidentally miss hearing him ring the bells. ♦ SIZE 4/5 - They are fine for even my small under 8 pound cockapoo, but I would have still liked them to be just a touch longer, as he likes to ring the bells with his noes.OVERALL 4/5 - They work but could be improved slightly.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKYHU44J6AGXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4XD13C#wasThisHelpful","RKYHU44J6AGXE","A2BUQAZMNO7QH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BUQAZMNO7QH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I have combination skin, it's not what you would consider dry skin. In fact, I have acne. The thought of using oils to help reduce acne is a strange one, but one I'm very glad I tried out! I also use this for making perfumes, by mixing the Castor Oil with Essential Oils (more info below). ♦ Face & Acne 5/5 - Helps reduce my acne as well as the inflammation around where I've scratched my face. ♦ Hair 5/5 - Leaves my hair feeling soft and gives it a nice shine, without being too greasy (just don't use too much!) ♦ Skin 5/5 - Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple and, again, not greasy. I rub in Castor Oil prior to my Cocoa Butter lotion on my legs after I shave, and it really helps keep them from getting dry or irritated. ♦ Essential Oil use & perfume making 5/5 : I use this as a carrier oil for making essential oil perfume blends!

"BEST pillow that I've had to date. I've never had a Bamboo pillow before, but after a friend of mine telling me about how much she loves hers, I knew I had to try it out. My previous pillow was a VERY expensive memory foam pillow, but it still would leave my neck and jaw hurting on occasions. This Memory Foam Bamboo Pillow is miles ahead of anything I've had to date. It took away my neck pain, waking migraines and TMJ pain! Just a fantastic pillow all the way around. Here's how it stacks up: ♦ Comfort: 5/5 - WOW!!! I don't know what to say. It's firm, but not too firm. Soft, but not too soft. It's more ""solid"" feeling than my all-memory foam pillow, and come to find out, I like it much better! It supports and contours wonderfully. ♦ Side Sleeping 4/5 - It's still better than other pillows I've had, but it doesn't have the same amazing comfort as laying on your back. ♦ Back Sleeping 5/5 - This, for me, is really where the pillow shines! It cradles your head and comes up to meet the back of your neck. I sleep on my side, but in the mornings, I wake up and switch to my back and just lay there, letting the pillow hug my head and neck. ♦ Pain relief 5/5 - This is another place where this pillow shines. I have fairly chronic neck pain and off-and-on jaw pain due to TMJ. I also get migraines fairly frequently, especially when I would wake up in the mornings. The first night I used this pillow I was suffering from all 3. I had 3 days of straight migraine and TMJ jaw pain. I had also hurt my neck and shoulder the night before because I pulled some muscles working out. I went to bed in a lot of pain, but when I woke up ALL of these issues where gone. I was amazed and had no idea a pillow could even do that! ♦ Size: 4/5 - I ordered the Queen size, but I'm a little afraid that they may have sent me a King size(?) Because it's fairly long (from right to left). Longer than any other Queen sized pillow that I've had. ♦ Color & Construction: 5/5  - The color and print is nice. Even though it won't be seen much, it's nice. It's also well-constructed and seems like it will last for a very long time. ♦ Smell: 3/5 - It may have been from the plastic it was packed in, but, no matter what they say, there IS a chemical smell. I let it air out for a couple of days, however. The smell was still there somewhat, but I slapped a pillowcase on it, and I couldn't smell it anymore. So I proceeded to sleep on it and I've not had any issues. The pillow is also machine wash and dryable, and the smell would probably go away completely once washed.♦♦♦ OVERALL: 5/5 ♦♦♦ While the size and smell where somewhat of an issue, the comfort, construction, and pain relieving abilities FAR outweigh it.______________I was very happy to be able to received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RIC6DOIDKCX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYCRAUM#wasThisHelpful","R2RIC6DOIDKCX3","A2BUQAZMNO7QH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BUQAZMNO7QH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The chord is adjustable as well, which is great. You can also adjust it so that the plastic adjuster piece is to the side and not on the back of the neck, and I really appreciate that. ♦ Zippers/Velcro: 5/5 - Zippers slide smoothly and close securely.

"Here are my ratings based on what I've experienced: ♦ Size: 5/5 - (I got the small) While I personally prefer larger mouse pads, the small size mousepad is true to it's advertised size, and actually works better on a smaller desk and works best for my purposes. ♦ Color & Construction: 5/5  - The color is rich and beautiful! It's also well-constructed and seems like it will last for a long time. ♦ Nonslip bottom: 5/5 - Works great! I've tried it out on several surfaces and it sicks well to just about anything. I personally use mine on the curved serface of my couch's arm-rest (for when I'm using my laptop on the couch) and it sticks fantastically and doesn't slide around or fall down. ♦ Gaming: 4 to 5/5 - I would suggest Sentey's larger mousepad for gaming (I got the small), but the small still works well.

"Here are my ratings based on what I've experienced: ♦ Sizes: 5/5 - I love that these come with 2 sizes in one package (12 large and 12 small). It makes it so that I can match ALL of my containers and have a uniform look, even if some of them are different sizes. ♦ Write-ability: 5/5  - Great! You can easily write on these with either normal chalk, or with a chalk marker. This comes with a white chalk marker, which is great. I also purchased multicolored chalk markers and it makes these even cooler! The texture of the labels is nice and you can easily wipe them away. ♦ Dishwasher Safe 5/5 - I LOVE this! Sick on, wash, and no worries! The ink or chalk washes off, but that's fine for me. ♦ Price: 4/5  - At ~50 cents per sticker, I think it's a steal. There ARE cheaper options out there, but I don't think they look as nice, and most of them don't have a unified look. ♦ Included Marker: 5/5 - Writes nice, and the nib is reversible, so you can write with a thick OR a thin line, depending on what you want at the time. You can also use this marker to mark on other (non-porous) surfaces. Note that this does NOT include chalkboard paint, but it DOES include things that I never thought it would work on, like mirrors!♦♦♦ OVERALL: 5/5 ♦♦♦______________I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3HY69PYZYVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR4KSBK#wasThisHelpful","R1G3HY69PYZYVD","A2BUQAZMNO7QH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BUQAZMNO7QH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Far more than you would think. This is going to last me a very long time. ♦ Skin care: 5/5 - Has been helping me with my fine lines and wrinkles, when added to a carrier oil.

"This is a great Digital Thermometer, especially if you have a baby or an impatient kid, it's so hard to check baby's temperature by placing a thermometer under his/her armpit and waiting for over 3 minutes, my son is 5 and when he has fever he does not want to wait ether... so this thermometer is so awesome, literally it  detects the accurate body temperature in seconds, the easiest way, for me personally, is the forehead detection (you use button F1), also you can remove the blue cover and will be able to perform eardrum temperature detection ( button F2).

"These are cool Silicone Bracelets, for about 6 months now these are super popular, they called Live Lokai bracelets: the black ball contains mud from The Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth, and signifies life’s most difficult moments, filled with water sourced by sherpas from the heights of Mt.

Ok, first let me just say that I've been a huge fan of the Best Choice Products, all of their toys are very cool and well made, and the priced are real and affordable. Now onto this Construction Tractor: again it's remote control, so your kid will definitely have fun with that, it won't move as good on the carpeting, thought it does a bit, but any other flat surface will do, actually my son loves to put little toys/flat tracks on it's way and the tractor goes over those, I think it's kinda cool feature. Now you actually can control the Arm up and down as well. You will need 2 AA batteries for the remote control, but the rechargeable batteries for the tractor itself are included, so again great value. There is a switch on the bottom of the tractor, once you turn it on, the sit inside the tractor will light up, flashing lights from red to blue, and the toy makes cool tractor sounds!

"This is my first time trying this kind of thing, and I should say it actually gives me the desired shape... I have never tried any corsets before, but always was intrigued by the idea: would it actually work, would I feel comfortable in it...well to both those concerns I will answer: yes. It gives you that perfect shape: I do have a bit of a tummy, that i don't like and when I wear skin tight shirts, I just do not like the look, but with this corset it's different, the only thing that with some shirts you can tell that you wear a corset under: it's not bulky or nothing like that but since the closure is in front it gives it out a bit... but at the same time it's good that the closure is in front, that way you can put it on by yourself.

The ring says Love and it has its shine and glow to it, nice and comfortable fit, it didn't get uncomfortable or leave a green mark and I didn't break out in a rash. The ring is very light weight, the stones look nice and shiny. What I did not really like is the packaging: the ring comes in a little plastic baggie... so definitely if you want to order it as a gift, it won't be to appealing...at least in my opinion.

"I like this car mount! Fairly easy to put together, doesn't come with an instruction but it only has three pieces so you should be able to figure it out. I had a magnet car mount before, it worked fine, but I heard somewhere that magnets can be bad for the phone, so i decided to switch to this one, and I actually like it better.  It mounts perfectly and stably on my air vent, you'll have to turn the screw underneath to tighten it so it doesn't move after you put your phone in it and adjust to your liking.

"Cool toy, will keep your kid busy! First of all it's a very well made toy, but it's super easy for kids to disassemble and assemble at the same time: basically your kid get 3 toys trucks in one, it can be just a simple truck or a bulldozer or a dump excavator truck, my son absolutely loves it. You also will get a battery operated drill, requires 2 AA, which are included and a screw driver and a wrench key, all the tools are plastic and absolutely safe for kids 3 and up. Also it comes with 2 boulder balls and a driver. The truck itself runs on 3 AA batteries not included, there is a on/off switch on the bottom of the truck, once it's on the truck will go and play fun kid songs and the wrenches on the wheels will light up, also if the truck bumps into the wall or other toy it will turn and go, super cool. The colors are very nice and bright as well, which is also will grab any kid's attention, my 5 year old son literally can play hours with this truck: disassembling/assembling, transporting toys from one corner of the room to another. Not only it's a fun toy it's also will help you baby to develop some skills: by using the disassembling tools it will train your baby's hand-on abilities: motor skills, finger strength, hand-eye coordination, so that you baby will learn the right positioning of the small objects (screws), plus you kid will learn the names for all those tools and truck parts...

My favorite way to wear is have it a little bit unzipped: little bit of skin peek-a-boo, it looks sexy and classy at the same time and I love the shape it creates, you could wear a lace tank under and have the whole back unzipped or you can just zip it all the way and it gives you a different silhouette, so with one top you have different looks, so it's a big plus for me.

Copper is the essential mineral needed in the body, for many different reasons. Wearing a copper bracelet allows pure copper to be absorbed through the skin on a constant basis. bracelet contains 6 magnets which are encased in the bracelet to add more comfort and maximum effect.

"Very nice well made music toy. This Electronic Keyboard is suggested for kids ages 3 and up, my son is 5 and he absolutely loves this thing. The keyboard comes with detachable stand  and a small stool for the kid, everything is very sturdy and well made. Now on to the keyboard itself: this thing got so many functions, it will definitely keep your kid busy, my son literally can spend over an hour playing with it. 37 keys total and you can give those keys different sounds: piano and organ or there is also: mandolin, music box, trumpet, guitar, violin and bell, plus there are  8 different rhythms to choose from: slow rock, rock, new new, disco, march, waltz, samba and blues. Also there are 5 drum can flaps and 4 animal sounds: dog, cat, frog and bird, which is cool for smaller kids that way they can learn animal calls along with different musical instrument sounds. Of course there is a on/off button and volume is adjustable. Plus it comes with a microphone so your kid can sing along, my son loves to record his little melodies and let me listen to it later, when he's all done composing... You will need 4 AA batteries, yes 4: on the box as well as in description it says 6 for some reason, may be a mistake... the batteries are not included. This is very nice cool keyboard: good sounding, it also has some flashing lights. My son does like to take it off the stand some times and just play while laying on the couch. We did have a similar keyboard, but it wasn't as nice and did not have as many functions, so I would say this one is one of the nicest out there for smaller kids.

"This is a nice pillowcase for sure. First of all it's so much better to sleep on silk, especially when it comes to your face and hair, so silk pillowcases are so much better: first your hair will stay nice and smooth, unlike with cotton pillowcases your hair might look like ""birds nest"" in the morning, on silk ones your hair will slide, so my hair looks so much nicer in the morning when I use this case; another thing silk pillow cases don't leave as much marks on your face which prevents wrinkles, so i would definitely recommend to sleep on silk. This particular case is very nice, soft off white color, it's pretty large so should fit most pillows. I like that it zipps up, that way it always stays on. I wish both sides would be silk, since I like to change sides of my pillows during the week, I do have to wash it more regularly than i used to, since the bottom side is just cotton, but other than that it's a great pillow case.

Another cool thing about this shower head are the 8 different  modes of spray: rain, massage, sauna, tonic, rain+massage, rain+tonic, rain+sauna and pause, with these many modes anybody would be able to find the one they like, i love relaxing shower.

"Love it. Ok, first of all you will pay $160 for 3 boxes, 6 eye masks each, which is roughly $50 a box, witch makes puts one eye mask under $10, so it's not as expensive as it looks... Now on to the product itself, first of all each mask is individually sealed, you get 2 under eye patches in each foil pack, I have tried something similar before, but I was pleasantly surprised that these stay on no matter what: I could walk, lay on my side... they feel wet once you put it on but nothing drips and they don't slide down, so it was a huge plus to me. It's easy to apply these: the thinner part of the eye pad goes toward the inner area of the eye, I can actually apply these without even looking in the mirror. I usually apply these at night, after I cleanse my face, you can ""wear"" these up to 8 hours, so basically you could go to sleep in these, I usually have these on for 2-3 hours and I can see that these really work, the puffy eye look is not as bad as usual, which I always have puffy eyes no matter what and this mask really improved the look! You also get a sample of their eye cream which is very nice as well, I actually apply that one in the morning, before I put on my make up, it sinks into my skin super fast and wear perfect under the makeup. Great eye mask, definitely helps with puffiness and even brightens the dark under eye circles.

"The toy is pretty entertaining and brings up so many memories, cause i used to have one of these when I was little, so I decided to get one for my son. It's very well made, sturdy and unlike plastic ones the pins here won't break. It’s so easy to push an object into the pins to create instant art!! Whatever you want. We tried to make imprints of everything in our house: hands, toys, face...I would not recommend this for smaller kids since the pins are metal, they are not sharp, but still.

"Such a great idea and such a magical tradition for you and your kid! I absolutely love this set: first of all it comes in a cool box that looks like it came straight from Santa, my son have not seen it yet, but I know he is going to be so excited when the time comes. In the box you get Elf on the Shelf with the book, that explains why he was sent to your home...well while Elf on the Shelf is super fun, especially for parents, kids can not touch him...so it's so awesome that you get the Elf's pet Reindeer, unlike Elf, you kid can touch him, love him! The reindeer comes with a book as well, both books are hard cover, very nice bright illustrations and 2 great stories. My son is 5 so I thought it would be the perfect time to start this cool fun tradition, and I'm so happy that the set comes with the toy that my son can cuddle with: the reindeer is very soft. The Elf on the Shelf is one of Santa's helpers, he will be watching your kid, making sure he's been nice! The Reindeer is magical too, you show him love and his pendant heart will help Santa's sleight fly, so that he can bring presents for all the kids! Really fun and cool Christmas traditions, definitely recommend.

"This sweatshirt is exactly as pictured, very cool and bright, any teenage girl or young adult will love it! It's basically polyester fabric, little bit strechy, very soft to touch, the sweatshirt won't keep you super hot, it's more for cold spring/warm fall kinda shirt, but is exactly what I was looking for. If you love social media sites, if you love emojies, you will love this sweatshirt. The size states it will fit XS to M and it's true, if you wear XS it will look oversized which is a trend in sweatshirts, if you wear M and even L it will look good as well, I wear L and it fits just right, may be a bit too short in sleves, but not bad.

"Skin care is very importain to me, I am only 29 but I think it's never to early to use anti-aging products for your skin, we all love to look young, so i was super excited to try this awesome looking cream. First of all I have to comment on the packaginf: super beautiful highend looking packaging and product. Now on to the cream itself: it's formulated with a great blend of very powerful lifting, firming and moisturizing agents: hyaluronic acid, silk peptide, seaweed, amino acid and of course the 24 karat gold, so just looking on the ingredients I was super excited and this cream did not dissapoint me. I been using it for some time now and can honestly say that i love it, it does make my skin feel firmer and even tighter which I love, I dod not have much wrinckles and I want to keep it that way so ani-wrinckle action is a huge plus for me. The cream sinks in pretty fast and my skin feels hydrated and moisturized which is super importain for a good night cream.

"Let me just start by saying that we all need more veggies in our diet, frozen vegiies are not the same thing, it so much better to get fresh veggies, so I was super happy to try this Vegetable Steamer. I actually never saw anything like that before, the design of this steamer is quate unique:  instead of using a huge double boiler or having to buy an expensive electric steamer, I can now steam my vegetables with this smaller steamer that just fits into any pot and it take up minimum storage space. When the Sunsella Steamer arrives it will be folded up almost like a small upside down bowl, you just pulle it out and apart and it opens up into an open steamer, pretty cool. The steamer has a handle with a ring on it so you can pick it up. It has three legs underneath. Super easy to use and now I can easily cook up my veggies! Really great product.

"I have pretty long hair, so every time I straiten it with flat iron or curl it with the wond, I definitely need to separate my hair into sections and while I'm working on one section I need the rest of my hait stay out of the way, so these hair clips are the best for it. These are the professional croc hair clips, that you would find your hairdressers use in their salons, actually my sister is a hair stylist and she uses this kind of hair clips on her clients a lot, while she eather cuts their hair or styles, so you know when I got a pack of 6 I had to share with her and she says these are one of the best ones she've used. I got the simple black ones, but they have more color choises... These are very well made, I like the fact that these use metal springs, not plastic, as the ones with plastic have tendensess to break super fast. And these clips will literally hold any amount of hair: thin thread of hair, bangs or big bunch of thick or texured hair: the double hinge, the teeth and the texture combined to work their magic no matter what amount of hair they are asked to corral. So if these are perfect for professional use you know it makes my every day hair routine so much easier, I hate having to constantly adjust my clips while styling to keep them from slipping out, but these don't give me any trouble.

"This is actually my first ever pocket saw, I did not know what to expect, but now I can say this thing is pretty cool and come in handy in many cases of emergency. I actually got this pocket chainsaw for my husband, he is a big fanatic of survival gear, so you know he was pretty excited about it. This pocket chain saw is a 25"" long, chain saw blade attached to two nylon handles; the length of the saw with the handles is 40"". It comes in a handy neat and compact pouch, so you literally keep the ""saw"" in your pocket. My husband did use it a couple times already and it's pretty easy to work, you will have to put some effort in though. We had a storm and had bunch of big branches in our yard, so this little thing came in handy to clear all those big limbs from our yard. It's also comes in handy if you like to go camping and stuff, this pocket chainsaw takes up minimum space in your pocket or backpack and as I said it's pretty easy to work it: the blade doesnot flip while in use and it comes out pretty clean, so minimum maintnens too.

First of all it's natural and organic, so how can you go wrong with it, it is suitable for all skin types, my skin is normal but sometimes can be very sensitive to new products, but as I've said been using this creame for a couple of weeks and no break outs so it's a first plus. Another thing is after applying the creame the skin feels, nice, smooth, hydrated and kinda tigthened, which I love. There really is no smell to it,  just a faint, light natural scent, which fades immediately. Hyaluronic Acid is in here, as well as Collagen and Vitamin C. These are fantastic for bringing some youth back to our skin, so I definitely a fan.

"I love this apron, super cute and functional! I love love to cook, but cooking can be messy, so an apron is a must have for me, this one is one of the nicest one I've ever had; first of all let me just say how cute it is; the prink is simple but little ancors give it some edge and the two cute bows make it some girly and cute, it also has some ruffles, so again it's super adorable. Another thing i love about this apron is that it has a waterproof lining, so it you splatter some oil, water, wine or anything for that matter it will stain the apron but not your clothes, so this is a huge plus! And you got two pockets, so there is some storage place if you need it. Definitely one of the prettiest and functional aprons I've ever had, recommend it for sure!

"My wife’s doctor recommended that she take a daily supplement of CoQ10, and she’s been taking this supplement now for about three weeks. Happily, there have been no unpleasant side effects. It was prescribed because CoQ10 provides energy to the heart. My wife doesn’t have a serious heart problem, so the supplement is being taken in addition to proper diet and exercise in order to prevent serious heart disease. She babysits for our granddaughters two or three times a week, which involves lots of walking. She often came home very tired.

"“Faust,"" directed by F.W. Murnau, based on the play of the same name by Goethe and the play “The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus” by Christopher Marlowe, ranks with “Metropolis” as one of the greatest achievements of German silent cinema. Gosta Ekman stars as the title alchemist who, struggling with his faith in the midst of a devastating plague, is offered the power to cure and the gift of youth in exchange for his soul. Mephisto (Emil Jannings, “The Last Laugh”) is seen earlier wagering with an angel (Werner Fettered) that he can destroy the soul of anyone, even the beneficent Prof. Faust. Jannings provides an intense performance which ranges from charming to comical to horrifying.The deliberate artificiality of the expressionistic set design suggests a netherworld in which the Devil uses his wiles to lure mortals with transitory gratification, knowing that ultimately their souls will be his. The lighting design contributes to an ominous, forbidding atmosphere that elicits chills.Murnau put his cast through rigorous filming in order to achieve some incredible visuals. In one memorable scene, he had Jannings stand for hours while three powerful fans blew clouds of soot to make his cloak billow twelve feet above his head. Camille Horn, playing the lovely Gretchen, had to endure hours tied to a stake with flames raging around her from 20 burners.This 1926 work holds up today largely because of its sheer epic nature. With numerous references to Dutch, German and Italian painting, the film reflects painstaking detail and a lavish budget. “Faust” was Murnau’s last film in Germany before he came to the United States to make “Sunrise.”The Blu-ray release contains a digitally restored print in HD from 35-mm archival elements. There are two soundtrack options: a piano score adapted from the 1926 orchestral arrangement by Paul Hensel, and an orchestral score by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Also included is “The Language of Shadows: Faust,” a 53-minute documentary on the making and restoration of Murnau’s film; test footage of Ernst Lubitsch’s abandoned production “Marguerite and Faust;” and a bonus DVD featuring the alternate 1930 cut of “Faust” with an original score by Timothy Brock, performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3OM0NALJCQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K366AU#wasThisHelpful","RV3OM0NALJCQ8","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Applesauce,"" directed by Onur Tukel, concerns a married man who is severely tested after a string of twisted, mysterious and frightening events. Every Tuesday night, radio talk show host Stevie Bricks (Dylan Baker) invites his listeners to call in and share “the worst thing they’ve ever done.” Tonight, high school teacher Ron Welz (Onur Tukel) tells his story. Soon after, someone starts sending him severed body parts. Ron becomes paranoid and then terrified. His life begins to unravel. His marriage begins to fall apart. He has no idea who’s tormenting him. Is it his insolent high school student? His best friend? His own wife? In a city like New York, there are eight million suspects and each one could have a bone to pick with someone like Ron.Tukel’s portrayal of a teacher quick to offer opinions and concoct viewpoints on the fly is amusing. He fancies himself an intellectual scholar, but lacks the required gravitas. Yet despite some sharp writing and a series of clever one-liners, “Applesauce” meanders off onto numerous tangents and the characters appear contrived as they banter and bicker among themselves, flippantly discussing serious topics. Tukel constructs his scenes with a comic punchline in mind rather than building them naturally. The movie is reminiscent of a Woody Allen comedy with its New York City location, eccentric characters, and humorous look at male-female relationships, but never really sparkles.Special features on the unrated Blu-ray release include commentary with director Onur Tukel, deleted scenes, blooper reel, and theatrical trailer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38L5E8690DJ65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W7LREK#wasThisHelpful","R38L5E8690DJ65","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Mask” holds the distinction of being not only Canada’s first horror film, but the country’s first 3D film as well. Filmed in Toronto in 1961 on a small budget, the movie was released seven years after the first 3D craze in Hollywood had run its course. Psychiatrist Allen Barnes (Paul Stevens) inherits a bejeweled tribal mask from a suicidal patient and becomes fixated on it. Each time he touches it, a disembodied voice commands him to “put the mask on now,” which he does. This is also the signal for the viewer to put on 3D glasses to see the frightening visions Barnes is subjected to. Barnes continues to explore this terrifying new psychic world even as the mask reveals a latent violence in the doctor’s own nature that threatens those closest to him.The 3D sequences are creepy, surrealistic nightmares brought to life. Human skulls grow eyeballs, snakes pop out of sockets, women are sacrificed and burned alive, and masked ghouls reach out threateningly. Director Julian Roffman uses the 3D sequences effectively to build suspense and illustrate the deterioration of Barnes’ mind. These segments have a distinctive look designed by montage expert Svalko Vorkapich to be unsettling, otherworldly, and sinister. The movie is in 3D only when Barnes puts on the mask.The new stereoscopic edition is restored from original 35-millimeter elements and requires a 3D TV, player, and special glasses. The result is excellent and far outshines earlier analglyphic VHS 3D releases that relied on the old red and blue cardboard glasses. Bonus content includes audio commentary, a 20-minute profile of director Julian Roffman; 4 trailers and TV spots; short films by Slavko Vorkapich; and the 3D animated short “One Night in Hell.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEXE0FT6NQHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LHPGU6#wasThisHelpful","R1OEXE0FT6NQHC","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Don’t Look Back” is a documentary by D.A. Pennebaker of Bob Dylan’s three-week tour of England in 1965, his last as an acoustic performer. The film captures the 24-year-old Dylan at a time when the public was beginning to realize that he had some important, timely things to say. Using cinema verite techniques — hand-held cameras, existing lighting, no bulky and obtrusive moviemaking equipment — Pennebaker was able to squeeze into corners of hotel rooms, backstage areas, press conferences, and onto stages themselves. Because the film is not narrated, the viewer does not rely on subjective commentary. Instead, an unfiltered portrait of Dylan emerges. We see him creating, lounging around, being playful, losing his temper with his entourage, refusing to answer questions posed by British journalists, and performing in concert. The movie shows the contrast between Dylan’s sweet stage persona and his off-stage, tightly wound self. Joan Baez, Donovan, and Alan Price also appear in the movie but Dylan clearly dominates.Songs include “The Times They Are A-Changin,” “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” “It’s All Right Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” “The Gates of Eden,” and “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” One of the movie’s most famous sequences shows Dylan holding cards on which the lyrics to “Subterranean Homesick Blues” are written. As the song plays on the soundtrack, Dylan reveals one card after another with key lyrics. This was the singer’s suggestion, and makes for a one-of-a-kind moment.The new Blu-ray release contains a restored digital transfer, but since the film dates back to 1967, it is not in the pristine condition usually associated with Blu-ray. Bonus content includes 1999 audio commentary with Pennebaker and tour manager Bob Neuwirth; “65 Revisited,” a 2006 documentary by Pennebaker; audio excerpt from a 2000 interview with Bob Dylan; featurettes tracing the evolution of Pennebaker's filming style; 3 short films by Pennebaker, outtakes from “Don’t Look Now,” alternate version of the film’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues” cue card sequence; 5 recordings of Dylan songs not used in the film; and a booklet with a critical essay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UQBSPTQX47Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141RBH90#wasThisHelpful","R36UQBSPTQX47Q","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Badger Gamer” is about a blackmail plan gone wrong. Liam (Sam Boxleitner) is a successful businessman whose girlfriend, Alex (Augie Duke), discovers that he’s married with a family and resolves to exact revenge. Enlisting the aid of her brother, Kip (Patrick Cronen), her former best friend, Shelly (Jillian Leigh), and another of Liam’s mistresses Jane (Sasha Higgins), Alex comes up with a scheme to kidnap Liam and extort $2 million from his private accounts. The title of the film refers to a method of blackmailing married men by intentionally placing them in a compromising situation.Since none of the kidnappers is a professional criminal, things backfire from the outset, spiraling from one wrong move to another. What appeared to be a simple plan becomes complicated by the various relationships between Liam and each of the kidnappers, the original plan changes, and things turn violent.Directors Josh Wagner and Thomas Zambeck provide greater depth of character than one customarily finds in low-budget horror flicks and lace the proceedings with generous helpings of dark humor. The unrated film becomes jarring when splashes of blood and other graphic images are introduced, but the blend of violence and humor works, and the plot creates enough suspense to keep the viewer on edge and involved.Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary with writer/directors Wagner and Dambeck and stars Augie Duke, Jillian Leigh and Sasha Higgins, and cast and crew interviews from the Los Angeles premiere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SSBTATE75MM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WSGTOE#wasThisHelpful","R1SSBTATE75MM3","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Musicals: The Definitive Illustrated Story” is a lush look at Broadway and Hollywood musicals, stars, and the people who wrote the scores. Its main attractions are the great production photos, movie stills, sheet music reproductions, posters, costume illustrations, and timelines for Broadway shows that indicate where in the plot particular songs appear. The book begins with “Show Boat” (1927) and concludes with a revival of “Into the Woods” (2014). The shows and films are listed in chronological order. London’s West End musicals are also covered.This impressive coffee table book is tailor-made for folks who love musicals. The text is informative and often provides little-known stories about the making of the shows and films. Other books have focused exclusively on either the Broadway musical or the movie musical, but I like the fact that this volume pays homage to both. Those who like musicals, after all, appreciate both forms.Most likely because photos of older Broadway shows are hard to come by, movie stills dominate. The entry for “Kismet” refers to the 1953 Broadway show, but the stills are from the 1955 film. The same holds true for “Camelot,” “Oliver!,” and “My Fair Lady.” As a Broadway musical devotee, I was somewhat disappointed that the performers of the original shows were not depicted.I’m not sure about the “definitive” in the title, but the book sure does attempt to be all-inclusive. It’s a beautifully designed book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJC6NLOYM7GHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465438866#wasThisHelpful","RJC6NLOYM7GHA","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Deadliest Prey” is a sequel to 1987’s “The Deadly Prey.” In the earlier film, Special Forces soldier Mike Danton (Ted Prior) was reluctantly drawn into conflict with Colonel Hogan (David Campbell), his ex-commanding officer. Thrown into the middle of the woods nearly naked and without weapons, Danton was forced to fight huge numbers of armed soldiers to survive. He did survive, killing all but one — Col. Hogan. In the current film, Hogan is released from prison and immediately determines to seek revenge on Danton. He quickly reconnects with his troops and has Danton kidnapped with a nefarious plan to make him suffer before he’s killed.An action flick in the style of “Rambo,” “Deadliest Prey” is cartoon-like in its larger-than-life lead characters and seems more a carbon copy of the original than a continuation. Director David A. Prior provides practically non-stop mayhem but little else. You won’t find terrific acting or clever dialogue here. It’s an unapologetic action movie with a simple, straightforward plot pitting two modern-day warriors against each other. This movie and its predecessor owe much to “The Most Dangerous Game” and “The Naked Prey,” films in which protagonists battle enormous obstacles to survive.There is an interesting subtext to “The Deadliest Game.” As we watch Hogan, who’s been stewing in jail for 27 years planning vengeance, we see how his military service in Vietnam has hardened him and wounded him mentally. He uses the skills he learned as a U.S. Marine to fashion the ultimate revenge. Hogan suggests officials in ancient Rome who conducted gladiatorial matches to the death for the pleasure of the masses.Bonus features on the unrated Blu-ray release include interviews with Ted Prior, David A. Prior, David Campbell, and  Fritz Matthews.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JIV1QMZBNGVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C6OS10#wasThisHelpful","R1JIV1QMZBNGVA","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Jimmy’s Hall,"" based on a true story, is a cultural center in Ireland dedicated to dances, art classes, and other non-controversial ventures. Jimmy Gralton (Barry Ward) opened the hall in 1922, but on the brink of civil war and with unwanted attention from the church and other politicians, he is forced to flee and the hall to close. To avoid arrest, Jimmy travels to New York, where he remains for ten years. Returning in 1932, Jimmy sees that the hall has fallen into disrepair. Encouraged by old friends, he determines to reopen the once popular venue, but finds that old hostilities are still very much alive. Father Sheridan (Jim Norton) is his primary opponent.This clergyman regards the hall as a center of sin and depravity. Jimmy must face small-town attitudes and the fear that he is fostering communism through the planned use of the hall as a meeting place of ordinary folks. He turns activist crusader when he sees the widespread poverty and growing cultural oppression in his old hometown.If the plot sounds like that of the movie “Footloose,” there are similarities, but “Jimmy’s Hall” is far more political in nature. There’s a David vs. Goliath theme that portrays Jimmy as the popular underdog in a largely Catholic community in which the Church is a powerful, intimidating force.Director Ken Loach sets up the period effectively and portrays Jimmy as a Capra-esque crusader awakened to the needs of his community. Ward plays Jimmy as a more worldly counterpart of his fellow townsfolk. He has, after all, spent a decade in New York.Bonus extra on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, commentary with Barry Ward, and a making-of featurette.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5GC7KDTM58B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N8JHWK#wasThisHelpful","R2L5GC7KDTM58B","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Tap World” is a cool documentary about dancers devoted to the art of tap and their efforts to influence their communities by instilling a respect for and appreciation of tap dancing. The film features an assortment of dancers from all over the world, some tapping for personal enjoyment, others trying to make a living at it. Tappers in Taipei, Tokyo, Paris, Australia, India and the United States are shown exhibiting their talents.Tap dancing has its roots in the 19th century minstrel shows but became a fixture of 20th century vaudeville and movies through the performances of such legendary artists as Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and the Nicholas Brothers. Fred Astaire performed an elaborate tap production number tribute to Robinson in “Swing Time” (1936) and Shirley Temple matched Robinson step for step in “The Little Colonel” (1935). Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, and Debbie Reynolds did a great tap number in “Singin’ in the Rain” (1952) and some fancy tapping footwork was featured in the Academy Award-winning Best Picture, “The Artist” (2011). Dancers Gregory Hines and Savion Glover breathed new life into the art form and made tap appealing to an entire new generation at the turn of the century.For “Tap World,” tap dancers of all ages were encouraged to share their individual journey to be considered for inclusion. More than 115 submissions were received from more than a dozen countries. The most compelling were chosen and woven into the film alongside some of the masters of tap. Some of the performers include a New Jersey man who has kept dancing even after losing a leg to bone cancer; a Brazilian tap dancer who mentors underprivileged kids; a young man who escaped his crime-ridden neighborhood and financed his college education by dancing for handouts aboard New York City subways; and a Pennsylvania woman who’s dedicated herself to teaching adult tap dancers.There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IG9VO1HXZ230/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148OGI7W#wasThisHelpful","R3IG9VO1HXZ230","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Seymour: An Introduction,"" directed by Ethan Hawke, is a profile of pianist/composer/teacher Seymour Bernstein. The documentary shows Bernstein instructing his students and sharing insights based on his long history as a professional musician. We see him in his native habitat — a cluttered New York City apartment with a piano in one corner, where he has lived for 57 years. His students share the bench with him as they practice Chopin and Schubert. Occasionally, he takes their hands and guides them over the keys to impart a helpful technique.The movie doesn’t go into extensive biographical background. Its strength is focusing on the man whose wisdom comes from long life experience, common sense, and love of music. Hawke does inform us that Bernstein was in the army during the Korean War and performed in a classical trio for his fellow soldiers. He turned to teaching full time in the 1950s and lived for a time in London. He was once the protege of a wealthy patroness who lavished him with adoration and material gifts in her mansion. He had to overcome stage fright during his years as concert pianist.Hawke met Bernstein at a dinner party and was inspired to make this film. Bernstein is the antithesis of the monstrous music teacher played by J.K. Simmons in “Whiplash.” Movies about teachers generally portray them as saints or deeply flawed, but seldom realistically, as shown here. Soft-spoken and tender with his students, Bernstein is a master instructor who never raises his voice, loses patience, or has temper tantrums. Maestro Bernstein shares two valued gifts with his students: his love of music and his ability to explain verbally the transcendent effect of music.Special features include footage of Seymour Bernstein in concert, and a trailer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDL6YZBMK74D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W7LURO#wasThisHelpful","R1NDL6YZBMK74D","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Pixels” has a strange concept for a movie geared to kids. When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth through video games — Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and such. Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), a teenage video-game champion from the original heyday of the games, is empowered by President of the United States William Cooper (Kevin James) to save humankind.The problem is that the target audience has never heard of these games, so they will not be in on the basic joke. The film combines live action with computer-generated “monsters” that look more silly than threatening. The acting — if you can call it that — is atrocious, and Sandler is given far too much screen time doing shtick. It’s hard to accept James as the President, even in a picture as goofy as this one. He mugs shamelessly, probably to compensate for the lack of real comedy in his role, and director Chris Columbus (“Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”) fails to reign him in. The supporting cast is impressive —Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Jane Krakowski — but fail to add any pizzazz to the lame script by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling.The 2-disc 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray edition contains 8 behind-the-scenes featurettes and a music video.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LF0AC5VCWL7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DWS874#wasThisHelpful","R2LF0AC5VCWL7V","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Great American Dream Machine” was an irreverent, satirical weekly variety show aired nationally on PBS for two seasons from 1971-1972. The show was unlike any ever seen on public television and seemed to bask in controversy during the pre-Watergate era. Chevy Chase, Albert Brooks, Penny Marshall, Henry Winkler, Andy Rooney, Tiny Tim, David Steinberg, and Charles Grodin honed their comic talents on this show and went on to greater fame on television and the movies. Humorist and commentator Marshall Efron hosted. A combination of humorous skits, drama, musical performances and political commentary, the program was considered public TV’s first prime-time hit and inspired such later shows as “Saturday Night Live,” “The Daily Show,” and “The Colbert Report.”Produced by WNET in New York, “The Great American Dream Machine” was called the “intellectual ‘Laugh-In’” and reflected a growing counterculture, poking fun at politics, mass culture, advertising, and television itself with cleverly written sketches and wide-ranging vignettes. The show was born at a time in public television when producers were encouraged to explore new ways to use the medium, to be spontaneous, to stun, shock, amuse, annoy, and give viewers a different way of seeing the world. Because it ran on PBS, its creators were not beholden to sponsors, which enabled ordinarily taboo subjects to be covered. The war in Vietnam and the Nixon White House were frequent targets of the program’s satire.The 4-disc box set contains close to 13 hours of comedy and opinion, including Marshall Efron’s “Lemon Pie From Scratch” sketch, Albert Brooks’ “School for Comedians,” Andy Rooney’s pre-“60 Minutes” opinion segments, Chevy Chase’s “Singing Faces” mime, “Great American Weather Days” — a Dream Machine-style weather forecast with a glance back at some of the greatest days in U.S. weather history — a “Great American Hero” profile of daredevil Evel Knievel, and Elaine Stritch performing Stephen Sondheim’s “Here’s to the Ladies Who Lunch.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3K02351I5DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAZHRZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3T3K02351I5DE","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“I Want to Live” is based on the true story of Barbara Graham (Susan Hayward), executed for murder in 1955. Graham was convicted of murdering an elderly widow named Mabel Monahan and died in the gas chamber, but she may have been framed for the crime by two acquaintances who were trying to save themselves. Though there is doubt as to whether Graham actually was innocent, the movie is sympathetic to her. Graham’s backstory, noir atmosphere, and courtroom melodrama form the setting for Hayward’s riveting performance. She won the Best Actress Oscar, beating out both Rosalind Russell (“Auntie Mame”) and Elizabeth Taylor (“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”).One of the grimmest aspects of the movie is the detailed sequence on preparing the gas chamber. This is the first film to be so graphic, and the matter-of-fact way in which the guards and prison officials are shown getting the chamber ready with such precision is chilling. Because the film raises considerable doubt about Graham’s innocence, it stands as an indictment of capital punishment. The screenplay is based on Graham’s own letters and articles that appeared in the “San Francisco Examiner,”  and was nominated for an Academy Award.Director Robert Wise (“The Sound of Music,” “Star Trek: The Motion Picture”) shows us how Graham’s situation spirals ever downward, with one bad break after another taking her ever closer to execution. One of the most dramatic scenes is Graham being led to the gas chamber, only to receive a temporary stay of execution. Hayward’s performance in this scene, in particular, is raw and disturbingly believable.There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HV74UCGFPYSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BUQORO#wasThisHelpful","R1HV74UCGFPYSD","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Southpaw” is the story of a man fighting, both in the boxing ring and out, to regain his self-respect and win back the respect of his family.When we first meet Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) , he’s at the top, having just won the light-heavyweight boxing championship. Married to beautiful Maureen (Rachel McAdams, “Midnight in Paris,” “The Vow”), with a doting daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence), he lives with his family in a lushly appointed mansion. But Billy’s circumstances change dramatically after a tragedy throws him into a deep funk that costs him Maureen, Leila, and his home.In the depths of depression, he persuades gym manager Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to get him back in shape for the big time. The crusty Tick, channeling Burgess Meredith’s Mickey in “Rocky,” demands complete obedience to his strict training regimen. But the main plot of “Southpaw” involves the deteriorating relationship between Billy and Leila and its eventual mending. This process is depicted realistically, not rushed in montage form. We feel that their reconciliation requires as much work from Billy as his fight training. Winning back the love and respect of his daughter becomes Billy’s highest priority, a first step to reclaiming his role as father.Directed by Antoine Fuqua (“The Equalizer,” “Training Day”), “Southpaw” is an amalgam of many earlier fight films, particularly “Raging Bull” and “Rocky.”Gyllenhaal does a good job of conveying the constant pain of a fighter, even after winning a bout, as he slowly rises from a bed, hobbles from one room to the next, winces when he moves a certain way. Overall, though, his performance is terribly one-note, as he mutters and mumbles his way through the picture, whether Billy’s times are good or bleak.Mr. Whitaker provides a sobering, down-to-earth performance as the trainer turned gym owner who’s been there and seen it all. Tick provides the motivation for Billy to get his life back together. Whitaker knows how to underplay a scene for maximum effect rather than showboat.Ms. McAdams’ Maureen is figuratively in Billy’s corner through every fight and understands that the ring is Billy’s life, not just his source of income. She’s the organizer, planner, businesswoman and soulmate whom Billy completely trusts with his career and future.Rated R, “Southpaw” contains extremely authentic, bloody fight sequences filmed from angles familiar to TV viewers of pro boxing matches. Gyllenhaal and Miguel Gomez, who plays Billy’s opponent in the climactic fight, are precisely choreographed, giving these scenes a raw authenticity.Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted scenes, Q & A with cast, making-of featurette, and an extended training montage. A Digital HD copy is included.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BRQW3GSGR74C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BPM536#wasThisHelpful","R2BRQW3GSGR74C","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Epic of Everest” is a documentary chronicling the 1924 expedition by George Mallory and Andrew Irvine to reach the peak of Mt. Everest. The expedition is still clouded in mystery. Both climbers died as well as several others who accompanied them. It is not known whether they actually reached the mountain’s summit. The mountaineers were joined by filmmaking pioneer Captain John Noel who filmed every aspect of the effort, capturing considerable climbing footage as well as images of local wildlife and culture of the Tibetan region, an area seldom seen by foreigners at the time. The movie contains the first images on film of both Everest and Tibet, stimulating worldwide interest in this remote part of the world.The new restoration features landscapes resembling the terrain of distant planets in science fiction films. Noel obtained some stunning views of the mountain at various times of the day, with sunlight casting atmospheric shadows. Inter titles indicate the various perils that faced the climbers, with the elements a chief obstacle. Of particular interest are the scenes of daily life among the Sherpas, views of the world’s highest village and several monasteries, and footage of the trek to the mountain in a caravan of yaks. Made just two years after Robert J. Flaherty’s “Nanook of the North,” “The Epic of Everest” introduced the public to yet another distant, frigid part of a still largely unexplored planet.Special features on the Blu-ray edition include an introduction by Noel’s daughter, Sandra Noel, featurettes about the scoring of the film and its restoration, and a trailer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31LOZ7RYVECY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S09OS0#wasThisHelpful","R31LOZ7RYVECY8","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Deutschland 83” is an espionage TV series from Germany.  Martin (Jonas Nay) is a 24-year-old East German who is taken from a comfortable life in the military and, against his will, turned into a spy for the Stasi, the nation’s secret police. His assignment: he must assume another man’s identity and become an aide to a West German general at the heart of NATO’s nuclear-deterrance strategy. The show blends actual historical events with fiction. Ronald Reagan and other world leaders of the period are seen in video clips, issuing their blunt Cold War threats and warnings and serving as backdrop to the adventures of burgeoning spy Martin.The show succeeds in capturing the paranoia of the 1980s when superpowers mistrusted each other and each played a game of one-upmanship from diplomatic posturing to the size of their nuclear arsenals. The personal story often feels forced, as when Martin’s aunt (Maria Schrader) pushes her nephew into the spy game, promising that his success will place his mother, who needs a kidney transplant, on a high place on the transplant waiting list. There’s also a so-so romantic subplot involving a girlfriend whom Martin is reluctant to leave.What distinguishes the series is that Martin isn’t immediately transformed into a Teutonic James Bond. He’s initially awkward at even the most basic of tasks. The writers also have fun showing Martin being baffled and amazed at the culture, luxuries and technologies of the West. For those who like good old-fashioned spy-vs.-spy intrigue, there is that, too, but it all has a refreshing look as channeled through the eyes of a novice agent learning on the job.The DVD release contains 8 widescreen episodes on 3 discs. Bonus features include interviews and a Q & A with cast and creators. Episodes are in German, with English subtitles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYIY3XK247WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYW5N1U#wasThisHelpful","R1UYIY3XK247WA","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Play Motel” falls into the category of Italian sexploitation thriller. Directed by Mario Gariazzo, the film opens at the garishly illuminated Play Motel where several buxom blondes are being secretly photographed while having kinky sex. The motel, just outside of town, is the destination of rich, respectable men who come to live out their perverted sexual fantasies with accommodating call girls. Rinaldo Cortesi (Enzo Fisichella) is an upper-class citizen who discreetly picks up a sexy blonde woman named Loredana (Marina Frajese) in the lobby of the Play Motel and brings her to an upstairs room. More than pleasure awaits him.Because director Gariazzo is obsessed with elaborate soft core-style sex scenes, the plot is often hard to follow. The film has a creepy allure, though many viewers will be bored by the far-too-lengthy displays of flesh rather than titillated. The plot hinges on a blackmail scheme directed against affluent male visitors to the establishment. There are the makings of a decent thriller lurking in the plot, but it’s unfortunately not developed adequately. The screenplay could use a solid dose of Agatha Christie polish. Acting is pretty good, even though the performers have to slog their way through unimaginative dialogue and a sluggish pace.Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include a booklet containing background production information, original cover art, and the featurette “Midas Touch,” about the production company that made “Play Motel.”","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H6KDL0FA0489/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQTCPAO#wasThisHelpful","R2H6KDL0FA0489","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Jurassic World” is the fourth movie in a franchise that makes dinosaurs the stars. The perfect summer film, it features action all the way through with few slow spots, mostly because director Colin Trevorrow keeps assorted dinosaurs on screen most of the time.The island off the coast of Costa Rica that first saw the rebirth of dinosaurs in “Jurassic Park,” Steven Spielberg’s 1993 megahit, has gone corporate. Now a massive theme park along the lines of Disney World, it attracts tourists from all over the world. The attraction’s operations manager, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), is highly organized and prides herself on running a tight ship. So thoroughly focused is she on every detail of the park’s day-to-day workings that she has delegated the job of looking after her visiting nephews (Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins) to an assistant.To keep the customers coming, the research branch of the corporation has been genetically engineering new species. Indominus Rex, a hybrid of Tyrannosaurus and other secret ingredients, will be the park’s newest cash cow.Animal handler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) has been training a quartet of velociraptors to respond to simple commands. His success at this endeavor has caught the attention of Hoskins (Vincent D’Onofrio), a military contractor who sees the potential of the animals’ use in warfare. When the park’s dinosaurs start acting up as we expect and other characters are panicking, Grady uses his knowledge and instincts to deal with the crisis. Pratt has an Indiana Jones aura about him — down to earth, knowledgeable, sensitive, and ready to step in when his know-how and guts are most needed.Among the remarkable visual sequences, some are surprisingly tranquil, such as a park ride in which two people enter a contraption much like a hamster ball that travels through open grassland filled with gigantic herbivores who amble by, unconcerned by the occasional intrusion of these humans rolling by in bubble containers. There are also numerous ghost-like holograms throughout the park, heralding various exhibits. These look especially cool with the film’s 3D enhancement.But when it comes down to what this picture is all about, it’s the dinosaurs running amok, rendered more realistically than ever. One terrific sequence after another builds to an exciting climax. Folks who come for the dinosaurs will leave satisfied. Although the plot recycles some of the elements of “Jurassic Park,” such as children in peril, science versus commerce, and humanity’s arrogance at attempting to control nature, it also addresses the issue that the dinosaurs are living creatures and deserve to be treated as such rather than as mere profitable attractions.The plot echoes the challenge of real-world Hollywood studios who have to freshen up franchises with what’s “bigger, better, greater” to keep audiences coming. Rated PG-13, “Jurassic World” delivers those thrills with exceptionally well crafted sequences of prehistoric animals gone amok in a modern world.The 3-disc 3D Blu-ray Combo Pack contains three formats: 3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, and DVD. Bonus features exclusive to Blu-ray include “Closest Shaves,” a series of clips from all the films in the franchise showing scary encounters with dinosaurs; Chris Pratt and director Colin Trevorrow discussing key moments in the film supported by behind-the-scenes footage; and a making-of featurette. Bonus features on all formats include deleted scenes and the featurettes “Dinosaurs Roam Once Again” and “Chris and Colin Take on the World.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0XAEMB76YCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P0X0WQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C0XAEMB76YCW","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Texas Rising” is a History-TV mini-series that covers the early history of Texas and its war of independence from Mexico. The series opens with the smoldering ruins of the Alamo in 1836. The film switches back and forth from various camps whose men are trying to hold onto territory. General Sam Houston (Bill Paxton) is a strategic leader, weighing the consequences of impulsive actions to avenge the Alamo massacre. This puts him at odds with many of his followers as he spouts heroic-sounding lines while figuring the best time and place to make a move. He sends Emily West (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to avenge her dead brother by serving as a spy.Meanwhile, General Santa Anna (Olivier Martinez) with his huge force is preening after defeating the outnumbered Alamo defenders and feels complete victory is well within his grasp. He is portrayed as a slimy, ambitious military man who sees the Texas campaign as stepping stone to a political career.Other characters include Deaf Smith (Dean Morgan), a courageous Texas Ranger with a secret illness, Lorca (Ray Liotta), an Alamo survivor who goes on a murderous rampage, President Andrew Jackson (Kris Kristofferson), and half-breed Texas Ranger Billy Anderson (Brendan Fraser).At 7 1/2 hours, the series is way too long. There’s so much padding, uninteresting subplots, and jumping around that viewers will lose interest well before the series’ resolution. Performances are fine and the casting interesting, but its length ultimately is its worst enemy. There’s not enough material to justify so much screen time. Battles are well staged, for the most part, but the elimination of the Alamo siege is a misstep. This might have been covered in a montage, just to set the stage for what follows. Instead, the viewer is thrown into the aftermath of the siege. It’s almost like coming into a movie theatre and missing not only a big sequence, but the springboard for everything to follow.Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include profiles on Sam Houston and Santa Anna, and a behind-the-scenes, making-of featurette.

"“The Vampire Diaries: The Complete Sixth Season” picks up several months after the fall of the “other side.” Most of the main characters are living in denial and disillusion as they attempt to move on after losing two of their best friends. Rather than grieve, however, Caroline (Candice Accola) has chosen to fight to reverse the spell keeping them all from returning home to Mystic Falls. Elena (Nina Dobrev) copes with Damon’s death by drinking a magic potion that allows her to interact with a counterfeit version of Damon. Stefan (Paul Wesley) plays at being a mechanic and becomes involved romantically with a local woman, but he’s still in contact with Alaric (Matthew Davis). Tyler (Michael Trevino) is once again human, but lives in constant fear of triggering his werewolf curse. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) chases random girls, plays video games, and seems to care little for anything but his own pleasure.Episode 1, “I’ll Remember,” spends a sizable amount of time recapping earlier events and acquainting viewers with what the characters have been up to since the other side disappeared. The episode disorients before the plot puzzle pieces are reassembled. The final scene is witty and intriguing as it sets up the questions that will be addressed during the season.The show derives its popularity from smoothly integrating horror, fantasy, and romance genres with a generous shot of soap opera melodrama. All 22 episodes of Season 6 are included on the 4-disc Blu-ray release.

"“Lost After Dark” is for folks who love those 1980s slasher flicks, whether well made or schlocky. This film uses familiar elements of 80s horror to get the tone just right. It’s the high school Spring Ball, 1984. Adrienne (Kendra Timmins), a straight-A student, joins her quarterback boyfriend Sean (Justin Kelly) and some friends in sneaking out of the school dance to spend time at her cabin. Their party plans hit an obstacle when they run out of gas on a deserted road. Heading out on foot, they discover a rundown farmhouse where they hope to find help. Instead they find themselves at the mercy of Junior Joad (Mark Wiebe), a cannibal killer from an urban legend. After the brutal murder of one of their friends, the group’s quest for help becomes one of desperation and survival.Clearly, director Ian Kessner is a fan of 80s-era horror, since he gets nearly everything right, including simulated splices, scratches, and reel changes (which occur only at the beginning). Those who know the genre will see references to “Friday the 13th,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” “He Knows You’re Alone,” “Maniac,” “Mother’s Day,” “Prom Night,” and many others. The script works as both an homage to the past and an addition to the genre.The movie never achieves the status of a “Psycho,” but that’s part of the fun. These slasher films were turned out practically weekly in attempts to duplicate the impressive box office of “Friday the 13th” and “Halloween.” They were embraced by those who liked their horror bloody and graphic, and “Lost After Dark” caters to the same audience.Unlike the characters in “Scream,” those in “Lost After Dark” are not horror-flick savvy, so they don’t comment on their predicament with references to horror films. They are unaware of potential danger and make all the wrong decisions — just like typical 80s horror movie teens.There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTN446GEX4UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T2TBS0#wasThisHelpful","R2VTN446GEX4UJ","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Mad Max: Fury Road” is a 21st-century look back to the original “Mad Max” starring Mel Gibson. This one stars Tom Hardy as the title character, who is actually more supporting player than lead character. That honor goes to Charlize Theron, who plays the one-armed warrior Imperator Furiosa, a tough gal in the mold of Ripley from the “Alien” movies. She’s adept at hand-to-hand combat and is also pretty formidable behind the wheel of her big rig truck or wielding all manner of weaponry.When we first see him, Max, bound by a metal face device and utilized as a human blood supply, is a prisoner of the War Boys of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Initially enemies, Max and Furiosa eventually become allies against a mutual foe and a grudging respect develops between them.The first half-hour of the film is essentially a chase, with an assortment of cars, trucks, motorcycles, and crazed War Boys wildly shooting flame throwers, lobbing hand grenades, and jumping, like pirates, from one vehicle to the next. The extended sequence is beautifully filmed and exciting to watch. Director George Miller knows how to tell his simple story in visual terms, downplaying dialogue for fear of bogging down the picture’s rocket-like pace. Nicholas Hoult (“Warm Bodies,” “X-Men: Days of Future Past”) co-stars as a wild-eyed, maniacal War Boy who joins the cause of decency and is driven more by conscience than testosterone as one new danger after another manifests itself.  Max and Furiosa are hard-as-nails fighters who hold on to their humanity in a world where savagery and rampant violence are the norm.The 3D effects are pretty cool, with projectiles, fists, vehicles and everything else zooming toward the camera. In addition to its gimmickry, the 3D gives the road scenes a sense of depth, emphasizing the nearly endless expanse of flat, desert. Bonus extras on the 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include several behind-the-scenes featureless.

"We have a dog -- a shepherd mix -- who sheds quite a bit. It's always a task to keep the floors clean of dog hair, so we thought this product sounded good. Assembly was fairly easy (the handle comes in segments, probably to make shipping easier). We expected it to work better than a standard broom, and it does. It nicely pushes dog hair into a pile for easy pick up. A standard broom merely moves the hair all around.Frankly, we prefer a recharchable vacuum for this task, since it's more thorough, but for quick jobs, this product is handy and convenient. To clean furniture, it was more convenient for us to remove two of the handle sections. This made maneuvering the broom on the couch and easy chairs more manageable. The broom worked effectively on our hardwood floors. It was less efficient on carpeting, where traditional vacuuming did the job better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZ1W6IE3ANI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQNI99O#wasThisHelpful","RHZ1W6IE3ANI7","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Walking Dead: The Complete Fifth Season” begins with the outstanding episode, “No Sanctuary,” one of the most action-packed, bloodiest of the series. Season 4 concluded with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and the group outnumbered, outgunned, and trapped in a shipping container at the mercy of Gareth and his band of cannibals. The outlook was bleak.Apart from season opening and finale episodes, the shows too often lapse into long, talky sequences that slow the pace and kill suspense. The show is about humans defending themselves from becoming zombie meals, but we have back stories, conflicts, and assorted treks to supposedly safe locations.Special effects are the best on television, easily ranking with what you can see in Hollywood features. The producers keep coming up with new and ghastly images, and I suppose that’s what keeps viewers coming back. It’s tough sustaining any series for more than three seasons, especially one whose goal is shocking viewers. Even deaths of key characters have become predictable, occurring for the most part in season finales. Still, despite these shortcomings, “The Walking Dead” is a gruesomely effective horror series.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include several behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentaries, and deleted scenes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHH8AJJYA01D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGQKBQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3UHH8AJJYA01D","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Sender” is a well crafted psychological horror film. Zeljko Ivanek (TV’s “Damages”) stars as John Doe #83, a patient admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. When the psychiatrist assigned to his case, Dr. Gail Farmer (Kathryn Harold of TV’s “The Rockford Files”), begins experiencing vivid hallucinations, she suspects that she may be telepathically connected to her new patient, envisioning what he is experiencing in real time.Produced by the same studio that, two years earlier, introduced the world to the “Friday the 13th” franchise, “The Sender” relies less on gory murders and amped suspense than gradual, escalating horror. From the gripping opening scene, in which a man loads himself down with rocks and walks into a lake, the movie holds our attention. Why is he trying to kill himself? Does he have telepathic powers? Are they blessing or curse?Director Roger Christian and a uniformly strong cast make “The Sender” a surprising low-budget horror film that stands out from the numerous slasher films produced during the 1980s. Rather than rely on gallons of stage blood and dumb, hormone-driven teenagers, it draws upon mental illness and the mysteries of the human mind for its thrills.

"“Citizenfour” is a real-life thriller that unfolds in gripping minute-by-minute fashion. Director Laura Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald met with whistleblower Edward Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel room as he handed over classified documents that provided evidence of mass, indiscriminate, illegal invasions of privacy by our National Security Agency.The documentary explores the dangers of unchecked governmental surveillance, revealing how our phones, e-mails, credit cards, and web browsers are not as secure and private as we thought. It reveals how government agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and NSA go through all of our records, looking for certain buzzwords. If they’re found in your communications, you get earmarked for scrutiny and possible harassment.When Poitras and Greenwald first meet with Snowden, they don’t even know his name. After Greenwald publishes the story of Snowden’s exile with help from media outlets in Great Britain and Brazil, other reporters join the U.S. government in looking for him. Poitras’ camera captures his evasions and disguises as Snowden searches for a country that will grant him asylum. The documentary plays like a Hollywood spy film as it exposes the lengths to which the United States will go to capture Snowden and put him on trial for treason.In a post-9/11 world, some may argue that the collection of data on a mass scale is necessary to find and stop potential terrorist threats to American citizens. Others may maintain that government must not circumvent the Constitution. Poitras leaves conclusions to the viewer. The film itself —  a testament to First Amendment rights — is the 2014 Academy Award winner for Best Documentary Feature.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes; New York Times talk with Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, Edward Snowden and David Carr; Film Society of Lincoln Center Q & A with Laura Poitras; and “The Program,” a New York Times Op-Doc by Laura Poitras.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBO9HZHH7B0KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIFBF6M#wasThisHelpful","RBO9HZHH7B0KZ","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Where Hope Grows” is a variation on the melodrama about excessive drinking. Calvin Campbell (Kristoffer Polaha) was a high school baseball star who blew his chance with the Major Leagues when a panic attack caused him to freeze up at home plate. Now, he spends his days drinking with his buddies and has little to do with raising his teenage daughter, Katie (McKaley Miller).During his daily liquor runs to a local convenience store, Calvin befriends Produce (David DeSanctis), a young man with Down syndrome. Produce’s simple, faith-based outlook on life cuts through Calvin’s boozy haze and he resolves to turn his life around.Like a Lifetime or Hallmark movie, “Where Hope Grows” is marked by excessive sentimentality. The dramatic spark is Calvin’s desire to forge a better relationship with Katie and to be a part of her life. Self-pity, however, impedes that goal. Produce’s cheerful life and love of his job motivate Calvin to snap out of his self-imposed gloom and seek redemption.The premise is overly familiar and the infusion of faith into Calvin’s life is awkwardly contrived. DeSanctis, however, delivers a standout performance with a genuine portrayal of a life-affirming individual whose condition hasn’t dampened his spirit one iota.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, audio commentary with director and writer, and a feature about the casting of David DeSanctis. A digital HD copy is enclosed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRX4MH8WX6ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPH4SAQ#wasThisHelpful","RDRX4MH8WX6ZN","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Berry Gordy’s The Last Dragon” is celebrating its 30th anniversary with this first-time-on-Blu-ray release. The film is a potpourri of styles: martial arts, blaxploitation, romance, and musical all rolled into one.Leroy Green, aka “Bruce Leroy” (Taimak), dreams of becoming a great martial artist like his idol, Bruce Lee. He searches for the “master” to obtain the ultimate level of martial arts expertise, known as “the glow.” Along the way, he must face off with an evil martial arts expert and rescue a beautiful singer from an obsessed music promoter.Living on the rough streets of New York City, Leroy endures considerable teasing for living by Bruce Lee’s teachings. When the gang lord Sho’nuff (Julius Carry) begins a reign of terror and challenges Leroy for the title of martial arts grand master, the confrontation leads to plenty of action. But Leroy has a pretty full plate. He also comes to the rescue of music video show host Laura (Vanity), who is being pressured by an unscrupulous music promoter (Chris Murney) to air his girlfriend’s video.“The Last Dragon” is an odd but entertaining blend of styles. Taimak has charm and scenes such as his eating popcorn in a movie theatre with chopsticks are amusing contrasts to the action scenes. With Berry Gordy’s name in the title, you can be sure of a cool soundtrack, including songs by DeBarge, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Rockwell.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette with cast and crew interviews, commentary by director Michael Schultz, and theatrical trailer. Also enclosed is a digital HD copy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BW9DAVN96UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE1K12W#wasThisHelpful","R25BW9DAVN96UC","A1KMG1AIUS00DC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KMG1AIUS00DC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing is HUGE!  Plenty of room in it for notebooks, regular books, etc.  My son puts his regular size flip open notebook, a tablet, 2-3 school books, all of his papers, etc.  Two things we've noted so far.  The material catches on velcro and gets 'fuzzed' so if you're sticking this into some other bag that has velcro straps, they'll make it look bad.  My son's main backpack compartment has a laptop sleeve with a velcro strap that rubs it.  Also the ring part is so big you can't use a spiral bound notebook in it without removing the spiral.Other than those minors, you can put everything in the universe in this and zip it up.  I bought this ahead of the first day of fifth grade and by the next week many of the other kids had them too.  The ones that got the velcro strap enclosure version or an open 3 ring binder come out the door dropping everything on the ground as they go.  Its nicely padded and well made.

"Edit: dropped to one star.  After 3 weeks the bulb had lost 90% of its brightness.  Probably something to do with the smell the bulb gave off through the first week.I've put a few bulbs in my 73"" set.  The original bulb went well past its rated hours and still worked, but was pretty dim.  I replaced it with another official expensive factory replacement and it was like a new tv again.Its been almost 2 years of heavy use and was starting to get a little dim.  I saw this bulb and figured for under twenty bucks it was worth a try.First off, it came in the identical box the factory replacement bulb came in, and wrapped inside in exactly the same manner.  The only difference I could see between the two is that his bulb came with flathead thumbscrews (which suck by the way) instead of phillips head.  Its practically impossible to get your fingers into the area to place the thumbscrews and of course a flathead screw won't sit on a screwdriver and let you insert it that way.Removal and installation are very simple.  I removed the two screws and the small plastic panel covering the bulb (on the back of the tv at the bottom on the left side), removed the two screws holding the bulb, slide the old out and the new in and reverse the process.  I did vacuum and blow some dust out of the bulb area before installing the new bulb.If you touch the bulb (anything other than the black plastic) the transfer of oils from your finger to the bulb will cause it to blow immediately or in a fairly short while.  Wear rubber gloves and avoid touching the bulb or laying the bulb where it'll touch and pick up anything.The new bulb smelled a little burned-electronics for about 30 minutes which the original and first replacement didn't do.  Some kind of residue.Anyhow it looked identical to the original and factory replacement, fit perfectly fine, just scavenge the thumb screws from the original bulb and toss the flathead versions unless you have tiny fingers or one of those bit heads that can hold a flat head screw securely while you put it in.I'll report back if the bulb suffers a short life or I have other issues with it.  But at this price and for how easy it is to replace, unless it pops in under 6 months I'll be happy.  If there are no further reports then it lasted as long as can be expected.  I suspect the people who had the bulb pop or not last long touched it with their fingers or rested it on something.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155S27K1IY2BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8D6MBU#wasThisHelpful","R155S27K1IY2BB","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The price was right for this (under five) so I gave it a shot.  Its definitely a Samsung product, so reviews that say otherwise either aren't looking at the packaging or they mistakenly received something else.Oddly, the packaging description is incomplete.  It states on the back ""provides exceptional protection from without forfeiting style""  From what is a good question.  I'm guessing the people putting the statement together were indecisive about what they wanted to formally state the case would protect against and then forgot to go back and fill it in.The case itself is thin, hard on the back, rubbery/siliconey on the sides/rim.  It doesn't significantly change the size of the phone.  It offers rim protection on the screen face that'd let you lay it face down without scratching but I'm 99% sure that if you drop it face down it'd offer little to no protection.  Side drops might survive.  Back drops would be iffy as its just a thin plastic back about the same thickness as the battery cover under it.The case has a little static charge most of the time, so everything sticks to it and on the white case, everything shows.All I wanted was minimal case protection and a better grip without making the device even bigger than it already is.

"I bought this opener roughly 7 years ago.  I was looking for a pair of new remotes and an outdoor keypad for my existing opener, then realized that those 3 things cost close to the price of this opener which was on sale with free installation.Its much quieter than the 19 year old screw driver unit and opens/closes the door quickly.  That's the good part.  Now for the bad parts based on long term ownership.The battery dies after about four years.  That's $25 to replace.  Then all of a sudden none of the remotes, including the keypad, would open the door reliably or at any sort of distance.  I tried changing the batteries to no avail, then looked it up.  Seems a lot of people have these problems and blame it on the remote losing power.  Since I had 3 remotes all suddenly not want to open the door, I knew it wasn't the remote.Some fix it by extending the antenna wire out to the door or outside through a wall or vent.  But it appears that the internal circuit board has lost its sensitivity.  Chamberlain says it was due to voltage spikes and it needed a surge protector.  My other now 26 year old opener still works beautifully, and most of my neighbors still have both original 25-26 year old Genie's.  So either Genies are made to take a power spike or (much more likely) Chamberlain uses cheap capacitors to save a few cents.  Its $70 for a replacement board, although it fails often enough that there are a number of youtube video's that show how to replace it.The sensitivity of the wall plate that senses motion and turns the lights on also fades when the remote control sensitivity does.Nice quiet fast GDO, but you'll spend $100 on batteries and $240 on logic boards over a 20 year life span.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2MZ3QRVGMX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071JJBOE#wasThisHelpful","R3S2MZ3QRVGMX2","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The echo very quickly melded with my family.  Its the quick and easy to-do and shopping list creator.  I used to keep lists out the wazoo and then forget to bring them with me when I shopped.  Now I have a sync'd to-do list and shopping list on my phone and all of my devices.  The microphones are very good!  I have a 2500 square foot 2 story house and I can talk to Alexa from anywhere on the first floor or yell down the stairs to her, she gets it right most of the time.  Its cool to be able to ask for simple things like ""how many tablespoons is 6 teaspoons?"" or ""set a timer for 20 minutes?"" or ""What is 568 divided by 14?"" when I'm washing something in the sink or have dirty hands.And music?  I'm often fiddling around in the house and being able to ask it to play a particular type of music while I work and get commercial free play is wonderful.  I listen to far more music.Downsides?  Its big and really requires some central placement.  No shoving it under a cabinet behind some boxes.  The audio quality seems more $99ish than $199ish.  The bluetooth audio isn't as crisp as streamed audio due to compression/codecs but that's true of all bluetooth speakers.  But its no big deal, I have a nice spot on my counter and I'm not an uber audio quality nerd, so I'm perfectly pleased with it.I do have trouble sometimes remembering that she's a robot.  I still say ""please"" and ""thank you""!I leave the remote control upstairs so I can easily add things to my lists or get some music playing without having to yell down the stairs.  I can see how a couple of remotes distributed throughout a household would help extend the capabilities.  It'd be nice to be able to have 2 or 3 of them and have them sync'd to play the same music throughout the household or to use them as an intercom type system to talk to others.My son thoroughly enjoys using the remote with the ""simon says"" capability to say funny things to me when I'm downstairs.The best part is that Alexa keeps getting new features all the time, and it can grow into an even more powerful product as the software improves.I'll be very happy when I can call it Jarvis and it speaks with an English accent.

"Actually you can't, but understanding the enemy will help keep them out of your house and perhaps off your property.The small argentinian ant you're well familiar with if you live in California is different from most ant situations.  Most ants will fight with other similar type ant colonies, they live with one queen to a nest, and they'll often avoid repopulating a dead nest.Not these guys.  Most of them came from a single colony and so have the genetic marker that makes them think they're all from the same nest/colony.  Multiple queens will inhabit a nest.  And they have no problems with moving right back into a dead nest.  So the whole concept of 'killing the queen' or being rid of them is out the window.  In fact, once the queen is dead they'll go through a process of converting a hatchling to a new queen.They also maintain a scent trail that will last for many years, right into your kitchen, bathroom or other areas where they have previously found food/water and shelter from extreme weather.  They are very fond of driveways, crowns in the road and large concrete spans where they can be protected and avoid drowning in the rain.  When its hot out, your air conditioned house is a great place to be.This is a war of attrition, but I've 'won' that war on many properties.First thing you need to do is get rid of excess food and water sources outside.  I've seen them eat everything from fallen fruit to dog poop.Next when you see a line of ants, follow that trail to the furthest place away from your house you can locate and put one of these baits down.  Set it on the ground, pull out the stakes and press the top.  Don't try to do this while you're holding it unless you like getting it on your hands. Cover it with something to keep the sun off, unless its already in a shady place.  Stake it if necessary.  Monitor each one you put out to see if the ants are still feeding on it, its empty, or its dried out.  Keep replacing until you stop seeing the ants.I've tried every bait I could buy and frankly this is the only one they take to.  They've largely ignored everything else.  They certainly like proteins but aren't interested in protein baits.  I sometimes will put a little bit of pet food on top of the white crown, it does draw more ants in but they'll take the terro while they're there.This is basically sugar, water and boric acid.  The boric acid acts as a drying agent but it takes time to kill the ant.  So it can bring it back to the nest and feed it to the queen and the ant larvae.  Given enough of it, you will kill the nest, but as described above it'll be repopulated.I restrict using this to within about 15' of my house.  If you have lots of time, money and persistence you can drive them to the property boundaries.In the fall just before the real rain starts (hoping to see that again soon after 4 years of drought) get one of those water hose-screw-on insecticides that kills ants and spray all around your foundation for a few feet away from the house and a foot or so up the side of the house.  Spray the edges of all concrete including big cracks and seams.  In the spring once the rain is over but before the serious heat kicks in, do that spraying again.  I have a 2500 square foot house on 1/2 acre and this costs me about $50-75 a year for Terro and the spray.If they get into your house, resist the urge to vacuum them up.  Remove the food/water they were interested in and put a Terro bait at the nearest point of entry you can find.  I actually use these outdoor ones instead of the indoor ones.  Simpler and less messy, and they hold more.  Let them continue eating the bait until they're gone...which might take a week or more.  You'll see a pattern of lots of regular looking ants, then when those are all gone from the nest you'll see some burlier versions, about 1.5x the size and thicker.  These are the queens/nests guards who have come in search of food because the workers are gone.  You might even see the queen escorted to the food source, she'll be a lot bigger.  Then you'll see really small ones, these are the newly hatched and the last ditch effort to get food for the nest.Our objective here is to reduce the population and make the area immediately around your house unfriendly, and to prevent them from entering your house.  When it rains they'll migrate to a dry warm place with food.  When the real heat comes out and things dry up, they look for cooler surroundings with a water/food source.  After a few years of keeping them out, their scent trails that keep leading them into the house will no longer be effective and the job gets easier.After a few years I've found that they decide that my neighbors are less trouble than I am.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SF1JX91J5VVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q3QQNC#wasThisHelpful","R3SF1JX91J5VVE","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried a few call block products but found that they're incompatible with my uniden phone.  No caller ID is passed to the phone when its called no matter how I configure it.  Its just an Ooma Telo with a wire to the blocker and a wire from that to the phone.  Call Waiting ID passes, but not initial caller ID.I also found that the first two rings on a call are 'eaten' by the telo/sentry combo.  In other words, when someone calls your phone won't ring until the 3rd ring on the callers end.  This made for some issues with Ooma voicemail picking up the call before my home answering machine did.  And I've had a few instances where Google Voice voicemail picked up the call when people call my GV number that's forwarded to the Ooma.Deciding to live without callerID, knowing that only my whitelist calls (or persistent human callers) will get through, I kept the Sentry.I've been running it in ""off"" mode for about two weeks, Everyone I know has called and been added to the whitelist.  I blacklisted a handful of numbers that were autodialers.  In another week or so I'll turn the device ""on"" so it'll block all non whitelisted calls with the voice recording to press a number to get through. I had such a setup built into a VOIP phone system from AT&T about ten years ago and it was extremely effective.  Not only did I never get a telemarketer or political call, once that system had been in place for a year they simply stopped calling.  I must have landed on a lot of ""never answers"" lists.Simple, easy to use.  Mine came with no cords/cables which wasn't a problem for me as I have a hundred phone cords, but it seemed silly to save 50c and not include one.  The instructions sheet was also minimal, but a full manual is available online.I'll report back once I've had a month or so of ""on"" operation.

"My first impressions weren't good.  ""Holy cow, this thing is too big and too heavy!"".  I was going to return it.  Then I used it for two days.  Without hooking it to a charger and still had 48% power.  It made the phone easier to pick up and hold, although it feels like you have a brick in your pocket and the handy 'phone pocket' in my pants is too small for it to fit.This basically changed the way I used my phone.  I used to have it hooked to the charger when I wasn't actively using it.  Now I can leave it on the  table next to the couch in the living room (no ac outlets) and use it all day as a remote control for all my toys.  And if I forget to plug it in before bed, it doesn't really matter.  It took about 2 hours to not even notice the size and weight and actually see them as an advantage.Multiple batteries and car chargers work for a lot of people.  I hate prying the back off the phone to switch up and carrying little plugs when I travel.  An external battery works, but I like how easy this has made it to pick up the phone vs my skinny old phone, and I like how easy it makes to hold it","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V7FM40L0Z7Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYEMNA6#wasThisHelpful","R3V7FM40L0Z7Q7","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to use quicken years ago and it was wonderful for tracking finances, automatically downloading my brokerage and banking data, and doing practically pushbutton taxes at the end of the year with turbotax.I'd gotten away from it for some years due to the incessant forced upgrades and pushing for revenues.  I've just been using my couch potato portfolio and watching my bank account, and having an annoying tax day once a year.I recently started using Mint, a free finance product that was bought by Intuit, the maker of quicken.  I was surprised at how quickly it could marshall up my current finances and transactions, sort the latter into categories with 98% accuracy and tell me what I was spending money on and how.  Very simple interface.  There were just a few more things I wanted, like for it to download more than 18 months worth of data, perhaps find the cost basis for investments, and do more processing on my Lending Club account.  I can see data to either 1993 or 1998 at my brokerage and they have cost basis information available for viewing.So I tried Quicken 2015.  Which was a mistake and if I could give it back for a refund I would.  It actually does less than Mint in many areas.  Specifically it didn't label my accounts (ex: calling my Discover card 'credit card 123456789' instead of 'discover'), it failed to categorize a lot more expenses and transactions, it didn't download any more of the available data (which may be my brokerages limitation), and it didn't even download my Lending Club transactions while Mint did.I know Quicken is very powerful and the ideal tool for people who like to get down in the weeds on their financial transactions, but I just expected it to be much more than Mint in every way and its not.If someone has a way to screen scrape vanguard for all of my data and get it into a format quicken will import, I'd be appreciative.  All of my significant financial information is there and I can see it, but it has names of funds/stocks/bonds instead of symbols and what they report is erratic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVTZXZZJRM9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9GTL6M#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVTZXZZJRM9W","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had one of these for more than 20 years.  In that time, one of the plastic teeth that engages the bowl has broken off.  That will happen if you dont hold the lid down tight while pulling the cord.  After washing the salad, place the bowl on a towel on the counter, hold the lid down (and the spinner) firmly and pull the cord gently with the other until the salad is dry.If you put the lid on and pull the string hard without holding the lid down, I can see how it would break.

"I have an older tamarack whole house fan which just doesn't move enough air.  I use this fan to supplement it when the hotter weather comes in.  It moves considerably more air than the 1200cfm tamarack fan.  I was initially concerned about the huge dimensions as I have casement sliding windows.  No problem, I can turn it on its side and adjusted it to fill the sliding portion of the window.  While I was test fitting it, I saw that I could tuck the 'top' part behind the mounting for the wood blind and the bottom on the sill and it'd stay there just fine.  I can slide the window open and closed with it sitting there and remove it in the winter by just pulling it out.  I've never used the screws or mountings.The reversible aspect is great.  Once I've drawn most of the warm air out of the house I can reverse it and pull cool night air into the bedroom where its mounted  Normally I'd have to run air conditioning from late April to late October, but this lets me get away with cooling the house in the evening with the fan at 1/10th the cost of air conditioning.In fact, I just bought a second one to speed the process and distribute the air flow.  Under $150 for a load of bi-directional whole house air circulation with 5 minutes of free and easy installation works for me.Its not a small or thin or unobtrusive fan.

"The little plastic cover swings down to protect the smaller microusb connection.  It works with windows, mac's and SOME android devices.On the android end, you need a newer version of android, the hardware capability to do ""on the go"" connections and the drivers on your phone or tablet.  There are some otg compatibility testers and some otg helpers in the Play store that can tell you (a little unreliably) if your android device will work with an otg flash device like this and help you mount it.  I'll say again that the helpers and compatibility testers aren't 100% reliable.If you have a brand spanking new flagship phone, it'll probably work.  Not any of the Fire devices I have will mount it, the phone, the fire 6 and the 7"" hdx don't work.There is also a form factor issue with this product.  On the underside where you can't see right under the swivel for that plastic cover is a little keychain ring. If you have a thick protective cover on your tablet or phone, this prevents the drive from getting all the way in.  You can either nip it off with a tool or make a little groove in your cover.

But it doesn't work on half of my devices and won't fit in most of the rest without a field modification.  The OTG compatibility isn't the devices fault but the keyring thing is a real problem.

"The M1 Gaming Mouse comes attractively packaged with an actual manual and a cd containing Windows XP/Vista/7/8 software.  The cd is a 'mini' disc, probably to allow packaging in a box smaller than would be required for a full size disk.  The manual is 10 pages in color and in readable English.  It adequately describes how to install the product, its software and how to operate it.The mouse is extremely glossy, in fact you'll see my reflection in the photo I took of it.  In the photo it looks like the mouse is silvery, but its solid black.  I've also added a photo of the main menu of the configuration software.  It fits my hand well, and I have medium size hands.  My ten year old son has also used it and says it feels fine for his size hands.  Its rounded in the back and all angles from the middle forward.  I have an expensive 7000 series Microsoft laser mouse which cost around 3x what the M1 goes for.  The buttons on the Microsoft mouse seem a bit firmer and sturdier, but only when I have one in each hand.  Separately, its a minor difference.  The M1 has more raised surface for gliding on the bottom than the MS one.  The M1 is perfectly symmetrical, so it could be used right or left handed, while the MS mouse is right handed only.Its a corded mouse, which is prized by gamers for being more accurate and with no wireless response lag or interference.  The cord is covered with a braided fabric cover, which looks a little better than a plastic one.  It has a number of LED lights, which can be configured for color and solid/slow pulse.The mouse is plug and play with Windows 7, but you can load the optional software for configuration purposes.  You may change what each button does, assign macro's to each button, and there are multiple profiles so you can set up buttons/macro's for a particular game or app.  You may also cycle through the various profiles by assigning that function to one of the buttons, so within the same game/app where you'd like different capabilities depending on the circumstances, you can employ a different profile with a click.There are also advanced settings that let you fiddle with polling rate, DPI, sensitivity and so forth.  Highly configurable.We'll try this out with the usual load of games we play, like Skyrim and Arkham Asylum, along with every day app use.  I'll update if I find any issues or with any compliments about particular observations.  Otherwise, looks like a well priced, highly configurable, well functioning product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8LYK5HP37S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZENXVA#wasThisHelpful","RC8LYK5HP37S1","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This remote allows you to turn the xbox one on and off, navigate the basic menu's, and control media playback.  I use my XB1 as a blu ray player, and its annoying to go to pause a movie and see that the controller has powered off.  I have a media remote for my 360 and PS3, so I figured I'd get one for the XB1 for non gaming purposes.It fits in the palm of your hand and all buttons are within a thumbs reach.  Its not beautifully crafted from the finest Corinthian leather, its just inexpensive plastic.  It is an infrared remote so it has to be pointed at the xbox.  Xbox one controllers use wireless and this is different from that, so range and where you point matters.  I've found it reaches about 12' with a new pair of AAA batteries, which were not included.Controlling the tv?  There aren't any facilities to train the remote, so I believe the tv control part works only if you have a Kinect, which the Xbox one uses to control channel and volume on a tv.  You'd press a button on the remote, the XB1 would see it and tell the Kinect to send an IR signal to the tv and that's probably how that works.  I don't have a kinect so I can't test it right now.I found the buttons worked pretty much all the time and didn't require any special effort to work.  I've also seen the 'real' microsoft remote and it doesn't seem any fancier or better working than this one, but the 'real' one costs a lot more.So if you want a cheap remote to basically hit pause and play and turn the XB1 on and off, this is well recommended.

"Lets talk about the halo effect.  The halo effect is caused when a pretty person says something that fits your confirmation bias.  A confirmation bias is when someone tells you in great detail and with strong effect something you already suspect is true.  Whether it is true or not doesn't matter.  The halo effect has an attractive person confirming your beliefs or your fears about things like ground up yoga mats in your food.A word about the 'blowing agents', which have been used to create air bubbles in foods, rubber seals and yes, yoga mats.  You aren't eating rubber, you aren't eating yoga mat.  You're eating food which contained (note past tense) a chemical that created a airiness and bubbles in a piece of bread and left behind nothing harmful whatsoever. Carbon dioxide bubbles are also used for industrial purposes.  Will you never drink soda or any other carbonated drink again because its also used as a tertiary scrub for oil fields to increase yields?  Of course not.  Yet, it wouldn't be ridiculous to apply the same logic set and have a pretty blogger with a computer background print a headline that says ""Oil in your cola!""Blowing agents cause airway inflammation in factory workers manufacturing or using large amounts of the product who don't wear masks.  So does baby powder.  ""Baby powder will kill you!""The blowing agents were made 'illegal' in some countries because when presented with a PR nightmare and alternatives not used for other nefarious purposes like baby food jar seals...Parliament decided to go the easy route and order a change.  But all products on the shelf or in warehouses (including baby food) could continue to be sold until it was exhausted.  Which took up to 2 years.  The 'babes' were advised not to push the issue further, because in an actual court using actual facts, the ingredient would be shown to be completely safe and they'd look stupid.  But in the public mind they could use factless negative PR to get people to pay them $18 a month for stuff they could get for free somewhere else.This is what happens when you leverage fear among people who don't know the science and won't become their own 'investigators', and the person doing the investigation is not only not a scientist, but also not an effective investigator.  Its what you get when you're an advocate not backed up with associated expertise.Its a shame because there really are a lot of things wrong with our food and our health advice.  She just doesn't choose to go after those.Bear in mind, this is someone who once noted that world governments are conspiring with drug companies to control the population with flu shots.  If that's the sort of thing you believe, then you're already completely doomed.  I don't think it even makes it as a 1960's 007 movie plot.  Not even Sean Connery could pull that one off.I believe that influential people who aren't scientists or researchers can bring together those scientists and researchers to help regular people understand the facts about health and nutrition, even when the mainstream may not be giving the best advice.  But when you leave out the people who actually know something, or rely on the deep fringe to give the influencer their own confirmation bias...no good will come of it.Bill Nye is not a scientist.  But he has a knack for explaining science to other people with the support of a wide range of actual scientists with real credentials.As far as confirmation bias, I'm sure that you can Google almost anything and get a handful of results in support of your thoughts.  Hitler was really Elvis.  Dogs can fly.  Google also tends to give you more of what you've been looking at and as much highly correlated and related page results based on your history.  So if you're someone that often looking up things that are a little 'out there', Google will work hard to give you more of what you want.  After all, if they just said ""no results"" when you asked if the mafia really controls all world governments, you'd change to Bing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KCGVP41T4VCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PXW1NY#wasThisHelpful","R3KCGVP41T4VCH","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find Asics gel-33 shoes to be very comfortable.  I bought a pair a couple of years ago and find myself going to those over my other sneaks.  Soft comfortable sole insert and a very generous heel padding.  But my old ones were wearing out and nobody carried that model anymore.  They were gel-33 type shoes though, so I took a shot at the 'nerve' versionHonestly they fit and feel exactly the same, although they're a bit lighter.  I wasn't entirely thrilled with the pictures but I like the style fine in real life.  I've worn them two days in a row, the break in took about an hour.  Its nice to know I can stick with the various gel-33 models and still get the comfort I like.

"This is a really nice leash.  Its 8' long, while many dual handles are 6.  This gives my dogs a little more room to roam which is nice considering I'm walking two large dogs.  The closer handle is about 18"" from the clip.  The leash material is heavy braided nylon strapping and is at least 4x as heavy duty as the strap in my 140lb-rated retractable leash.  I have absolutely no worries about the quality or expected life span of this leash.Each handle has an extra perforated leather or leather like layer on the inside.  Its soft and comfortable.

"This is your basic one piece non hard plastic case.  The phone goes in easily enough and would come out without too much trouble but not on its own.  Good fit, plenty of room for button and charger access, no blocking at all.  Semi flexible but not a silicone soft.  Protects the screen when placed face down as there is a little lip that would keep the screen off the table.  Good protection for the back and all four sides.  Wouldn't save the phone from a high drop onto concrete, but nothing would without adding a lot more bulk.I bought a holster case for the Fire Phone and this case fits the holster.  I like the protection on this one so I'll keep them both and use this case inside the holster from the other one.Edit: after using this case for about a month I'm very happy with it.  It still fits perfectly and has offered excellent protection and a better grip than the bare phone.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFZZ2E6/","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11X5W3AF1SYL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU1Q0LG#wasThisHelpful","R11X5W3AF1SYL8","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about this one.  The case portion is hard plastic and doesn't offer a lot of top and bottom protection.  It slides easily in and out of the holster part and the cutouts are spot on.  The holster part is really nice.  The good part is that the fosmon case I also bought offers better protection and it also fits in the holster.  In fact, just about any form fit case should fit the holster.The little pop out stand really isn't that hard to get out, but it needed a little extra pressure to go back in.  One side seated and the other side stuck.  Perfectly stable and I'd expect it to break off within a year or two because it doesn't seem that sturdy.I got this for an excellent price.  The iphone version was selling for 2.5x as much and has thousands of solid reviews.  I like it and will keep it in combination with the fosmon case.  Keeps the phone handy and from being sat on if I forget its in my pocket.  But the included case portion wouldn't offer any protection for a top or bottom drop.Edit: After using it for a few days, I think my use for this is going to be limited.  Its pretty large and pretty heavy.  Hung on a pocket it a sticks out and its pretty heavy and bulky.  On my belt it sticks up under my shirt and is a bit challenging to get out because the phone is pretty long.  I've used it on dog walks where I have a leash in each hand and I want the phone to take a picture of something, but in everyday use the vertical holster is just a bit unwieldy.  Nicely made product and a lot for the price if its really the sort of case/holster you want.Edit #2: Thanks to a commenter, I see that the holster clasp pivots so the holster can be horizontal or almost any position in between.  See the comments for details.Nice little holster for five ninety nine.  Works great with the fosmon case that offers more protection and I got the pair for under ten bucks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SMOY1OCS99IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFZZ2E6#wasThisHelpful","R1SMOY1OCS99IL","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally your various mass market food purveyors overplay their ""crazy spicy flaming chicken sandwich"" or ""insanely hot salsa"" so when I saw this say it was crazy hot, I rolled my eyes.As I explained to my 10 year old when I was opening it ""If they make it too hot then many people won't be able to eat it and they might not buy it again"".  I've said stupid and largely incorrect things many times in my life, and this was no exception.I have to say it has a nice flavor.  For 5 seconds.  Then the heat kicks in.  I know that many people have varying response to capsaicin.  But I normally eat a lot of pretty spicy food and I can tolerate it very well.  This stuff is hot.  Really, really hot.The good news is that after the first one, the next 8-10 chiploads aren't as bad, probably due to the class 12 chemical burns on your tongue.

"I put this inside my directv hr24-100 dvr as a replacement for its 5 year old drive.  Not the easiest thing I've done as it requires popping numerous delicate plastic prongs to remove the top and the carrier the disk is in is also extremely fragile plastic and has screws on the bottom side that are hard to access.  However I managed it in about 30 minutes and only cracked one non essential plastic piece.Directv doesn't want you meddling inside the boxes, but they haven't wanted this model receiver returned for quite some time as its getting a little older.  The only major risk is that you break it and have to pay for a new one.The 2TB's of storage is way better than the 500GB drive it came with.  Its the maximum an HR24 series dvr can address.  The genie models can go higher, however.The drive is quiet, cool running, and other than giving me a lot more storage space is indistinguishable from the original.You could put the drive into an external case and connect it via e-sata but I've had no end of problems with that when used with a handful of recommended cases.  The drive disconnects, sometimes there are performance related issues, and every other time the dvr was rebooted or I had a power failure it'd come up on the internal drive and I'd have to reboot it again.  Once we had a power outage in the middle of the night and I didn't know it'd happened and missed a whole days worth of shows.  These problems disappeared when I popped the same drive inside the dvr.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXA1OPULQTI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042AG9V8#wasThisHelpful","RUXA1OPULQTI1","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These arrived fast with a nice note encouraging me to call them if there were any problems.The cases are a firmer plastic than the usual squishy silicone ones, but not hard plastic.  They have a little 'give' and provide rear/side/front edge protection.  They don't cover the screen but it does wrap around from the bottom and sides to make a 'lip' around the screen edge.  So you can put the phone face down and the screen won't touch the surface the phone is on.The fit was perfect.  Its very nice to have a collection of cases in different colors for such a low cost.  I had a similar softer silicone case, but it didn't fit as well as this and that one case cost me about the same amount last year.I also applied one of the included screen protectors.  It went on pretty easily with a few small bubbles that I worked out to the edges.  The fit was precise and it looks good as well.Protection-wise, I'd think if you dropped the phone from 4-5' up onto concrete you might have a broken phone.  But other than that this should protect against minor drops, scratches and scrapes just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HN3EYIYPSJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPFQPS6#wasThisHelpful","R29HN3EYIYPSJG","A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd have rated this tablet higher back when it came out, but at point its a little slow and the new 'sangria' OS hasn't made it to this older tablet, if it ever will.  That's a little disappointing because it hasn't been discontinued for long.  For a company trying to push their own private ecosystem, you really have to do a bit more while you're still in the 'catching on' phase.The screen is beautiful, the network performance is very good, but the performance drags a little compared to my fire phone and its good for a hard freezeup about once or twice a week, requiring a reboot.I didn't pay much for this, about a quarter of what the new HDX costs, but I still have a little occasional buyers remorse.  In the 8.9 HDX price range, there are a lot of competitive tablets without the specter of losing updates.

"I've had a few of these for a couple of years, along with the 'bento bowl' and the large blue treat 'ball'.  The problem with the fire plug is that if you have a long nosed dog like a german shepherd, they'll figure out after a bit that they can chew sideways just under the rim and pop the treat out in 10 seconds.The blue 'ball' version is thicker between the treats while this slims between them, so that trick doesn't work with the ball.  Get that one if you have a dog with a long powerful jaw.  If your dog has a shorter nose, these will work.The bento bowl works well also, but it gives more access to the treat because the rubber portion is fairly small.  I haven't had the treat popped out of that one but it only lasts an hour or so while the treat in the blue 'ball' lasts for about 4-6 hours.I've had five large dogs chewing on these for years...a malamute, a rottweiller/mastiff mix, a pointer mix, a lab/pit bull and a german shepherd.  Plenty of tooth holes in the surface but no pieces torn off.I can get the treats into these just using my hands, but its hard.

"I was diagnosed by my doctor with a gluten intolerance about two years ago. I was experiencing a lot of digestive issues whenever I ate it. These cleared up once I eliminated gluten from my diet.But to be honest, I really missed the food (bread especially...GF bread is just not the same). I was really curious to see whether these digestive enzymes would make it possible for me to OCCASIONALLY indulge in the real thing.I personally had a good result using these. While I wasn't 100% symptom-free, I saw a major reduction in my normal symptoms (bloating, gas, constipation, and inflammation).Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, the next day, I ate the same item without the pill and I had my usual reaction to it.There is a little bit of trial and error when taking these. The instructions say that you can take 1-3 pills before you start eating gluten. Each pill covers you for 20g of gluten and lasts about 90 minutes. My problem is, I'm not sure how many grams of gluten are in some of the things I would want to eat (that type of information is not usually listed on the nutrition label). With trial and error, you can figure out the right dosage for your body and meal.I don't think you would want to pop these pills all the time, but they are helpful when a gluten-free option is not available (dinner out with friends, a holiday meal with family). They have enabled me to enjoy some of these foods I've missed without the digestive consequences.These are intended for those with a gluten intolerance, but not for those with Celiacs disease. If you have Celiacs, unfortunately, you have no option but to avoid gluten all together.Will I be using these everyday so that I can go back to my old way of eating....probably not, but I will definitely keep these on hand for special occasions  (hello, Thanksgiving dressing) or when I'm in a dining pinch. For me, they reduced my digestive symptoms by about 90%.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJOBBLQ1D58E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R1GJOBBLQ1D58E","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a number of baby carriers over the last six years (wraps, a few varieties of soft-structured carriers), but this is my first time using this style of carrier. I have actually really liked it. It was fairly easy to put on and take off by myself without any assistance. My child weighs just over 20 lbs at the moment. It felt about the same as wearing a heavy backpack. The shoulder straps are fairly well padded, but after wearing it for an extended amount of time, my shoulders were a little bit achey and I didn't feel like it offered a ton of support at my lower back.There is a buckle that goes across the hips to help displace the weight, but what this is seriously lacking is a chest strap. I'm not sure why it doesn't have one. It would certainly help displace the load and help to keep the carrier a bit more secure. The confusing thing is that the image on the inside of the attached Kelty brochure shows a woman wearing a carrier with chest strap (but this model doesn't include one).What I love:*I love the kickstand that makes it very easy to load and unload my child. (We've also used it as a make-shift chair at my son's flag football game).*The 5-point harness is fantastic. I feel confident that my child isn't going to fall (or crawl) out of the carrier while he's on my back.*The colors are nice and the fabric feels durable. The handles on the chair help make it easy to put on without assistance.What I don't like:*The lack of a chest strap/buckle*It can sometimes be challenging to fit the child's legs throught the leg holes due to the way the material/belt curves around the waist.*It does not fold compactly for storage.*It's ideal for short trips or errands, but it's not especially comfortable for longer treks.I've been pleased with this over all. My son absolutely loves riding in it. I'm sure it will fit different body types and heights differently (I'm 5'3). While it's not the world's most comfortable carrier, it's definitely not the most uncomfortable, and it's much cooler and more comfortable than wearing the soft-structured carriers on my back (plus I've never acquired the ability to put a child in a back soft-structured carrier by myself).It has some neat features that I would defintely recommend to other parents and caregivers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUYYJHD6Y0SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CXCHIY#wasThisHelpful","R2JUYYJHD6Y0SY","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:39 Mins As a family, we've been trying to cut down on some of the waste we create in our home. One way we're trying to do that is to eliminate the need for things like plastic wrap or foil. These Silicone Suction Lids have been a great and easy way for us to cut down our usage.I've found that the largest size works well for my serving bowls (things like vegetables, mashed potatoes, or rice). The medium bowl is a good size for soup/cereal bowls, and the smallest size is good for 2 cup prep bowls, mason jars, coffee mugs, or tea cups.We've started using these instead of plastic-wrap in the microwave. they're very easy to place on top of the bowl or dish and then heat up as usual. They can also be used in the oven up to 450 degrees, but we don't actually use much round bakeware, so these probably see the microwave a lot more often than the oven.We also use them for sealing and storing leftovers in the fridge. My one main criticism is that that seal is easily broken. If you have a dish in the refrigerator and the lid gets bumped by another item or as your shifting things around it's very easy for the lid to break the seal in shift. Also, you can't really stack things when using the lids because of the ridge from the handle. At the same time, the suction is strong enough for me to be able to lift the bowl up by the lid without it falling loose.These are easy to keep clean and to store. We actually keep these on top of our plastic wrap and foil boxes. I find that 8/10 we are able to use these lids instead of the foil or wrap. (I just need to acquire a rectangular lid for my 9x13 pans). They can go in the dishwasher, but I've found that it's often just as easy to give them a quick swipe with some dish soap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6L86IZGXRIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L291QVK#wasThisHelpful","R1U6L86IZGXRIW","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These dark wash boys denim shorts are a great length. I have to admit my favorite feature of these pants is the adjustable waist band. My son tends to have a rather thin waist and rear and pants typically seem to fall off of his frame. These feature an elastic band on the interior waistband that allow you to cinch the waist in and keep the shorts from falling down. This helps the pants continue to grow with my son which is fantastic from a mom's point of view.The denim seems to be high quality and the wash is nice and dark. I like that I can dress these up with a Polo shirt or a button-up or they can be very casual with a t-shirt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGN36CK0UVUDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKSIAYW#wasThisHelpful","RGN36CK0UVUDO","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We live in a very arid part of the country. The winters, in particular, are very dry. This is honestly, one of the best humidifiers I have tried. It has a very large tank and can run for days before it needs to be refilled.I did find that on the highest setting that it lasted for about 12 hours, There was so much moisture in the air that my carpet almost felt damp after running for that long. Most of the time though, I run it on the lowest setting. With a completely full tank, it does get pretty close to the 100 hours they advertise.I find the cool mist to be refreshing. Whenever my kids start coming down with a cough or a cold, I make sure that this is running in their room. I do think it has helped.I like the built in silver that helps keep things clean. This humidifier seems much easier to maintain than other models I've tried in the past. You basically just need to rinse and wipe out the tank and use a special included brush to clean the disc. This is so much easier than messing with filters.In case you are wondering, you cannot use any types of fragrances or oils with this humidifier. They will damage the unit. The mist can be directed to a certain direction by turning the disc on the top.The nightlight feature is handy for use in a kids room. You have the option of a light on the dial, or a light on the tank, or no light at all. I've found that the light on the tank almost is too bright for my kids at night, but it's very easy to toggle the light on or off. I also like that the light on the dial turns red whenever the water level is low.All-in-all this has been a great addition to our home. I'm tempted to get a second one for my other child's room so that I'd have one available for his use as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIBKLHL3CWUJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CFIK8O#wasThisHelpful","RIBKLHL3CWUJ4","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past few years I've been buying Charmin Ultra-strong, primarily because I wanted a toilet paper that wasn't going to fall apart when I used it.I have to admit, I think the Ultra-soft has won me over.

It feels a bit thicker than some other toilet papers I have tried in the past and it's definitely soft enough to use for blowing your nose as well (we often use toilet paper if we don't have a box of tissues in the house).The 24 pack is great because I know it will last my family for a while.

"To be honest, I'd didn't find this to be a particularly thrilling read. The premise is interesting enough- a family with the ability to travel back I'm time to visit different eras in history.Unfortunately, the delivery failed a bit. To me, it read more like a ""let's figure out how to teach the history of the park"" rather than something my kids want to read. Don't get me wrong, I wholeheartedly believe that things that are educational can also be entertaining, but I felt like this one missed the mark.The characters didn't have very much depth to them, they were essentially there to set the scene for the next lesson.If you're doing a study on the National Parks, then this could be a handy way to introduce new information, but if you're looking for a entertaining read for your child, you may want to keep looking (unless, of course, your child really digs the Great Smokey Mountain National Park).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7Y9PK1LMFK9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825307864#wasThisHelpful","R7Y9PK1LMFK9Z","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did the thing you're probably never supposed to do: I tried a new sunless tanner the night before I was in my sister's wedding.Although I wasn't 100% satisfied, I felt like it did a fairly good job. The color was reasonably natural. I applied it with the mitt. Although I didn't  necessarily have streaking, I did have some places that I did not adequately cover. It is kind of difficult to see where it has been applied. I thought I was thorough, but I still managed to miss a spot or two.My other recommendation is that you wait a while before applying clothes. I had a spot on my back where apparently the tanner rubbed off when I was pulling my shirt on. So wait until everything is COMPLETELY dry before crawling into bed or getting dressed.I did like that this did not have that nasty sunless tanner scent. It was not bad. You could totally go out after applying it.I still need to practice a bit more before I will be 100% satisfied, but all in all, it's not a bad sunless tanner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBV2YH0T6MWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOL1D66#wasThisHelpful","R2NBV2YH0T6MWY","A1E5WXNTI7EO2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E5WXNTI7EO2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice quality! I received this product at little or no cost in exchange for an honest review. I was surprised for the cost at how high quality this product was once I received it. It is very nice and very sturdy. I have an extra large dog (a mastiff) and I will say this collar BARELY fit his huge fat neck! I cannot make it any longer, but luckily it does fit him for now. He responded well to it, and I was a bit worried as I have never used something like this before. He does not even need it too much though because he is a good listener as is. I love having this when I take my morning jogs and hikes with him.

"Hugh Grant plays a screenwriter who won an Oscar fifteen years ago, but now is unemployed and broke. His agent arranges for him to take a job teaching screenwriting in a university in upstate New York. It's the last thing he wants to do, but he has no choice. There, he gets off to a bad start, sleeping with one of his students and insulting a tenured formidable member of his department, played by the amazing Allison Janney, by telling her he hates Jane Austen, her area of expertise (a fact made all the more funny due to Grant's prior role in the Austen classic ""Sense and Sensibility""). He then meets a single mom played by Marissa Tomei who both challenges him and brings out the best in him. While it definitely has some morally questionable moments, this is a laugh-out-loud funny movie, filled with great supporting characters, and is ultimately a story of redemption. Those who have ever dreamed of becoming a screenwriter will find it especially enjoyable.It is unrated, but would probably be PG-13 for one swear and sexual suggestions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZRBLTMMSG58V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDCKLHA#wasThisHelpful","RZRBLTMMSG58V","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lisa Duffy, an author and speaker for the CatholicMatch institute, overcame a painful divorce and annulment, remarried in the Church, and has spent the past twenty years ministering to those who have been wounded by divorce.In ""The Catholic Guide to Dating after Divorce,"" Duffy provides authentic Church teaching on divorce, annulment (including the benefits of going through the process), remarriage and receiving the Eucharist. Sharing her first-hand experience, she understands the pain of going through a divorce. ""Rebuilding after divorce is hard work and it requires patience and persistence . . . It is easy to lose sight of the fact that we are lovable, valuable, and God still has great plans for us.""Soon after her divorce, co-workers and other well-meaning individuals wanted to fix her up on dates, but Duffy cautions that one must ""take the time to properly heal from your own divorce before entering into a serious dating relationship.""How does one do that? Duffy offers five attraction factors that help an individual become a better version of themselves. These ""five factors will help you become the best, most attractive version of yourself, and pave the way for you to experience greater satisfaction in your relationship, and to improve your ability to give and receive love."" These five factors include being available, being affectionate, being a communicator, being faithful, and being magnanimous.Duffy has extremely high standards for individuals to meet before being ready to date after a divorce (or to date in the first place). If everyone met them, no doubt the world would have many more happy marriages. However, we live in a world of imperfection. Perhaps it would be more practical to aim for the high standard, but be willing to accept an 80% success rate in both oneself and potential partners.Duffy offers concrete advice and areas for individuals to work on to heal from divorce and prepare for dating. ""The Catholic Guide to Dating After Divorce"" is a book many divorced Catholics can benefit from. It also might make for good reading for parish priests and pastoral ministers to help in their role as counselors to the faithful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R6IJF1QC25B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594715971#wasThisHelpful","R1R6IJF1QC25B3","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Colette Lafia, spiritual director, writer, retreat facilitator and part-time school librarian, knows something about having dreams not come true. She and her husband are infertile and all their prayers and efforts to conceive a child came to naught. In addition, her sister died of breast cancer, her husband's business failed, and she suffered from chronic insomnia.Such was Lafia's life in October 2002 when she traveled to the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky searching for some peace. There she would meet Brother Rene, ""an elderly monk with a warm and down-to-earth disposition . . .[who] would become [her] spiritual companion, teacher, and a source of inspiration for seven years."" The two bonded quickly and begin an epistolary relationship in which Brother Rene would help Lafia to learn the value of surrender.""Surrender is the spiritual aspect of acceptance, inviting and allowing us to hold our experiences and lives with grace in every moment."" When we have embraced surrender, ""we stop wanting our lives to be something other than what they are and begin to recognize what is right in front of us, the life that is truly our own.""It was an important lesson that Lafia would need even more as she cared for her father who was dying of Parkinson's disease. He, too, had to accept the gift of surrender as he needed to release control and let others care for him.Lafia writes in beautiful and honest prose, sharing her weakness and struggle as she comes to terms with the life that she lives and the new opportunities that God provides. An attitude of surrender can be beneficial at any age, but is perhaps most suited to those who have experienced some great loss in life, be it of family members or a long hoped for dream.After life has dealt some fierce, painful blows, one must dig deep for the ability to go on. A spirit of surrender can only serve to help that process, and ""Seeking Surrender"" offers a gentle roadmap to letting go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2946LXYQVB3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193349588X#wasThisHelpful","R2946LXYQVB3Q","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is evident from the very first pages of ""Arriving at Amen"" that Leah Libresco is a highly intelligent woman. A former atheist, she came to believe in God through a logical process, a proof by contradiction.She describes seven types of prayer: petition, confession, the examen, the rosary, the divine office, lectio divina, and the Mass, and shares how she came to understand and utilize these forms of prayer in her own life.Unlike many of us who have embraced the Catholic faith since birth, Libresco has a constant spirit of questioning. She comes to these prayers from a radically different perspective. As an example, she attempts to explain transubstantiation via algebraic formulas. While such an explanation was beyond the intellectual capabilities of this reader, one has to give Libresco credit for originality and a fresh look at traditional prayers and rituals.Libresco holds St. Peter in high esteem, describing him as having ""a loud faith"" - always bold, always questioning, always trusting in God, and always moving forward. It is this faith that she wishes to emulate and she invites her readers to go along for the journey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI48F66WTMBM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594715874#wasThisHelpful","RI48F66WTMBM6","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Between Heaven and Texas"" is a prequel to the Cobbled Court Quilt Series. Fans of the books will recognize Mary Dell as a big-time quilt instructor from Texas who is friends with Evelyn, owner of Cobbled Court Quilts, but you don't need to know that or to have read any of those books to enjoy this one. It follows Mary Dell as she grows up in Texas on a huge ranch in a town called Too Much.  She faces her share of adversity, but she is a woman with pluck, personality and fashion sense as big as the state she calls home. You can't help but want her to succeed. This is a great book to read when you feel like life is giving you too much to handle. It's theme is making the best of what you got and the importance of sisterhood.

"This planner has an elegant, professional feel with the suede type cover. It's large - full notebook size - so it won't get lost.

"""Inside the O'Briens"" is not the type of book I usually review. Focusing on an Irish Catholic Boston family, there are passages in this book that are so anti-Catholic they made my blood boil. In addition, the f-word is used so often, it almost becomes part of the background of the novel. There is also lots of premarital sex going on (although only one semi-graphic depiction). So, why am I recommending it? Because at the end of the day, this is an incredibly powerful pro-life novel about the value of life at all its stages and in all its circumstances, even the ones that are most painful to imagine.Lisa Genova is a Harvard educated neuroscientist best known for her novel, Still Alice, about a woman suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. In ""Inside the O'Briens,"" she paints a portrait of a Boston cop suffering from another disease, this one much less well-known, but no less devastating. Huntington's Disease, which I admit I had never heard of before reading this book, is a way of life for 37,000 people in the United States. It is a genetic disease which means that children of someone who have it have a 50% chance of developing the disease.Inside the O'Briens focuses on the cop himself as he faces life with this disease, and on his youngest daughter who struggles with making the decision of whether to find out if she carries the gene. There are also three other children who play less of a role in the story, and the mother, a devout Catholic, who has her own struggles facing this new way of life.This is a well-woven story that educates and makes you think at the same time. It would be a great book club choice that would foster much discussion. Genova is hoping to raise awareness and money for Huntington's research through this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26UT49DYQBSFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147671777X#wasThisHelpful","R26UT49DYQBSFM","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a local history buff and so I was excited to see this new edition from Images of America focusing on Baystate Medical Center, the largest medical facility in the Springfield, MA area. The roots of the medical center go back to Springfield City Hospital which opened its doors in 1870 in a farmhouse. It is interesting to read the historical text and view the images of the various institutions, buildings, and charitable donations would ultimately lead to the medical center we know today, which is still always in a state of change, evolving to better care for patients. The number of transformations also explains the various wings and configurations of the hospital, a building I get lost in every time I visit!The medical center also has a storied history as a center for nursing and medical education. Images of the students and their dorms are also very interesting. One might be surprised to find that many of the doctors and nurses are photographed with a cigarette in hand - a sign of very different times!This book would be of value to anyone who enjoys learning about Massachusetts history as well as to those who are interested in the evolution of medical care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8VWSEKZF68S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146712253X#wasThisHelpful","R3H8VWSEKZF68S","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Debbie Macomber is known for her series of books, but in ""Last One Home"" she decided to write a stand-alone novel focusing on the relationship among three sisters. Karen, Cassie, and Nichole were very close as children, but then Cassie ran away from home at age 18 to marry a man their parents did not approve of. This broke their parents' hearts and destroyed the relationship the sisters once had. Fast-forward thirteen years and Cassie is now a single mother trying desperately to build a new life for herself and her daughter after leaving her abusive husband. Karen and Nichole, meanwhile, have married and have children of their own. Left alone to deal with their parents' deaths, they split the inheritance, keeping only a few pieces of old furniture for Cassie if she wants to come get them.""Last One Home"" is about the power of sisterhood and forgiveness as well as second chances. There is a romantic element to the story as Cassie develops a relationship with Steve, a widower who lost his wife to cancer. He's a good man, but Cassie isn't sure if she can trust her heart.""Last One Home"" is a great, relaxing read to indulge in.

"It isn't every day that you pick up a book intended for small children and find a foreword by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, but Counting on Faith by Maurice Prater is no ordinary children's book.  It is a counting book, focusing on the numbers one through ten, but each page also teaches a tenet of the Catholic faith.One is for God the Father is heaven. There were two of each animal on Noah's ark. Three is for the three members of the Holy Family. Four is for the four evangelists. Jesus had five wounds which he showed to St. Thomas after the Resurrection. God created the world in six days. Seven is for the gifts of the Holy Spirit. In the Our Father, we ask God to help us eight times. There are nine different types of angels. Ten is for the Ten Commandments.The illustrations by Jason Koltuniak are attractive and reverent and serve to enhance the text.

"This new edition is a rewrite of a book Dawn Eden originally penned in 2006. She was then in her mid-thirties, a Jewish convert to Protestant Christianity, taking RCIA classes to become Catholic. Today, she is Catholic, finishing up a pontifical doctorate in theology, and has made a personal consecration of celibacy to the Sacred Heart of Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary.Eden was sexually abused as a child. She was raised in a liberal household by divorced parents. She had no desire to wait until marriage for sex, but did want to wait to be “’in love’ – whatever that meant.” Yet, over time she learned to disassociate sex from love and bought into the casual sex mentality.Once she made the decision to convert to Christianity, she determined to start living a chaste life. It definitely wasn’t easy. She shares her struggles, and goes on to explain why the struggles are worth it. Once she became Catholic and experienced the sacrament of Reconciliation, she began to discover that lust wasn’t necessarily her root sin. “The real problem might not be lust so much as envy (‘the woman who has him doesn’t deserve him’), pride (‘I deserve him’), or resentment (‘how dare he not notice me’). It could even be a sin against the Love Commandment: failing to love God enough to trust that he has a plan for me.”Eden is a wise guide who can speak from experience on how the road of sin brings no fulfillment. She knows that most people who seek solace in sex are actually seeking love. She knows sex should not be separated from married love. “In a truly loving relationship, both the man and the woman love God, and so they become God’s love to each other.”  But even married love will never be perfect. “We are not meant to be fully satisfied on this earth.” She encourages readers to “make friends with that sense of longing.”“The Thrill of the Chaste” is ideal for those who are currently finding their sexual way of life unfulfilling, for those who want to be chaste, and for those who are chaste, but struggle with lust and temptation. Those who struggle with their self-worth and attempt to find love and a sense of value in sex may also find the road to healing in these pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJ6O8VC3EBH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594715580#wasThisHelpful","R1UJ6O8VC3EBH3","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chastity is for Lovers: Single, Happy, and (Still) a Virgin, by Arleen Spenceley, is by a twenty-nine year old woman who is still looking for Mr. Right. She has high standards, refuses to lower them, believes that God has a plan for her (which may or may not include marriage), understands that true love is hard and involves sacrifice, and says that she is not “saving herself for marriage,” because “only Christ can save us.” Rather, she believes that she is “saving sex” by “redeeming it. By God’s grace, I have chosen to resist the damaging cultural trends that trivialize the purpose of human sexuality. I refuse to use or regard the human body in any way that doesn’t revere its dignity or sanctity. In marriage, sex is a gift of the totality of oneself to another person.”Spenceley is an idealist. She has a healthy dose of self-confidence and is happy with her life, while acknowledging that it is sometimes difficult to still be single. She is not judgmental and is very clear that those who have had premarital sex should not be condemned or considered less worthy than those who have waited, instead encouraging the use of the sacraments to provide individuals with the opportunity to be forgiven and start over. She should be given a great deal of credit for being willing to go public with such a counter-cultural lifestyle. That in itself takes a great deal of courage.  Her book would be great for reading and discussing in a teen youth group. It is probably best for those who are still virgins to encourage them to continue on that route.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BPTP27G5GHJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PB8BE42#wasThisHelpful","R3BPTP27G5GHJZ","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Chasing Sunsets"" is the second book in the ""Angels Walking"" series by best-selling author Karen Kingsbury. The Angels Walking team is once again on the job, this time trying to protect baseball player Marcus Dillinger from being killed by a gang hit and working to help a young girl named Lexy escape from a life that leads to nowhere. Meanwhile, Mary Catherine is a young woman who knows her days are limited and is trying to squeeze all the life out of them that she can. She does not want to fall in love, knowing that she has no future, yet Marcus has a pull on her she can't understand. Tyler and Sami are back from the first book, this time in a supporting role.This is a sequel that is actually better than the original (which was pretty good in itself). If you are a fan of Kingsbury or Christian fiction, you will enjoy this book. It tackles some tough issues, offering a look inside gang life and the prison system, but Kingsbury handles them with great skill.

"As an educator, whether in a classroom or in your own home, it can be a challenge to understand children who learn differently from you. ""Talkers, Watchers, and Doers: Unlocking Your Child's Unique Learning Style"" by Cheri Fuller helps explain the different ways individuals learn and then how to help educate or advocate for these children.Most people have one main area of strength - either auditory (talkers), visual (watchers), or kinesthetic (doers), with another area being a secondary way of learning. Fuller offers ways of identifying how someone learns as well as concrete ways of helping that person learn.Fuller also discusses how to best develop your child's talents and gifts and how to handle weaknesses so that they don't block strengths. The last chapter on learning-different people who achieved great things is inspirational and worth having a child who is struggling read (or reading it to them).This is a slim volume packed with quality information.

"Forgiveness - both asking for it and giving it can be a hard concept for children, and even adults, to understand and follow through on. ""I Forgive You: Love We Can Hear, Ask For, and Give"" by Nicole Lataif is a children's story with an important message. She begins by telling children that they do a lot of things right, but when they make a mistake, God is always ready to forgive them. She also points out that forgiveness can still mean that there are consequences for our actions.Lataif encourages children to forgive their friends and to put their friends before things. She acknowledges that forgiveness can often take time, but that not forgiving is the scariest choice. We all need to ask God to help us forgive when we have been hurt or are angry. ""Not forgiving is like having an elephant in your heart. He grows and grows. He gets heavier and heavier until . . . CRACK! He breaks your heart.""The book ends with a children's prayer to both forgive and be forgiven. Both children and adults need to hear and be reminded of the message of this book.

"Since becoming Pope on March 13, 2013, Pope Francis has taken the world and the Church by storm. He took Francis as his name and ""his optimism, courage, and playful sense of humor are reminiscent of the beloved saint."" In ""The Spirit of St. Francis: Inspiring Words from Pope Francis,"" editor Alicia Von Stamwitz has collected a quotable collection of Pope Francis' teachings.Cognizant that the Pope's words have occasionally been taken out of context, Von Stamwitz emphasizes that these quotations ""have been selected and arranged with care. They are taken directly from the official Vatican texts of Pope Francis's homilies, speeches, tweets, audiences, prayers, daily meditations, and writings.""The quotations are organized into themes: the love of God, God's forgiveness, God's mercy, prayer, joy, humility, the poor, preaching the Gospel, promoting peace and pardon, and protecting creation. This book is not meant to be read cover to cover, but rather to be opened to a certain section to read a quote or two, and then to reflect upon that quote. It would be a perfect book to have on a nightstand to assist with morning or evening prayer.Like St. Francis, Pope Francis offers so much food for thought in both his words and his deeds.

"As one might expect, the first greatest story ever told is that of God creating the world and then sending His son to save us from our sins. Throughout human history, God has wanted His people to know Him, to love Him, and to Trust Him, but due to sin, this has not been an easy task. In ""The Second Greatest Story Ever Told,"" which is actually a continuation of the first greatest story, Fr. Michael Gaitley makes a compelling argument that the story of Marian Consecration, Divine Mercy, and the life and mission of St. Pope John Paul II are the second most important example of God at work in our world.Fr. Gaitley has written a page-turner, connecting St. Margaret Mary, St. Alphonsus, St. Therese, the Marian apparitions at Fatima, St. Faustina, St. Maximilian Kolbe, Polish history, and St. Pope John Paul II is what could be considered a Divine conspiracy. With God there are no coincidences, and through the lens of history we are now able to connect dots that may have previously seemed unrelated.  Even those with a working knowledge of the history of the Divine Mercy Devotion and the life of St. John Paul II will find new information in these pages. The threads working through history are truly amazing. In addition, the connection between Marian Consecration and Divine Mercy is explored in a new way, with St. Pope John Paul II held up as the high example of integrating the two in one’s life.Fr. Gaitley’s purpose in writing ""The Second Greatest Story Ever Told"" is not merely to recount history, but rather to encourage readers to become part of this great story. The mission of Divine Mercy did not end with the death of Pope John Paul II a decade ago. Rather, we are all called to take part. Pope Francis has said that “It is up to us, as ministers of the Church, to keep alive this message . . .  Now is the time of mercy.” Gaitley offers steps that one can take to be part of this story, including making the Marian Consecration and joining the newly formed Marian Missionaries of Divine Mercy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E4ULO3O113ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXWJU2K#wasThisHelpful","R2E4ULO3O113ZW","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now in her thirties and married to Joshua Glick, she is expecting again.

She has had six other children, one of which is out in the world, lost to the community. Her last pregnancy, several years earlier, died prematurely at birth. Meanwhile, their farm is in trouble due to a failed crop. Etta and Mose will be forced to trust in a God full of surprises.The story I wish to focus most on is the first, ""In His Father's Arms"" by Beth Wiseman. While all four of these novellas are very pro-life, this particular story is especially so. Ruth Anne and Levi are a very young married couple, only in their late teens. They are excited about the birth of their first son, Joshua, but the fact that he has Down Syndrome complicates things. Levi had a cousin with the same syndrome who died young and he is scared to bond with his son and then lose him. These leaves Ruth Anne feeling all alone to cope with the doctor's appointments and the usual stress of having a new newborn. In a world in which far too many babies are aborted because of Down Syndrome, these novella offers an honest and very positive story about a young family trying to cope.""An Amish Cradle"" is a delight. The stories are long enough to allow for full character development and enjoyable plot lines, while being short enough for busy readers to complete and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UY81JUPXPCOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052911867X#wasThisHelpful","R3UY81JUPXPCOT","A19Q59T3Y3WF1V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19Q59T3Y3WF1V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charles Davis’ Pilgrim of Love combines the mystery of the Da Vinci code with the ancient feel of Name of the Rose, adding plenty of verve and humor to create an enticing, authentic, and thoroughly enjoyable read. Zany foot-chases through hallowed halls and end-of-the-world predictions are interspersed between wild conversations and thought-provoking discussions. A wonderful cast of characters lie in wait for the unsuspecting protagonist, from a corpulent monk using alchemy to convert “faith... into a more tangible currency,” to the beautiful, enigmatic child who serves his broth. But this protagonist is a pilgrim of no currency, well-educated, fiercely determined, and surely most loyal to all his holy vows. He’s also a believer in order rather than magic, though the solving of mysteries does most surely entice him.Tempted by sigils and signs, drawn toward the alchemy of interpretation, and set on a quest, perhaps, to find the Holy Grail of Arthurian legend, this young monk’s thirst for knowledge lures him quickly into mystery and intrigue, drawing the reader happily behind him. Enjoyably complex language is used simply and clearly, conveying a convincing feel for time and place. Mysterious emblems, riddles, and interpretations abound, with alchemy born, perhaps, in the art of metaphor. But what happens when metaphors become real?The story is set on the island of Mont St Michel. With “no one way, no right path” through the quicksands surrounding it, or through the valleys of gods and life, the protagonist seeks a way through alchemical confusion and human emotion, until his deepest mystery might be “how very pagan is the nature of nature.”This is a place where “All stories are false.” Gnosticism meets science, and faith meets love. Meanwhile true alchemy is a magic born of fiction and words. Pilgrim of Love is a wonderful story, beautifully told, and a mystery that keeps the pages turning, with cleverly spaced hints and clues, fascinating symbols, genuine romance, and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EEBQ6MYKPOIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1507775008#wasThisHelpful","R1EEBQ6MYKPOIF","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever wondered how James Bond can walk away from so many disasters with hardly a scratch? It’s a talent shared by Casey Holden, the protagonist of Robert Downs’ Falling Immortality. But Holden’s not immortal, and the women won’t quite always fall for him. He’s a surfer – of internet and waves. He’s an ex-cop with money. And he’d really rather not tax himself with too much work. But he’s quickly drawn into the mystery of who killed his client’s husband. After all, she’s a beautiful client, and surely she won’t resist his charms.Convincing dialog fills the scenes where Holden and his cop friend tease each other while teasing the truth out of details. They’re long scenes, filled with plenty of good-humored male banter, their leisurely pace nicely balanced with fast-action car-chases and more.The first-person narration remains convincing throughout this novel – a little grating to female readers perhaps, as Holden repeats his attraction to women and his preference for ones who are willing to remove their clothes. Neither character nor plot are as classy or classic as James Bond. But the tongue-in-cheek survival of all dire straits echoes the title pleasingly. Long on dialog and digression, it’s a novel to pick up and put down as the day progresses, with plenty of easy recapping of forgotten detail and no need for long deep thoughts.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KD4SYU1PUKYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F5OZMO#wasThisHelpful","R1KD4SYU1PUKYP","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever wondered how Mary might have felt when she met the angel? Have you questioned if Mary and Joseph truly loved each other? Have you tried to imagine the world where they lived, with its customs and culture and mores? Author E. G. Lewis offers insight into all of these, through a beautifully crafted short novel of a world not so long ago, not so far away. The characters feel hauntingly real, from first meeting to last. Cousin Elizabeth has a delightfully honest amazement at late pregnancy. Zechariah the taciturn is a pleasing side character. Parents and friends weave in and out of the story with honest concern. And Mary the teenager has so much to learn.Details are beautifully researched, powerfully convincing, and never overwhelming in this tale. The author balances fact and fiction perfectly, building an authentic world, and revealing a story-behind-the-story that draws the reader in, no matter how well we think we know the tale.Life is a journey, and many journeys are taken along this road. But there’s one destination, one promise, and one nativity so well-imagined I’ll never be able to see it in another way. Thank you E. G.

"To wake each morning with no knowledge of what went before – this could be the premise for an endless tale of horror, but instead S. J. Watson’s Before I Go To Sleep is an intriguing, compelling story of a woman in search of herself. Perhaps half its power lies in the fact that we’re all, in one sense or another, searching for identity. With no knowledge of the woman’s condition, readers empathize quickly and enter her fears. Are we accepted or fooled? Are we loved or used? Are we rising toward hope or condemned to eternal nonentity?Christine’s journal shifts from love to hope to fear and back again, running the gamut of emotions day by day. The author weaves past and present together beautifully, giving both that ring of uncertain truth as lies intervene with malicious or honest intent. The stories balance perfectly, keeping the reader unsettled, never quite guessing, always hoping, and waiting for the end. By the end, the story feels right; feels done; and I’m delighted to have read it.Combining clever premise with believable characters and honest direction, Before I Go To Sleep is a book to finish before you go to sleep, just in case...Disclosure: We found it in a list of best books and I couldn’t resist it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MOLYMTNECRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GUSG4M#wasThisHelpful","R25MOLYMTNECRP","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Senegal's tightly closed world of embassy employees and Peace Corp volunteers, the wives (or occasional husbands) struggle for identity and strive to fill the endless days of being defined by ""other."" Emily is one such wife, a musician playing in a volunteer orchestra, a mother, and a woman with few friends in her foreign world. When one of those friends is murdered, Emily could quietly accept that the men will solve the crime, or she could follow her heart and look for answers.Emily makes a pleasantly smart, believable protagonist in this mystery, neither too clever nor too foolish, but certainly determined. In the late ‘90s, Senegal reveals itself as a place filled with real people, local and foreign, with real needs and real desires. Women suffer genital mutilation as a matter of course, as Emily learns. Terrorists are an ever-present fear. Cultural divisions create amusing moments. And wounded relationships thrive.Author Carole Howard weaves authentic details and invaluable lessons seamlessly and unobtrusively into this novel, making it a truly evocative read, well-grounded in culture, time and place. Nicely drawn images of life in a different world invite readers to see through other people's eyes. The agony of needed change is beautifully balanced against the pain of change enforced through death, and hidden secrets reveal the need for and meaning of true friendship.Meanwhile the deadly adagio plays – slow in the heat of a Senegal day, whispering the need for change, and well-composed with mystery in the beginning, middle and end.Disclosure: I bought a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17OSQI0MLED6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT6Z5V8#wasThisHelpful","R17OSQI0MLED6L","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In December ’97 big sister Kayla writes, “It’s... Christmas break in Bay Village and I can’t bear Renee the zombie or Daddy in his dead zone fog or Mommy pretending to be happy...”Kayla’s story and her mother’s come to life with convincing first person narration in this novel by Nicole Eva Fraser, while Renee is always a third person character, even when we see from her point of view. Fading into the background of her own life, never belonging, never quite moving forward from the mental illness that haunts almost invisibly, Renee changes from sweetly imaginative child into brooding adult and wrecker of social occasions. But she’s still loved, and this novel of awkward, genuine, confusing and wounded love, in all its many guises, is beautifully told.Real characters fill these pages with sibling rivalry, schoolgirl friendships, mourning for the lost, and an awkward need to believe in or deny self-worth. All these issues are tackled through convincing storylines, each different thread drawing the reader further in. Each character takes center stage as adult and child, making right decisions and wrong, and moving on. Meanwhile Renee, in her strange confusion, is just as real and deserving of sympathy as anyone else, her emotions and those of her family retold with evocative conviction.I could hardly put this novel down, and I truly loved the blend of convincingly flawed characters, of suspicion giving way to reality, and of faintly paranormal aspects converging on clinical distress. The book reads like a journey through real lives, and leaves the reader with much to ponder, and new friends to keep in the heart. It’s a well-balanced tale of unbalanced lives; and a novel of the waning century, filled with perfectly chosen detail and authentic descriptions.

"Author Paul Michael Peters introduces Mr. Memory in the first story of this well-crafted collection: An old man, filled with so many memories that he’s tired of the same old questions; a young man with three surprisingly connected gifts; and a storybook that ensues, filled with treasured moments for the reader.The tales are short and quickly read, perfect for coffee breaks – but beware; like chocolate, they lure the reader into just one more. Each story carries hints of mystery in connections waiting to be made. Each takes the reader on flights of well-drawn history and place, and powerful characterization. A sense of parable and myth builds one story into the next, even when the path is so different.

"Ursula Le Guin’s Steering the Craft is so much more than just another book on writing. This craft is a yacht steered on ocean waves, not a rubber toy bobbing in the tub. And this book is filled with wise advice, clear and well-described examples, and great exercises for people who don’t just want to write—they want to write well. It’s a book for people who love “the sound of language” and long to remove whatever is “ugly, unclear, unnecessary, preachy, careless... what doesn’t work” from their own pages to make them sound like music.With excerpts from authors as diverse as Rudyard Kipling and Patrick O’Neil, or Zora Neale Hurston and Jane Austen, with exercises that feed into and build on each other, and with a nicely nuanced approach to grammar and other tools of the trade, the author assists our writing, so our writing can assist other people’s reading, and so the whole will be something worth both reading and listening to.Memorable one-liners stay in the mind long after reading. Authors are reminded to take responsibility for what they write—nothing happens “somehow” without the author’s intervention. Memorable asides make lessons long-learned finally make sense—did you know grammar and punctuation exist to assist sound? And each reader will surely have their favorite lesson and favorite point. For me, the reminder that story comes first, not conflict, is a lesson that will ease my conflicted writing of tales.Highly recommended; enjoyably readable; and filled with the sort of exercises every writing group should take time to tackle; Steering the Craft is a must-add to any writer’s bookshelf.Disclosure: My thanks to the friend who loaned it to me from her shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVR3KQHH7NDV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2414SC#wasThisHelpful","RVR3KQHH7NDV9","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a dark future world, family size is limited, family planning is enforced, and a peaceful society takes whatever measures necessary to avoid the presence of the unwanted – or the useless. Of course it’s hard to determine the future use of a child, but the present is what matters. And little Robbie’s “present” is bleakly Orwellian.Zara Heritage peoples her novel with a large cast of eminently believable characters, from innocent children to adults, some of whom enjoy society’s benefits without question while others risk all to affect change. One is a modern day abortion survivor who lost her arm in her mother’s attempt to lose her. Another child loses his finger, and a grandmother other loses the child she has loved and cared for.Like the Schusterman’s Unwind , Cast  me not away builds on society’s neglect for the weak, and its willingness to devalue of human life, hiding atrocity behind nice words. The abortion debate plays its part in this imagined future history, as does faith, but neither are allowed to overwhelm the story. Drawing readers in with intriguing quotes from many sources and a plot that blends excitement, action and suspense with thought provoking situations, the author has created a scary fast-moving story that’s well worth the read. Don’t miss the quotations at the end of the novel – the world’s wide history and faiths have much to teach, and we all have much to learn.If you’re radically pro-abortion, this won’t be the book for you. But if you’re even vaguely near the fence, if you’re opposed to the devaluing of human life through death penalties, unwarranted war, or any other cause, then read, enjoy, and ponder.

"Author Ernest Cline creates a scarily believable near-future world in Ready Player One. Hints of The Matrix and 1984 build into a crowded, ill-fed place where corporations lie, corruption rules, and money is the root of everything. Ironically, the character who creates a Willy Wonka-like contest at the story’s beginning is himself a product of the ‘80s, so readers might not only think of 1984, they’ll swim in a sea of movie, music and entertainment references from that famous year as well.Dystopian teen fiction is frequently filled with romance and hints of magic. Ready Player One takes a different tack and keeps readers of all ages engaged. This teen protagonist’s end-of-school includes trying to stay alive and hoping to beat the competition. There’s no time for love. Relationships are built on e-connections founded in e-worlds, all bound together, all too believably, in an all-pervasive internet.The author balances real world and e-worlds perfectly in this novel, drawing readers in, just as a computer game might, then releasing us into worlds within worlds, connections within connections, and a pleasing mystery to be solved with ‘80s lore. As the real world catches up with the imaginary, e-lives becomes all too personal, e-dangers are real, and human connection might, after all, be the truth that sets us free.

"Dystopian, relevant, scary, balancing believability with cool imagination and haunting characterization, Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake invites readers into a perfect, perfectly ruined world, revealing a hauntingly possible path that leads to ruination. It’s a truly scary story, very peacefully and calmly told. It’s a truly dismaying interpretation of where our genetically engineered, profit-driven, powered-by-advertising world could eventually lead us. And it’s funny, touching and sad, just like real life.Snowman is the protagonist, living a fragile life among strangely unfamiliar people, and remembering the way things used to be. His friend Crake grows from child to man in that remembered world, sympathetic perhaps, but lacking empathy, brilliant and driven, filled with all the skills to succeed and hiding secrets underneath. Meanwhile Jimmy follows behind, clever in his own way but always on the outside looking in, sad and disappointed with a life that’s let him down. Meanwhile big business needs both of them, one to create and one to advertise. And the woman loved by both perhaps needs neither.Can we build a world on lies? Can we build relationships without truth? Can we build a new vision for the future without destroying the past? And can we continue along this gene-splicing, instant-gratifying, well-advertised, and well-trodden path without our world falling apart?Oryx and Crake asks deep questions in the guise of a novel filled with emotional and physical threat and ease, despair, and eventual hope. It’s a cool, deeply involving read, one that leaves the reader hauntingly wanting more, and yet feels powerfully complete – the outsider still outside, still looking in, still seeing more than his heart is willing to admit.Disclosure: A friend told me I’d love it and she was right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHM6R2A4OBM85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385721676#wasThisHelpful","RHM6R2A4OBM85","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Once upon a time” begins this pleasantly new fairytale, colorfully illustrated with the muted tones and intricate detail of books from a time before computers, filled with almost-glowing renditions of rainbows in every shape and kind, and written with that smoothly absorbing language of true fairytale.

And there’s a wealth of cool characters, interesting rainbow images, and fascinating ideas to intrigue parent and child. A pleasingly simple science experiment weaves its way into the tale, and a wise lesson is taught at the end, revealing true happiness comes, not from possessions, but from the heart.Parents and children will enjoy the old-fashioned, comfortable feel of the text and illustrations. There’s much to talk about in every scene—much to find and much to imagine. And there’s sure to be a person somewhere in the tale who looks like the reader or the reader’s best friend.

"Whispers of the Wolf is a deceptively simple story with surprising depth. A small lonely boy doesn’t like to run with his tribe because he’s always last. A small lonely wolf will surely die if nobody saves it. And a boy with a wolf learns to see through different eyes (and ears and paws), to tell stories, to make friends, and finally to run.But Whispers of the Wolf isn’t just about friendship. It’s about finding yourself, learning to trust, and even letting go. Two Birds lets go of his isolation, lets go of his fears, and finally even lets go of his beloved wolf.Whispers tells of an unchanging world, for all that it's set in a well-researched and convincing Pueblo village of the 1500s. Paws still pad today on the same ground. Winds still blow from distant lands. And if we stop talking long enough, we might still hear and see.Add wonderful illustrations, beautifully described in fact-filled notes at the back of the book, and this becomes a volume to treasure, for parents and children, for growing and learning together.

"Johnny Nothing is probably the perfect book for singularly imperfect boys. But it’s not all boogers and bodily fluids—there’s some wonderful language lurking behind the irreverence, such as when Johnny is compared to a “colour.” The humor is very English, convincingly teen and male, and somewhat smelly. Some readers might find it wearing after a while, like the worst of British TV imported to the States. But others, many of them unwilling readers aged from 10 to 18, will assuredly love it. There’s a boyish exuberance combined with a fascination for bodily functions; there are wonderful lists of puns from a round-the-world trip; and there’s the usual attraction of poor hopeless boy, powerful hopeless guardians, and unexpected opportunity. Of course, the powerful guardians—large obnoxious mother in particular—are amply skilled at the thwarting young Johnny’s plans, but a surprisingly wise lesson in failure might change things around.No thing is spared the sharp knife of humor and scorn in this tale. Politics and religion aren’t forbidden, and neither is BO. Names like Ebenezer Dark and Johnny Nothing offer a pleasing sense of fantasy. But, on the whole, this probably isn’t a book for reading moms.

"If you choose to read these devotions one a day, you’ll have enough material for more than a month. Alternatively, a busy mom might pick an appropriate topic from a nicely arranged chapter list and jump straight to the devotion most appropriate (jumping back for more, since each devotion ends with a link to the contents again). Titles cover deep issues of healing and brokenness, and everyday problems like baskets of dirty clothes. Feel burned out? There’s a devotion for that, and for when your work feels fruitless or fears overwhelm you.Each devotion begins with a Biblical quote (maybe several quotes) and ends in prayer. In between the reader is asked or guided through thought-provoking questions to see God’s truth behind life’s distractions. Who or what do you fear? Asks the author in one place. And Why should we have confidence in God?These devotions are all sufficiently long to draw the reader in, while still being short enough for a quick lunch break before school’s out again. Both authors are open and honest, reminding busy moms we’re all in this together—and God is with us. And both offer wise and practical advice, as well as prayer.For me, these devotions read like phone calls, with much left unsaid and much to ponder alone. The authors teach what they’ve learned rather than sharing complex details. And the lessons are good, well-written and well-planned for “the craziness of our lives.”For readers needing more, there are links to more books embedded in the text—a neat idea.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AANDLR6J71G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENNUULO#wasThisHelpful","R1AANDLR6J71G9","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautifully presented and nicely based in the Bible, Doeanna Nowadnick’s Signs in Life invites readers into her life story, shows how traffic signs relate to everyday living, and offers a wonderful guide to hearing and heeding God’s guidance. Well-chosen Bible passages (from Exodus) introduce each section. Very human photographs invite the reader to make friends with the author’s voice. And the signs...Stop signs are important—they save lives—but we’re all careless drivers sometimes, mouthing “Oops, sorry!” and glad to have been kept safe. Life signs matter too, when friends see we’re falling apart and show us the way. And Bible signs help—not just the Ten Commandments, but the history of obedience and disobedience, of danger and consequence, and of freedom and hope. It’s a history well-told in Exodus.“Facing the Red Sea, Moses had stopped and trusted in God for direction. Facing my own Red Sea of career choices, I plunged in,” says the author, each story segueing from driving, to personal life, to faith, to a rest area’s questions. “God’s able to work with our imperfections,” and the author’s life offers signs to readers, where we can see His work on our own path.I love the author’s natural, never-preachy voice, her gentle (sometimes even laugh-out-loud) humor, and the way these stories flow, as if I’m sitting at table with a friend. Did that really happen? And did you...? There are surprises, and deep revelations. There’s advice quoted from many sources. And then there are the questions, which make it all personal. Of course, I also love the book of Exodus. And...Deanna, I will cling to the picture of you at the bookstore, and I too will pray, “Please help me to get out of the way and let You lead.” Perhaps that’s the sign of a really good inspirational book—it’s sunk into my heart.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZFHE1HZLSMQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N066SU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZFHE1HZLSMQI","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With chapters that separately cover their own pieces of the “complex puzzle” which is happiness, Paul Van Der Merwe offers a story-book on happiness that might equally be read by random dipping as by sequential reading—rather like happiness itself. Parable or fable, these tales read smoothly and “happily” while teaching wise lessons through humor and animal interest. I read them sequentially, laughed out loud on occasion, and thoroughly enjoyed those stings in rat-like tails—Lucky being a rat (and a math teacher, no less!) in a Bushveld world of lions, elephants and more.Based on a theory that all our actions are aimed at increasing happiness, Lucky is sent to investigate the stories of other animals. Pleasing humor invites the reader into each tale, and intriguing situations transport modern life into the world of animals, as creatures tell what they’ve learned of happiness. The stories are offered with an unforced sense of fable, making this a really enjoyable read.My favorite story just might be the marketing executive hyena, creating “unhappiness while also supplying the fix.” “Be happy with the fur you live in” might be the wisest advice to un-furred humans as well as to Lucky the rat. And my favorite lesson? Well, I’m just going to check this review off my to-do list, plan next year’s vacation, and take life a little slower. I’m not sure happiness really is the only destination, but I do know I enjoyed this book. It’s even got (simple) graphs to appeal to the mathematician in me—after all, Lucky is a math teacher!Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYF4VBK6RV4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVQ9KO6#wasThisHelpful","R1XYF4VBK6RV4F","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author of Maximum Mental Health is an Australian life coach, hypnotherapist, and clinical psychologist. In Maximum Mental Health, he offers a collection of principals aimed at helping readers improve their motivation, mood, meaning and mastery, in the search to cure or counter anxiety and depression. “For someone who is in the ‘normal’ range and more self-improvement focused; or who is suffering from only mild to moderate range issues, the application of these principles alone” might be enough to satisfy. For others, the book might provide some sense of direction in which to progress.Hypnosis is nicely explained in this volume, though the book is not about hypnosis. Mental skills are convincingly described. The difference between thought, feeling and action is wisely presented. The way online life and advertising feed into feelings of depression is disturbingly persuasive. And there’s plenty of nicely practical advice. The author offers intriguing downloadable content (which I did not avail myself of) to help readers progress further, including “mindfulness recordings to listen to.”From optimism, to pessimism, to following the latest diet plan, with or without spirituality, with or without hypnosis, Maximum Mental Health is user-friendly, reader-friendly, and an interesting read.

"“From the time he began teaching the 1930s, and until his death 1972, Neville [Goddard] beautifully expounded upon the main concepts of this guide.” So says co-author Tim Grimes as he introduces readers to his predecessor’s wise suggestions. The central theme, that learning to relax will paradoxically help us achieve more in the modern high-speed world, is well-taught (though not necessarily as “logical” as the author would suggest).“By allowing ourselves to relax, we begin to naturally fall into a state of subtle gratitude and humility,” says Grimes. It’s not our thoughts that drag us down, but rather our “dysfunctional relationship with them.” And failure is all too often a failure of the imagination. Injunctions to imagine what we want rather than dwelling on what we lack echo religion’s “Just have faith” mentality, but Grimes keeps his writing both secular and simple, offering exercises and wise advice that anyone can apply.Goddard phrases it all more spiritually, viewing Biblical texts as metaphor rather than history, and offering quotes like, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” A strong emphasis on feeling might suggest we just need to do what feels right, but Grimes does a nice job of promising nothing, offering much, and letting readers interpret the meaning as they choose.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R186VGR0PGCX74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010965P4U#wasThisHelpful","R186VGR0PGCX74","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gary Gibson’s the Extinction Game starts with a wonderfully imagined frozen world where one man fights for survival. Dogs have become feral. Ice has covered the land. And it’s the winter of mankind’s existence. Then everything, including the story, changes.Extinction, it seems, could come from multiple directions, perhaps even simultaneously, and the brave lone survivor becomes one of many in a team of extinction explorers. Characters, mystery and plot take on a computer game-like feel, as the team is compelled to collect ancient artifacts without ever knowing quite way. Politics lurks behind the scenes with hints of terror and questions that shouldn’t be asked. And then the story begins to take shape again as threats become real.Questions of identity, selfhood and self-determination; issues of terrorism and plot; the value or negation of freedom or free will -- there are serious undercurrents in this tale, bound together with nicely different survivalists, complex situations, well-drawn worlds, and a pleasing sense of personal solutions mattering more than the global. It’s an intriguing, thought-provoking tale that would convert beautifully into a computer game.Disclosure: I read the first few pages in the store and I was hooked.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX0M1FKOJW52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M43ZZZG#wasThisHelpful","R1BX0M1FKOJW52","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some novels paint a dystopian future after the end of the world. Others portray the world ending and the hero marching to survival. But Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven does neither of these. Instead she interweaves stories of before and after, of a time when so many details were important and a place where survival alone takes priority. She adds music and Shakespeare, to help survival make sense. And then she makes her own sense of it all through wonderful, slowly-grown interconnections, building a future on the ruins of our mistakes.The world most surely ends with a whimper in this novel. Survivors are real people rather than heroes, and heroes might die or go mad. But the future grows, like seeds in a scarred land. And the author distills it all into smooth reading. A wide-ranging novel of only 300 pages—no marathon slog—this is a beautifully constructed tale, a story that switches between locations and seasons with perfect timing, that builds its characters with convincing dialog and gorgeously imagined scenes, and that slides its mysteries and connections under the radar until they shine, like a glow on the horizon, like hope for the future of mankind.Love, romance, the search for meaning in life or death, the search for identity, and the responsibilities of relationship, all are here in a literary novel of the present time crossed with convincing science fiction.

"In Washington Heights, Manhattan, Detectives Pete Gonzalvez and Tolya Kurchenko find an apparent suicide and become convinced the woman is a victim of a multiple murderer. The trail crosses continents and years, with times, locations and characters vividly recreated and wonderfully relevant to the present day.While readers of the author’s earlier novel, Forgiving Maximo Rothmann, will be familiar with some of the people in this tale, new readers will find background information quickly and neatly threaded  exactly where needed. The novel stands alone perfectly.Author A. J. Sidransky portrays the cultural mix of Washington Heights through convincing dialog, haunting histories, and a powerful sense of that much larger world which shadows our everyday lives. The immigrant experience of never quite belonging feeds into a universal search for self, where spirituality, family commitments, the loyalties of friends, and even the cruelties of evil play their part.My favorite character must surely be Rabbi Rothmann, a wonderfully nuanced soul with genuine love for the people around him. My favorite scenes, because they feel so true, are those between a husband and wife as they fail to communicate vital information. (The dialog, here and everywhere, is surely spot on.) My favorite sub-plot follows Pete coming to terms with his family and his past. My favorite stranger is a Vietnamese seller of sandwiches. My favorite advice (from the rabbi of course)—“marriage is really about forgiveness—forgiving your spouse their shortcomings and forgiving yourself yours.” And my favorite theme must be the forgiveness he portrays.The author threads tales from past and present, from Manhattan, Europe, the Dominican Republic and more, and from hardscrabble failure to hard-won success, making a tapestry of real lives, woven, interwoven, interlinking in coincidence that somehow feels totally convincing, and bound into wondrous threads of relationship. The novel is a mystery, tinged with terror and suspense. But it’s also a tale of cultures combining and colliding, people learning, growing, and forgiving, and the ubiquitous nature of love conquering evil after all.If you’ve not already read Forgiving Maximo Rothmann, you’ll be eager to read it next after reading this—small lives writ large in bright colors, and the whole world’s the stage.Disclosure: I was given a free proof copy and I offer my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KP3Q9GXKB8FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990951561#wasThisHelpful","R1KP3Q9GXKB8FB","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Well, this just happens to be the one the sister goes back to...just happens to be the one where she meets... just happens to be the one. And something is going to happen, but the psychic younger sister can’t see through walls erected by those she loves.The story’s told in first person through different eyes, each section flowing beautifully from the last, and each view-point perfectly chosen.

"Author Sean Gorman was introduced to wrestling on TV at age 7, but understood straightaway that it’s not real—a fairytale for growing boys perhaps (though as time goes on, it becomes as much a fairytale world for girls). Blurring the line between fantasy and reality, the author/journalist embarks on an extra pseudo-career of contradictions. Pain for entertainment value or social advancement contrasts with and provides a retreat from the pains of real life. Fractured interests, broken relationships... where do they stand against the siren call of performance art?Until We’re Strangers Again brings to life the backstage of a world that never quite existed, where matches were choreographed and the audience pretended not to know; where watchers wept for their favorite character’s pain, just as they might in a movie theater; and where the psychology of insult reigned supreme. Gorman plays his audience well, then and now, and the writing has an immediacy and level of detail that draws readers in, even while holding them safely at arm’s length.Drink, sex and drugs; plenty of emotion both real and artificial; plus those curious dichotomies of a man who looking at wrestling chat boards and remembers Ernest Hemmingway quotes. It makes for a heady (and lengthy - 400+ pages) mix of real life, myth and magic where “Our narratives were a script.

"Told mostly in first-person, Dobyn’s Chronicles recreates the America of the 1800s and 1900s very convincingly, peopling it with characters from the author’s family history. There’s a wealth of fascinating detail woven into the story, and a great sense of place and space. Characters and the hardships they endure all seem real, from children orphaned by Yellow Fever, to threats of the evil tax-man and financial ruin. Train travel is new. Medicine is growing by leaps and bounds. Banks may or may not be trusted. And indoor plumbing in an hotel room is an amazing luxury. The protagonist goes through life with genuine good-hearted faith, accepting trials and joys and always willing to move on. He has a nice steady voice in the narration, obscured sometimes by long-winded dialog, but a delight in its honest and pleasant musings. The reader quickly believes a real person is telling this tale.I loved the sense of change in this novel, where characters don’t stay in one place, where homes are left or lost, where the past doesn’t have to define the present, and where risk and reward both engender hard work. I enjoyed the reminder that in simpler times, young people grew up faster and absorbed the family responsibilities at an early age. And I liked the gentle insights into modernity’s invasion as the lives of cowboys changed.It’s not a perfect novel, and it’s not a quick read, but Dobyn's Chronicles is an enjoyable tale, the characters are pleasingly memorable, and the story leaves reader with a gentle realization that, however much control we think we exert, lives can be changed completely in the short time lightning takes to strike.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJ2JEE6NMG5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNMM46S#wasThisHelpful","R3RJ2JEE6NMG5S","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barbara Venkataraman’s writing is as natural in describing the emotions of divorce, the psychology of crying, and the life of a small town lawyer, as it is in the details of mystery. Her characters and her narrator’s first-person voice have a pleasing sense of humor, built on natural narration and great dialog.

"Barbara Venkataraman’s second Jamie Quinn mystery begins with family lawyer Jamie back at work, enjoying a full calendar instead of the emptiness of grief. She still spends too long solving other people’s problems and not enough on her own, of course. And, having lost her mother, she’d love to find the father who’s been absent all her life.That’s the backstory. Meanwhile Jamie’s attempts to resolve a messy divorce are filled with amusing and intriguing details, and a very natural feel for human emotion and psychology. Family custody battles, mud-slinging, mis-communications and, perhaps, deliberate deceits abound—no wonder Jamie finds adoptions more satisfying! But one divorce takes a fatal turn when a murder case begins, and family law takes second place to some serious investigation of the suspects.All the familiar characters are here, making this another great, short, fun read, satisfying in its mystery and its relationships, and perfect for readers without too much time to spare.

"Everyone gets angry sometimes, child or adult. But understanding anger—how it feels, why we feel it, and what to do about it—is a concept we all too frequently fail to grasp. Corine Hyman’s nicely illustrated picture book makes this scary feeling honestly important and controllable—a valuable lesson for many adults as well as children. The text offers a pleasingly simple assessment of why God gives us the feeling of anger and what we should do with it. Simple examples, that children will quickly relate to, offer sensible advice. And bright-colored images will keep any child’s attention.The author chooses a nice selection of Bible verses to strengthen her case, sprinkling them naturally throughout the text, highlighting them pleasingly in text boxes, and listing them conveniently at the end. Readers don’t need to be Bible readers though. The advice is eminently practical rather than spiritual. And the lessons are nicely taught.My only complaint is that (in the version I read) the pictures, which I really like, are occasionally stretched or shrunk on the page. The characters are surprisingly recognizable though, in every image and every emotion, giving the book a very lively convincing feel.

"Aloes are not as prickly as they seem. They bear beautiful flowers, and endure under cruel conditions, just like the characters who people the pages of G. Davies Jandrey’s novel, A Garden of Aloes. Their leaves forming a spiral leading to a hidden core, just like the scenes in this well-crafted tale.The novel is narrated in the voices of six different female characters, each unique, each wounded, and each powerfully vivid and real. Most amazing to me is Dee, whose complexly royal “we” becomes a metaphor for all our broken selves. Meanwhile Sam sees her better half making wise choices while her darker self stumbles. And the words from her mother’s mouth are rarely the ones she most longs to say.When past hurts define present circumstances, it really doesn’t matter how far in the past they are. And sometimes believing in the future is the wisest course. But a pre-teen girl has her own ideas of the future, fueled by an older sister’s girl-talk, the television, and a longing for affection. Hilariously honest scenes depict Sam pondering how a guy’s limp thing ever gets into a girl’s little hole, while deep sorrows, past and future, lurk, and Dee struggles against a host of allies and friends.Abuses, sexual, physical, emotional, accidental, deliberate and cruel color these lives, and the slow drawing back of curtains is like stroking those aloe leaves—not as sharp as you might expect, allowing more beauty than you might imagine, and bound to endure in the mind long after the story’s done.

The background of characters from both sides of the physical border, and from both sides of its legal restraints, are convincingly woven into stories of real people—a Mexican woman who longs to be with her husband; an American man who longs to be with his wife; those who own property, and those who don’t; those whose lives follow the rules of society, and those on different paths. As the journey progresses, there are lands of the heart just as arid as Arizona's desert.Four women take center place in this tale, for all that it’s a murder mystery where detective and suspects are men, and a social mystery where the victims are children too young to understand. Wiona is bound to the present. Emma speaks the past, but just might turn to see the future. Belen lives in limbo and fear. And Lucy opens her heart to reveal both hurt and hope.Stokey, meanwhile, patrols the border, obeys the rules, and maintains a human decency and concern. The past has hurt him too, and the future seems betrayed, offering another arid land from the title—another place between hurt and hope.The truth is, we all make our journeys when life’s promise fails. This novel reveals the common bonds between us, and the present flowers of the desert which might be seen if we open our eyes. It also reveals the darkness of human cruelty and greed, the desert’s danger that cannot be denied, whatever political views are espoused.Disclosure: I was given a free copy, and I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4VQ37TND0TMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZH3PGLS#wasThisHelpful","R4VQ37TND0TMD","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love coffee, I love books, and I love cats, so Death by Coffee, Bookstore Café Mysteries, with a cat on the cover, was bound to appeal to me. The story starts with new-in-town Krissy serving coffee at her newly-opened bookstore. Of course, there’s another café in this small town, so why would people come here? And there’s no promise that anyone will read or buy her books, even the ones written by her father. But Krissy and her friend are determined to make a go of this. Then one of their first customers is apparently poisoned while drinking from one of their cups.There’s something sadly convincing about the customer who says, “I’ve always wondered why we never had a bookstore in Pine Hills,” then doesn’t buy a book. But things might look up, and Krissy is ever hopeful. Her father was a writer, so she brings a tinge of fame. And if she hasn’t learned much about solving mysteries from him, she’ll just learn on the job.Told in first person, Death by Coffee creates a convincing picture of a somewhat disorganized, resolute sleuth, wounded by love but not too determined to avoid it in the future, hurt by the world but still eager to find good in it, and well-trained in the arts of asking awkward questions and trawling the internet. It’s a sweet cozy mystery, not too complex, nicely plotted, with a fine collection of side-characters adding color and promise for a series.Disclosure: I needed a book for a trip and this fit the bill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9G6D40MKLN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTS5RY#wasThisHelpful","R1R9G6D40MKLN2","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve never been to Chicago, but I love Jim Butcher’s Harry Dresden novels, so my husband suggested I try something a little more “normal.” Sara Paretsky’s city is just as convincing and intriguing, without the myth and magic. Her first person narrator has the same toughness as Dresden, the same folly in love, and the same downbeat sense of failure. But she's also strong, vibrant and determined, so I enjoyed following her. In this novel, violence causes real injury, crime bosses are a good blend of evil and humanity, and the central mystery grows through time, until good timing reveals it.Strong narration, a determined female protagonist, good friendships and a clever mystery make this a fun first book in the series. Fascinating details add depth and conviction, and I will certainly read more. Indemnity Only is a smooth fast read, balancing feminine interests with tough determination and risk, well-timed asides, an omnipresent fascination with the Cubs, and a clever crime to be solved.Disclosure: My husband buys good books for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22TRJ5ITKAE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EJDGRS#wasThisHelpful","R22TRJ5ITKAE3","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Transplant the Famous Five or Secret Seven to New Mexico, and you just might find yourself in Petroglyph Canyon. Christopher Cloud’s middle-grade novel is filled with great characters, enterprising children, overwhelmed adults, serious bad guys, and just the right level of mystery and real-world concerns.A drought is threatening Uncle Antonio’s ranch. In the present day climate, readers will certainly be interested to learn of its effects. Meanwhile precious artifacts are being stolen. The uncle has no time to intervene, and the kids, Pedro, Pia and Kiki, take it on themselves to solve the mystery and stop the loss.The author’s writing blends fact and fiction to create a real sense of time and place, from desert canyon to small-town gift-shop and more. Do you know the difference between a gathering and a roundup? Do you know what was happening in world history when the first petroglyphs were made? Do calves feel pain when they’re branded? And what is ESP?Young readers will find natural questions answered through very natural conversation. Meanwhile they’ll follow the three protagonists into a world that’s as full of convincing detail as it is of mystery. A wise Indian might help. A dangerous rich man might hinder. And bumbling crooks offer the perfect blend of scary danger and classic mis-steps. The Ghosts of Petroglyph Canyon is a fun fast read, perfectly tuned and timed for its middle-grade readers, and my only complaint is I wish the kids on the cover looked more like the kids inside.Disclosure: I was given a free copy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMTCAPIO6M27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6AX13Y#wasThisHelpful","R1GMTCAPIO6M27","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Burnham, Lorelei and Finch make a great trio at the center of this off-beat zombie novel. Dialog is cool and convincing, with a nice rendition of Finch’s English accent. The plotline is intriguing, from a “vice cop ingesting illegal pills” to a reanimated corpse endeavoring to remain sane. Plus there are some pleasingly thought-provoking twists – who is to blame for addiction; is reanimation is a betrayal of faith; or even what defines the better man?There’s plenty of internal dialog in this tale, slowing the pace perhaps, but adding convincing depth to both good guys and bad. Meanwhile the mad scientist, who’d be equally at home in a James Bond movie, is surpassed only by the evils of corporate greed. Best of all are the mysteries, for evil or for good, or for compulsion – to consume, to experience, to help... And there are cats.Dead Market starts with a cool premise and works its way to a pitch-perfect conclusion. A few less-than-convincing steps are easily outweighed by surprises and hidden depths.

"There’s a smoothly authentic Victorian feel to the beginning of this tale, but the modern-day writing is equally enthralling and convincing, pulling the reader in to mystery that grows deeper, wider and scarier as the story progresses. Start with one old-fashioned psychic. Let him imbue a portrait with his presence. Then see what happens a hundred years after his death.In the present day, a painting that has haunted a young woman’s childhood is sold to haunt a con-man’s future instead. But there’s so much more to this story, as psychic powers intersect with human greed, old-fashioned ways give space to the new, devotees are pulled into mystery while true psychics ponder the myth, and very human danger looms.The story ebbs and flows like the tide, while one strong woman seeks a safe solution to what’s fast becoming dangerously strange. It’s beautifully crafted, with subtle hints and slowly believable change. And it works to a pleasingly honest conclusion, satisfying and just. I really enjoyed this book.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ38083EHDRUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OX2BF28#wasThisHelpful","RZ38083EHDRUP","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while a book brings an era to life. Peter Joseph Swanson’s Space Monsters is one such book, combining well-chosen natural details of the early ‘80s with small-town university life and the obsessions of not-yet-adults. The result is something absorbingly trippy and determined. Dialog has the perfect cadence of teens, parents and teachers, combining questions of reliable Bible translation with exploration of the phrase “acid test,” cool history and more, all told with equal aplomb and well-researched conviction. Parents worry about teens, who try not to worry about anything, and end up totally worried about it all. Meanwhile something strange just might be happening down by the river, and small-town memories, or else a few scientific tests of the water, could hold the clue.“Being weird is just you being you,” says a mother to her child, who’s just learning to explore her unexpected roots. But are UFOs weird? Are disappearing books, and messages in dreams? And where do psychology and parapsychology meet?Galileo did “not feel obliged to believer\ that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use,” as is quoted in the book. Space Monsters is novel for those who aspire to use all these and imagination too. A wild, zany, scary, thought-provoking romp through rumors of the end-times and more, where space may be inner, outer, dimensional, or simply “spaced”—enjoy!Disclosure: I bought it because I really enjoy the author’s writing.

"Adam’s Tiger is the third of author Lawrence Lapin’s Adam chronicles. I’ve not read the earlier two, but there’s plenty of background information provided as Adam explains his past, so readers and new characters can catch up. This is a future world, where a meteor has destroyed life on earth. After five-hundred years, the human race repopulates the planet, while frozen embryos, skewed by the deliberate application of radiation, then mixed and matched by clever genetic engineering, are being used to balance nature’s tooth and claw.For complex reasons, complexly explained, Adam wants to bring back the creatures of the past. He is a singularly long-lived survivor of the original disaster, but he doesn’t pass on his strange genes too readily, since mankind is clearly not ready for immortality. Still, Adam himself is well-armed with skills and knowledge to play god. All he needs is the right measure of influence, and after five-hundred years, he knows well how to win friends and change people’s minds.Science, nature, society and more prove surprisingly malleable in this tale. The writing combines passages of exciting story-telling with lengthy exposition. Lessons in science and sociology abound. Romance is fast and happy. And religion is relegated to unimportance since it’s so hard to “imagine how any single being could have created the world by intelligent design.” Meanwhile Adam designs and plans, in a weighty mix of Noah’s ark and Creation, while language evolves so far and so fast that no one can “read the original Shakespeare” anymore.There are occasional typos, and the dialog’s occasionally stilted as it tries to pack so much in. But the concept is certainly intriguing and I do like the hairy people.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKK8541Z7J1BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDD8UEQ#wasThisHelpful","RKK8541Z7J1BR","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ernie the Elephant has one friend smaller than himself, Martin Mouse. He shares his toys with Martin, but “while Martin took a lot, he never seemed to share back. Ernie gave but never got.”This very short picture book uses short lines of text and some simple rhymes to tell how Ernie is hurt by Martin, and how Martin learns that “sharing tells friends you care.”The pictures are bright and fun. The lesson is wise. And if the rhymes don’t quite fit the rhythm, that’s not what it’s all about. The book is perhaps surprisingly short, but in an e-reading world old rules about pages no longer apply. It would make a quick pleasing bedtime story.Disclosure: I found it was free so I bought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVEYXHTGAPWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7GWC82#wasThisHelpful","RUVEYXHTGAPWU","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People don’t change just because they cross an ocean, and the people of Rebecca Burns’ The Settling Earth are as recognizable as any citizens of a busy town today. There are women of ill repute, struggling to get by. There are men who prey on them. There are people with hopes and plans, and people in despair. And there are children, lost to their parents, passed into a world of darkness. This is Christchurch, New Zealand, as seen through the eyes of its 18th century inhabitants, and the author recreates it beautifully in a gorgeous collection of interlinking short stories. Like Christophe McFarland’s The Chester Chronicles, Elizabeth’s Strout’s Olive Kitteridge, or D. A. MacQuin’s Polite Conversation About the Weather, this is a novel that evokes time, place and character through well-crafted tales, changing points of view clearly delineated, and intertwining connections offering readers the pleasant anticipation and surprise of discovery.Some of these tales and discoveries can be dark and haunting. Others offer more hope. But together the whole collection sheds a convincing and convicting light on mankind’s relationships and cruelties. With haunting prose, harsh details of history come to life, and the women of immigration find their voice and strength. Appropriately, this happens in a land where, as the final tale (by guest writer Shelly Davies) shows, “even thought it was the men who were out ithe front in the war parties, politicking and making speeches, women were a powerful influence. A force to be reckoned with.”Author Rebecca Burns may also be a force to be reckoned with, and this short novel deserves to be a classic.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCG9IP0EDLGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPI3VW0#wasThisHelpful","R2OCG9IP0EDLGQ","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bleakly cynical, brutally honest, and surreally irreverent, The Tragedy of Fidel Castro offers a sometimes uncomfortable juxtaposition of tragedy and comedy, raising Fidel Castro, FDR, and others to the status of myth as the gods look down or maybe intervene. “In their own muddled way, they’re both trying to imitate you,” says G to first-born son J, while Fatima listens and disparate threads come together.Long passages of introspection characterize this tale, combined with complex and conflicting motivations, mystical rumination, and the greater tragedy of human history, rendered magically surreal. Biblical parables and parallels abound. The madness of Nebachudnezzar repeats itself in a different frame. And diplomacy might be heaven’s only hope a well as mankind’s.The Tragedy of Fidel Castro is a long, slow, complex read, weightily self-conscious, with darkly tragi-comic humor, fierce determination, and a powerfully unsettling sense of unhinging divinities behind the scenes.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOD5GIEWS3CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATEPW00#wasThisHelpful","R1AOD5GIEWS3CV","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lori Benton brings the world of North America’s clashing cultures to life in this first novel of the Pathfinders series. The story is set in a time when America is moving toward independence, with great facts of history woven gently into the lives and concerns of everyday people. War’s accidental cruelties, loyalties unintentionally broken, and lives torn apart by actions that can’t be undone, all play their part. Meanwhile different faiths come into conflict, as Oneida tribesmen and women ponder the implications of the Christian Father Creator.The author weaves her Christianity seamlessly into this story. For some characters, it’s a vital part of their lives. For others it’s neglected or cruel. And for still others, faith is that thing which renders them unforgivably, permanently guilty and deserving of pain. But a father’s dream of vengeance is set against a parent’s unfailing love. A poor man’s need to hunt for food meets the rich man’s need for land. And the lives of tribe and settler begin to intertwine.I love how the author renders her characters’ worlds, thoughts and beliefs so vividly real. I love the innate generosity of their interactions. And I love the promise of hope, as life changes people and the world faces anger and pain. Well-timed, well-placed hints of scripture sing like the songs of Wales, while lovingly-told traditions of the older world offer a wonderful counterpoint. A girl who knows more medicine than men will allow, meets a man who needs more medicine than human care can give. Nature and nurture will come face to face with the contentment of acceptance. And nightmare’s dreams might come true.The story builds on human error, trusts in divine purpose, and stands its ground on the back stage of history. It builds to a perfect conclusion, not quite complete, but finished enough to leave the reader satisfied and eager for more. This will surely be a great series.Disclsoure: Blogging for Books provided this book to me for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCZY16YDJXTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PFD1C#wasThisHelpful","R2MCZY16YDJXTX","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1866, the Civil War was over and the gold rush was in full swing. Prospectors headed West and demanded protection from their government on the trail. But the trail to Montana’s gold rush territory went straight through lands belonging to the Oglala Lakota. And Red Cloud had no desire to see his people further hounded from the lands first given to them. The nation sought peace, but not peace at any price. Paul Goble’s simply told story offers insight into the price that would be paid.Told through the eyes of the fictional nineteen-year-old Brave Eagle, Red Cloud’s War invites young readers and listeners into the heart of a camp filled with talking and arguing, into the lives of chiefs and warriors who might desire peace and the white man’s gifts, but will not sell their heritage, and into the darkness of mistrust and war on ancient hunting grounds. Complex ideas are simply told and brought to life. Nicely drawn maps reveal what’s promised and denied. And the fighting that ensues is vividly described, frightening, cruel and implacable as white man’s boast meets a warrior’s determination.There’s no reveling in death and destruction in this tale, and no heavily weighted scorn for past mistakes. Rather it’s a nicely nuanced, well-told account, offered with convincing voice, and beautifully illustrated with images to capture the smallest and largest child’s attention. The author’s attention to detail is just as pure and convincing in his invitation to the Sun Dance as in the uniting of tribes for battle. Likewise, sorrow for the past is pleasingly balanced with genuine humanity and hope.A lovely book to read and share with children, this is a treasure for adults as well, revealing a past too often obscured or turned to myth and TV excitement.

"Lovely titles, beautifully organized, invite the reader into the pages of A F Stewart’s Colours of Poetry. The pages are filled with poems of many different forms, but the author creates a very natural feel in each form, and even, wisely, includes an explanation of poetic forms at the end.The organization of the poems follows the rules of poetry as surely as do the poems, with each new concept flowing naturally from the last. The Devil’s Deal – “A sky tongue / silver some may say ... and moonlight at the crossroads...” – might be my favorite. Or lyrical beauty might draw me in, as in, “Shall we dance with angels / far above the velvet clouds, / where the stars whisper light / and cast it to the eyes below?” But perhaps instead I’ll “spend our transitory sanity /chasing gilded gleams of hope,” Under the Midnight Sun.Tyrian Purple offers the cruelties of lost and broken loves, of wounded earth, and of histories colored with beauty, together with poetic hints of hope.But another favorite is Ashen, or maybe Horizon. Hope flows down through darkness as pages turn, and Ann’s Stardust Farewell offers shape and meaning as well as dedication for this collection. Colors of Poetry is a beautiful book, to dip into or to read page after page, haunting, absorbing, and beautifully drawn.Disclosure: I won a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BFAKTEPN1SQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UEP0NJO#wasThisHelpful","R3BFAKTEPN1SQ6","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heart of a Lion is probably my favorite Stephen Zimmer book to date, and not just because of the strong female lead protagonist. The novel offers a cool blend of real-world and fantasy, like Game of Thrones without the weighty politics. Convincingly different characters people lands that might almost belong to our own history. And blond Nordic Raven picks her fights and her loyalties, moving swiftly and surely through civilizations that feel hauntingly real.Starting nicely in the middle of her adventures, author Stephen Zimmer allows the reader to follow Raven’s journey back home from unknown action in southern lands. Neat details offer the chance to speculate about where she’s been and why, making this the sort of novel that sticks with you long after the reading’s done. Loyalties are tested, tied and broken, or tidily left behind, avoiding that agony of continued protection or unchallenged inconvenience, and making Raven achingly human and real. But she’s more than that. She’s a hero with heart, a fighter with soul, and a clever tactician with a willingness to listen and a mind to question the unknown.Slowly, more bits of that complex unknown reveal themselves, as darkness gathers and the tale continues. Pleasingly lyrical passages of description are nicely juxtaposed with fast, well-choreographed action scenes, and convincing introspection. Fight and flight are equally convincing and human, while satisfying strengths and wise changes of heart raise the novel far above the norm. Read on to a perfect ending, relax and sigh, then prepare for more because that darkness is still gathering, and war will come.I’m eager to read the next in the series. This is seriously cool fantasy with a wonderful lion-hearted hero.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10K7Q1HDRGUV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T44R6LE#wasThisHelpful","R10K7Q1HDRGUV7","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you liked Jean Auel’s Earth’s Children series, or Kathleen Flannigan’s Misfits and Heroes, and you like fast reads, you will probably enjoy Harper Swan’s Raven’s Choice. First in the Replacement Chronicles, it blends past and present, combining stories of cause with effect as a young man at a present day conference learns the mysteries hidden in DNA.Back in the past, a young woman who feels as surely out of place as her present-day counterpart, faces the struggle to fit into a changing society without the protection of a husband. The story is starkly true to life, well-researched, and pleasingly convincing. Raven has a choice to make, and someone always has to be first; someone must surely be the ancestor, and the ancestor’s decision might ring its results over farflung times.By the end of this novella, Raven’s unclear future has a definite direction. Readers will be satisfied to have seen and guessed her choice, but will still want more. Hopefully that is what the author will offer. But this bite-sized piece stands alone as an intriguing, fast-told novella of small decisions and major implications, in a convincingly drawn, hard and beautiful, distant world.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EWVUEAUAPC1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QOGLFVM#wasThisHelpful","R3EWVUEAUAPC1A","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amanda Marie’s Torii takes readers from mythic beginnings in a land of tragedy, sorrow and sword, to a world of rich teenagers in modern-day Miami. These times and places are linked, but the modern teen has a certain unwillingness to accept things beyond their ken, and a race to save the world is on, dependent on the love of cars and dogs and the friendship of strangers. Of course, some of these strangers will be considerably stranger than others as the novel progresses.Torii is beautifully presented on the page with nicely scripted chapter headings and well-measured space. The characters are youthful and fun, and the writing is fast, racing with equal swiftness through confusion, identities, excitement and flying simulations. Soon Mayuri and Killian pilot their vehicles with strangely mythical friends, carefully remembering “No red button,” and “flying for a hundred miles, avoiding normal things like birds, mountains, and other planes.” Their view of the world is somewhat changed.Think Ender’s Game, crossed with Twilight, a touch of Harry Potter, a pinch of Tokein’s worlds, and maybe even some time travel, all youthfully, breathlessly told. Betrayal, evil foes, wrong-headed friends, plus the chance to be “no longer part of the human world.” It’s a heady mix. No wonder “Mayuri’s heart erupted in her ears” while “Ty gripped her staff tighter, baring her teeth much like a dog would.”By turns scary, thrilling, imaginative, and sometimes even magical, Torii is a tale filled with a wealth of strange places and characters all pleasingly delineated to minimize confusion in a fascinating tortuous plot. Plus there’s that curious anchor to earth. And romance. And the promise of further tales to come.Disclosure: I won a free ecopy and I offer my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYTZN2NS8X8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KO10TI8#wasThisHelpful","R2SYTZN2NS8X8C","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of Teric Darken’s horror novels will know what to expect from this dark Christian tale of horror by K. R. Morrison. Aspects of faith are clearly and convincingly told, offering the truth that God doesn’t protect us from every danger, but does indeed, if unexpectedly, answer prayer.The story builds on a blend of Twilight with the everyday and middle age. Lydia is a convincing everywoman – no great heroine of life or of faith. But she faces challenges that blend darkness and light, leading to oceans of guilt and skies of forgiveness. When “[s]he crept down the hallway, noticing that her eyesight was immeasurably better in the dark than it used to be,” readers will know which way the darkness is flowing, but not how dark it will surely get. Still, Lydia will never be quite alone, and a Voice will comfort and guide her to exactly where she needs to be.K. R. Morrison’s novel explores questions of salvation and freewill, destiny, angels and more, while wearing the weighty cloak of traditional horror. The story builds to a truly terrifying climax, while creating an image of real and natural family life, dialog filled with the everyday, and calls to Mass and worship combined with divine calls to wait and obey.“Peace I leave with you. Do not fear.” Wise bishops, dark powers, dangerous forces, and powerful good stand arrayed at the end. Be Not Afraid is a slowly told tale, heavy on detail both natural and supernatural, accurate with very humanly distracted dialog, strong in faith, and haunting in terror. It’s a slow read, but offers plenty to enjoy and to think about.Disclosure: I won a free copy and I offer my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQ3EJOI4HM38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOFZD8U#wasThisHelpful","RZQ3EJOI4HM38","A36TDC5SGAN0EP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36TDC5SGAN0EP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The manufacturer sent me one of these to check out and test. I am usually pretty hesitant to review camera accessories because as you know there are a million companies out there. And they are all out there making their own version of the same thing.Selfie sticks range in cost from $10 to about $50 and I would venture to say that the majority of the people who use them automatically go for the cheapest one out there. Sandmarc has a reputation of being high quality and this does not disappoint. The first thing that I look at is the build quality you start at the handle and work your way up from there.The componentsThe Handle.5” long has a bicycle style (rubber) handgrip on It. What I like is that there is a positive stop at both the top and the bottom so that your hand won't slip off even if it's wet, It's about 1 1/4” wide which is extremely comfortable to hold. The handle also has an integrated strap which ensures that even if the stick gets knocked out of your hand you won't drop your expensive camera.The Extensions.The stick has two sections that extend out of the main section. The first section adds about 7.5” the second adds about 8.5” giving you a total length of 25” to where the camera mounts. What I really like is the round locks that keep the sections in place. They only require ¼ turn to lock or unlock and are made from a high quality aluminum which keeps the weight down but is still very strong.The MountThis is a standard mount for a GoPro camera has a nice adjustment screw to keep your camera secured. My one complaint with Sandmarc is that they do not make a universal adapter so that you can use this stick with other cameras as well as with your GoPro.OverallI just keep thinking that this is a beautifully made product it is simple, elegant,  durable and built with very high quality components. If you are serious about your videos you really need to be picky about your accessories and this is definitely one to check out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKNL50VFKNLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3SBXH4#wasThisHelpful","R1NKNL50VFKNLP","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a ton of USB chargers out there. Trying to decipher which is best is pretty darn close to impossible. This manufacturer sent me a sample to play with and see what I thought of it.Unit wise it's a standard brick style with a detachable 110v power cord. I tend to prefer these over the ones where the whole unit hangs on the wall for a few reasons but the main one is because I can plug it in remotely and sit it on my nightstand, desk or anywhere I may need it.  I use this type of charger in two places 1st is at home on my kitchen counter. This is where the kids plug in their Samsung 10"" tablets and an older Kindle fire. The second unit is in our master bedroom. It gets a Samsung 12' Tablet, two Samsung S4's and occasionally a set of Bluetooth headphones.I tested this charger in both spots and ran into no problems charging any devices. I saw that someone commented that they noticed a slightly longer charge time when all six ports are being used, I personally did not but I can see where if your devices are all trying to pull the maximum power from each port that it would in fact slow down the charge.One of the things that annoyed me in my last charger of this type is that on occasion it would not charge the Samsung 10"" galaxy Note tablets to 100%. It would take them to about 70% and then stop charging. This was very annoying and has not happened so far regardless fo which port is used on the device. If it pops up or any other problems arise I will update the review. Overall I'm happy with this item, It has performed as expected. In all honesty it's difficult to get excited about this type of product. In my experience with around 30 of this type of unit they either A. work well B, work decently or C. die when you plug them in. In my experience this type of purchase is usually a pretty good one as out of 30  I have only had one that stunk and one that died.Generally my rating system has always been 3 stars = meets expectations 4 or 5 = exceeds expectations and 1or 2 stars = it stinks.Unfortunately people don't seem to like that so It works well, It didn't start a fire I'll give it 4 stars.My only complaint with this unit is that just like most USB chargers on the market today. The current trend is towards larger screens, More powerful CPU's and definitely bigger battery capacities to keep up with all of that. So, My question is why would you short change your product by underpowering it? If some devices you know people will be using it require just shy of 2.5amps, why not spend the extra buck or two and make a 15amp charger that will charge any device at the fastest rate regardless of which port you use? That's my one gripeHope you found this helpful, If you have comments or questions please feel free to post them I usually answer them within 24 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJLDZCLEIFKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014W1H1A4#wasThisHelpful","RVJLDZCLEIFKT","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was given a sample of this a few months ago and because of work haven't been able to sit down and review it till now.This is a very neat little product, small at 2"" square has a full range speaker and a passive radiator that helps widen the sound spectrum and add a small amount of bass into the mix. Quality of this cube is on par with other Mango products that I have tested in the last year and they all have been rock solid with zero failures out of 6-8 products.This item is splash proof and has a spot where you can attach a keychain to it. Battery life is hard to tell but I got at least 4-5 hours before it stopped working and charging is simple with the included USB cable.Testing the product inside it created very good sound and quite loud levels of music, Outside it fell a bit short on volume but in all honesty I didi not expect the volume that it produces from such a tiny package.This works best for music but I did try it streaming a couple of shows from Hulu and it was very acceptable with adequate volume outside as long as the cube was within a few feet of where you were. While there was a very slight delay caused by the bluetooth signal it was minimal and did not bother me at all.Overall, If you want a tiny speaker that will most definitely outperform even the speakers on a large tablet (I tested this with a Samsung Note 12"" tablet).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8PN3Y8D37ALJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ7C0YI#wasThisHelpful","R8PN3Y8D37ALJ","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty simple product it is two straps that criss cross each other allowing you to ensure that your bag doesn't open up while being thrown around by careless baggage handlers.But that's not why I wanted one. For me the more important thing is being able to quickly identify my bag as it comes around the carousel. On my old luggage I took a can of yellow spray paint and sprayed the bottom of the bag. I did not want to do that with my new hardside luggage so this was a great alternative. Since my bags are blue in color the orange straps very nicely highlight the luggage making it super easy to tell which one is mine.They are not super cheap but they are well made. I will mention that they stink really bad when you first get them, It's hard to describe but kinda an oily smell that wore off within 24 hours.Overall it does what it advertises plus it makes your luggage more visible so it's a win win  I was able to use this even on my largest 28"" hardside spinner so should fit most bags.The vendor gave me a coupon for this purchase for reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9YYC8YEPDG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151C7GD0#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9YYC8YEPDG0","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got one of these as a reviewing sample and while I have reviewed a ton of bluetooth headphones I have only had teh opportunity to test one other Bluetooth mini boombox such as this.I was quite shocked at how loud this thing is I tested it with one of our Samsung Galaxy Noe Tablets and it performed very well. When testing Bluetooth devices I like perform 3 tests. First is the easy one which is music. Music has nothing to look at which means there is no delay which affects video playback when using radio communications.So Music. The device played back music effortlessly. It achieved surprising volume and had very good bass response from such a small device. When you look at the unit you can see that there are two speakers pointing forward and two passive radiators shooting directly downward. What I found interesting is that the manufacturer fails to take full advantage of the units capabilities by only placing rubber pads on the bottom of the unit. You can improve the sound quality by placing something in the middle of the unit to lift it up off the surface so that the radiators can emit more sound.Video playback.I tested the unit while streaming a movie from Netflix. I found that there was a slight delay but it was very tolerable. You can clearly see that the lips and sound are out of alignment but it did not bother me.Game playback. This is where the delay between what you see on the screen and what you hear bothered me the most. While playing a game you can clearly see your character do something but the related sound definitely has a very perceivable delay.Bonus test. Computer or laptop speaker. This unit has a standard stereo input connection. I was able to simply connect my laptop to it and get much improved sound quality while watching Netflix.What's included:1x USB cable1x mini stereo connectorStar ratingEven though I found the delay annoying during game playback I really liked how the unit performed. I found that it was definitely loud enough to use outside which the previous and much smaller unit I tested was not. I also liked the fact that there was the ability to connect your device directly completely bypassing the problems that Bluetooth brings to the table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AAD4X2607IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RT3I4TK#wasThisHelpful","R14AAD4X2607IC","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the process of writing a review for this product. I stopped to take a few pictures of the bulb and as I wiped it with a dry rag it fell apart. You can read the review that was in process when this happened  but I can not recommend this product.Look at the LE 5 watt 10 pack  Amazon ID B00IXG3S0CI have been testing LED lights now for almost ten years. The opportunity to check out a new release in a category already crowded with competitors from both name brands such as Philips, CREE  and the  numerous Import brands from overseas was really something I was excited about.My first LED Candelabra base bulb was only rated for two watts and produced an ugly blueish white color. Since then the power output of each new generation has increased bringing this type of bulb into the mainstream and makes switching from the old fashioned Incandescent bulbs of yesterday to today's high tech, low power LED's of tomorrow an easy and economically sound decision.This bulb worried me when I opened the package. In my experience with this type of bulb, The ones that use multiple tiny LED chips mounted on the surface generally have quality and longevity issues. On the 50 or so bulbs that I have tested I have found a much higher failure rate when many chips are used when compared to bulbs that use 1 large LED chip.The reason for this is usually that something goes wrong, either within the wiring connecting all the chips or with the chips themselves. You can see this by simply reviewing other peoples experience with this product as at least one reports some of the chips failing.Now to be clear NONE of the chips have failed on the sample I was provided, However I will also note that in the week that I have had the bulb in use it has only seen about 36 hours of use.My last LED bulb purchase (Jan 21st 2015) of this type of bulb was for the LE brand 10 pack which retails here on Amazon for $52.99. Comparing the two bulbs shows some stark differences between the two technologies.So the Lohas bulb (This one) does appear significantly brighter when you look at it in the fixture. However when comparing the actual amount of light emitted by the bulb by holding a sheet of bright white paper next to it shows a few things.1. The bulb outputs more light out to the sides. This is very evident as there is at least a 15% when compared to the 5 watt competitor from LE.2. The bulb produces almost no light through the tip of the bulb_________________This is when the bulb broke, end of review.I was given a free sample for review purposes","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSW8TVUW2NNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JZ2JC4#wasThisHelpful","RCSW8TVUW2NNM","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a set of these to check out and review. I have tested now about 8-9 sets of Bluetooth headsets and these rival them all in tems of sound and weight however they do have some caveats.Sound qualityIn order to test any wireless headphone or speaker I put them through 3 tests.1. Music. Playback of Sirius radio or Pandora  was excellent. The headphones reproduce a wide spectrum of sound and unlike many wireless headphones these have excellent bass response.2. Video Game. I played several games and noticed a very slight delay. The updated signal capability of Bluetooth 4.1 pretty much means that the delay is negligible. There was only one instance where the delay was noticeable and annoying and that was when in a game I held my finger on the""buy"" icon and the constant sound of change clicking was very annoying. Other than that the delay was very tolerable and did not really present a problem. Sound quality while playing a game was also excellent. I like to play racing games and most of teh headphones I have tested in the past had zero bass when the engines roared with these there was a good amount.3. Movies both on device and streamed. A slight delay is noticeable and seemed more prevalent when the movie was streamed rather than loaded on the device. This is most likely the dual effect of streaming and having to send and decode the bluetooth signal. It wasn't bad and as I said earlier overall it was the least annoying of all the wireless headsets I have tested. If I were to describe it I would say there is a millisecond between when let's say an explosion happens on the screen and the sound comes out of the headset. It's there if you look for it but otherwise it's not bad.Other observations.The last set of Bluetooth headsets I tested had a rigid (and short) wire between the two headpieces. These have a rather long and very soft wire going between them. The ones with the rigid wire loop over your ears to keep the headset in place these do not they merely pressure fit in place.  Personally for workout purposes I prefer the ones with the over the ear rigid wire. These I had to keep putting them back in and then sometimes if you push them too far the rubber shroud over the speaker blocks the sound and you have to pull them out just a hair.Comfort and in ear feel.Each headset has a little rubber band that kinda holds onto the inner ear lobe to hold the pieces in your ear. The box contains several extras, I am not sure if they are different sizes and some have mentioned, they look to be the same size. I found the inner round part that goes in your ear to be uncomfortable. It seemed to be slightly too large for me but I should also state that I generally find in ear headsets to be uncomfortable.Overall.I really liked the sound, not so big on the thin long wire between them. I also found the USB cover on the headset to be hard to remove I had to pick at it for a few seconds before I just decided to use a knife to pry the cover off (That's really just nit picking though).

"The best product available for tough lawn issues.Every once and awhile you get a client who has let their lawn go just a bit too long and has gotten themselves overwhelmed with weeds or Crabgrass.This is a great product. However, I would not recommend it to the average homeowner (this is a group 4 Herbicide it's serious stuff) until they have exhausted all other options (see note below). However if you have tried the regular stuff from Bayer, Scotts and Spectracide and none have worked for you then this is your next step.Take into consideration that this product can not just be sprayed down. This needs to be applied in conjunction with a  methylated seed oil. I would recommend using  DyneAmic Surfactant with it. I liek that this product is pet safe (follow the included directions) and that it is fast acting and you will see results within 5-7 days. However beware that it can not be applied to all lawns the manufacturer clearly states"" DO NOT apply to Bahiagrass, carpetgrass, St. Augustinegrass, centipedegrass, dichondra, or lawns or turf where desirable clovers are present"". My personal recommendation before you head down this route is to try a product called QuinKill Max Crabgrass and Weed Killer. It is available here on Amazon  B00NPBJKJS.What it comes down to is crabgrass is an annual plant that can easily be controlled if you follow some basic steps.https://www.amazon.com/review/R35UYTNX8KUQ4V/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permHope you find this helpful, please feel free to ask questions I try to answer them within 24 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14H12J1BRNSOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRH85RO#wasThisHelpful","R14H12J1BRNSOC","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Chicago and even though there are a ton of bike lanes and bike trails scattered throughout the city and surreounding suburbs you still end up in the street quite a bit.These are small 1"" round battery powered LED's that are mounted to your bike with a rubber mounting band. The band is adjustable to go around anything from your seat post to the main frame. The lights themselves merely fit snugly into the mounting band and then you simply latch the band to itself and you are ready to ride.The lights have three modes. Constant on, Fast flash and slow flash. I tend to prefer the slow flash but that is personal preference.There are both things I really like about these and one thing that concerns me about them.Likes1. Increases your safety by 1000% They are very visible even in daylight2. Easily mounts to any bike.3. easily removes so that you can use them on multiple bikes. (has a caveat)4. Very easy to replace batteries, mine even came with extra batteries (haven't needed them yet!)5. no wiring! I love that fact! (you can buy a 20 pack of energizer flat batteries for these for $12 on that popular auction site) I estimate that the provided batteries should last you a whole season.DislikesSo living in Chicago means you have to deal with people. Old people, Young people, Kids and Teenagers. Basicly a boat-load of people. Some of those folks not very nice. I use a Kryptonite chain which I kid you not is heavier than my bike. So my complaint here? Just as easy as it is to mount these to your bike in .25 seconds it's also just as easy for that teenager to steal them off your bike just for the fun of it.  Personally I would have preferred something with a hard plastic mount that required at minimum a screwdriver to put on and take off.Now I did not use that negative against my rating because I know that if the bike is out of my sight I just snap them off. Overall I really like these lights they are a simple way to increase your safety.

"I received an email from this vendor asking if I wanted to try one of these out. I try to be picky at what I review. Basicly if teh product is not something I would use i tend to stay away from them.I have been wanting to buy one if these for quite a while, just never really went out and did it. After receiving the unit we went out to Costco and bought a 2 pack of hand soap.  I opened the package and unboxed the unit. My first impressions of the unit were that it felt cheap and very lightweight. It comes in two pieces the main housing and the little feet that hold it upright. The feet are removable so that you can insert the 4 sized AA batteries.Powering up the unit is easy it has a power button on the top of it. You push the power button and mine immediately started to run the motor. The unit took a few waves of the hand before soap actually came out of it as the pump needed to prime itself.So before we got this we had been buying the $1 plastic soap pumps that you get at Walmart or Target. My complaint about those it that the kids seemed to always go through a ton of soap. It just seemed like we ended up replacing those bottles after two to three weeks. Wahat I like about this unit is that it pumps out a consistent amount of soap. For me personally I think it's slightly less soap than I would like but as far as the kids are concerned I am very happy with how much it spits out (I sometimes find myself double dipping).So here is what I like about the unit.1. Hold a good amount of soap.2. Doesn't seem to get played with by the kids compared to the small plastic bottles that they make a mess with.3. Dispenses just the right amount of soap for the kids.4 looks ok.5. so far it has worked flawlessly.Some negatives1. not adjustable (amount of soap it dispenses)2. Casing feels cheap3. not a fan of chromeOverall. I am giving the product 4 stars. Mainly because it has worked so well in the last week. (I will update if that changes). I really love the concept and am torn between buying 3 more of these or choosing another brand.

"I received one of these from the manufacturer for reviewing purposes.My entertainment system is located in the kitchen, But the TV and speakers are in the family room. I did this because we had a cabinet that was not being used in the kitchen and did not want components visible in the family room. I have used many HDMI cables, My personal preference has been towards Blue Rigger Brand for years. I've also never purchased one that is flat before and that drew me to taking a closer look at this one.I'm going to break this down to 3 categories 1. Build quality 2. signal transfer and 3. Overall usefulness.So1. Build qualityThe cable is 35 feet long it has industry standard gold plated connectors on each end. The cable itself measures only 1/8"" thick by 1/2"" wide. so compared to the standard cable that is 3/8"" round it is very easy to conceal. Just as you would expect from any good quality cable the ends are properly attached and they feature strain relief fittings to prevent damage when the cable is flexed.2. Signal transferThis one is hard to test without proper equipment as you would expect it easily transferred a 1080P signal from my Denon AVR4520ci with no issues. However, I did test the cable for signal interference and results were mixed results. I laid the cable out (on the floor) from the kitchen to the family room connected it to the receiver and my Sharp Aquos television. I ran a Bluray through it to an as expected excellent picture. However when I played with a 110v extension cord or the DC adapter to my children's Xbox 360 charger the cable picked up some interference which showed up as distortion on the TV. Now in all fairness when I ran 4 HDMI cables from my media cabinet to the family room I did not test them in the same way. Secondly I don't have an unused one to test either so it may be something that happens with all HDMI cables.3. Overall UsefulnessSo as far as cables go it is a well built unit. What was a major turn off for me is two fold. First is labeling. Here is what I mean by that. I pick up a competitors cable and on the cord it says the following "" High Speed HDMI tm Cable with Ethernet E329703 (UL)TYPE CL3 75*C  26 CSA250674 CMG 26AWG FT4""So what does this cable say? ""High Speed Cable""So which one would you pick? Well here are two things that the labeling tells me. 1. UL Underwriters Laboratory, now do ALL electrical devices need to be UL listed? No. But, it tells me they took that extra step. 2. CL3, What does that mean? well it means that the cable is suitable for running through a wall. Remember I said that my media cabinet was in the Kitchen? Well I used 50' CL3 cables to run down into the basement ran them to the family room and then back up to provide a clean installation. This particular cable is not suitable for that purpose.ConclusionIf you just need to run between point A and point B and NOT go into a wall this is a great cable. Personally I don't see a huge demand for such a long cable that is not CL rated but I may be wrong. Quality construction is there the lack of labeling is a huge turn off for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NVLJVPAKFTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BRJ7JK#wasThisHelpful","R12NVLJVPAKFTS","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a small flashlight that was powerful. I already had some 18650 batteries so this was a perfect fit. I knew it was not going to be 2000 lumen as advertised but expected it to be at least half that.So right out of the box it feels very lightweight. I have several other flashlights from Duracell, Securitying etc.. So when compared to the Duracell for instance which is rated at 1000 lumen it's pretty pathetic. This produces nowhere near the brightens of the Duracell. Regardless of the zoom level it just doesn't come close to being as bright as the 1000 lumen Duracell.But there is more the LED on this emits a very blue light. I am used to flashlights that produce a high Kelvin color of 5000k but this is beyond that and is into the blue spectrum.Overall the build quality is not bad but as I mentioned when compared to other flashlights it just seems very lightweight.I'm going to try to return mine but since it's a non-Prime purchase I don't see that happening without having to pay shipping.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AC03M9KJ5B9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7H5JS4#wasThisHelpful","R2AC03M9KJ5B9R","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these to illuminate a small loft area in our master bedroom Right now I have fluorescent tubes up there and they make a lot of noise for a bedroom (very loud hum).I ordered two of these in warm white and am pleasantly surprised by how bright they are. I am powering them with a JACKY LED 120 watt Power supply  B00IF4WYOS and it powers the two strips very well. (they are no-where near as bright as the 4x 8 foot florescent tubes but they are warm white not that terrible bright white and as I said they do not produce any sound.I have used other bulbs that incorporate the 5730 LEDs and they seem to be much brighter than any other LED currently available. I have tested the smaller 3528 and 5050's and these are the best so far.I have only been using this setup for a short while. So I can't really comment on longevity. However I agree with what others have said regarding the tape on these. The tape is absolutely terrible! First off my two reels where super sticky as the glue from the tape had gotten on the lights and was quite messy. then as I unrolled the lights it became apparent that the tape was not applied properly and had gaps in coverage seen as areas where the tape was completely pulled away from the rolled light strip. As I tried to lay the lights flat onto the ledge the tape completely separated from the lights and even after I managed to put it back the tape failed to hold onto a flat horizontal surface. You would have thought since the tape was merely holding the strip in place and not supporting any of its weight it would have been ok, but nope!I'd recommend getting some of that white foam 3m tape from an auto parts store if you need to hold this on a vertical surface. You may also need to use some mineral spirits to clean off the gummy residue that the cheap tape leaves.Overall I am somewhat happy the power supply and these two lights were $60 and I do not have that annoying hum of fluorescent bulbs. However, the tape issue is just a total mess with these and it took far longer to complete the project because I had to deal with it and teh residue it left all over the lights.Light output =5 starsmounting tape 1 star","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5R6ZFGVVCJZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVCNDS2#wasThisHelpful","R5R6ZFGVVCJZ1","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using Insteon Keypadlinc and switches for the last 10+ years. Basicly when they came out I started switching from the old X-10 switches to those from Smarthome.Right now I have 3 keypadlincs in my kitchen with another in the family room and another 6 scattered throughout the house. In teh last 10 or so years I have lost two keypads. Not sure what causes them to die but it happens. I have already swapped out my Keypadlincs once already. The first series did not have built in radio communication as the new ones do they were powerline transmission only. My home is 3000 SF and was built 12 years ago and for the most part I have never had any problems even when I was using the old switches and keypads.The new switches are much improved they are a bit heavier duty with much improved reception thanks to receiving signals both wirelessly and through the power lines.If I were to have a complaint I guess it would be that the old ones had clear plastic buttons so that you could print your own labels. In fact I took clipart of each light that we installed from google pics, made it tiny to fit the ( i think it was like 50x50 pixels) so each button had custom pictures of what they were controlling.I'm not super big into the home automation thing I just liek to be able to turn lights on from the next room, it's very convenient.I have considered switching from Insteon to Z-wave but it all comes down to 2 things. Ist I like the way the keypadlincs look. And 2, They are simple and do what I need them to do without a hub or jumping through any major hoops to get them to work.Overall I am quite happy, I have been starting to look around to see what is out there but as far as keypads with a built in switch nothing catches my eye.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEYMHU5ROMLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ICY0OY#wasThisHelpful","R2XEYMHU5ROMLN","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am usually not the one who needs this as I am pretty big on regular maintenance and following one of the 4 step systems out there.This year however I've had some health issues which have prevented me from doing much of the spring cleanup that I normally do. And as a result of not being out there I suddenly found myself being overrun by crabgrass and other nuisance weeds.So the first thing you notice is that this comes with hands down the best sprayer I have ever used. Unlike the ones on Scotts brand products that seem weak this one can shoot a nice powerful spray as fa as 8-9 feet. I also really liked that the product is dyed red so that is is easier to tell where it is being applied, I just think the combination of the two really makes a world of difference.So as far as weed killers go it seems to work pretty darn well. I will point out that it does take a while so if you think that you are going to spray it and come back the next day to a brown weed that is bent over you're setting yourself up for a huge disappointment. Realisticly it will take a week for it to die off completely and I would recommend not pulling it until it is dead as you want to make sure you kill the roots which are what propagate and cause more to shoot up.Overall I am very happy with this product, the only thing that works better is round up but that can't be used on or near lawn and other plants as it kills everything near it. I actually learned that the hard way as I used to spray roundup on Canada Thistle that gre in my flower bed and even though I was very careful I must have gotten some on my two bushes as they both died within weeks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6Z4JACGXJ1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TTEHCU#wasThisHelpful","R1J6Z4JACGXJ1O","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a VacuMaid GV50BLKPRO. This was one of the tools that came with it. Unfortunately two things work against this brush the first is that unlike most dust brushes that are available which are circular in shape (hole is round with brushes around it) this one is oval and has a maximum width (front to back) of about 5/8"" across.So what end up happening when you use the tool is the bristles get sucked together and cause it to pretty much block itself..I ended up ordering Amazon  B00RY4F89S, They are 2 for $10 and even though they are cheaper made (thinner plastic) than the Cen Tec ones they work much better.So while it's well made, it's very poorly designed you can't have an oval shape with such a small opening and not expect the bristles to get sucked into the device itself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVO5DUO9MKPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLWJITK#wasThisHelpful","R2RVO5DUO9MKPI","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought our unit almost 10 years ago. This is easily the best kitchen purchase we have ever made. We make everything from pizzas to fish sticks on this thing!Want to make a perfect pizza? super easy, set on ""bottom"" and cook for about 20 minutes then set to top & bottom and cook for another twenty minutes and tada (use a knife to lift edge of pizza when it's done to your liking it's ready), Makes absolutely perfect pizzas! You may have to play with the time a bit based on how thick your pizzas are (unaltered pizzas take less, if you dish on extra topping it will take longer).We get basic pizzas at Costco or Sam's Club and we dress them up with mushrooms, cut up breakfast sausage, pineapple, barbecue sauce  etc.. depending on what the kids are in the mood for.Looking for fries or onion rings? easy to do on this as well just use the ""both"" setting for even cooking.My Favorite pizza1. cheap cheese or cheese and pepperoni from Costco.2. spread out a very thin layer of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (available anywhere, Walmart, costco, Menards).3. Open a can of sliced chunk pineapple, slice the chunks in half and spread evenly.4. add meat of your choice, cooked bacon or breakfast sausage works great but we have even used cut up chicken nuggets or small cut up pieces of deli honey sweet ham.5. add mushrooms or greens if desired6. top it all off with a thin layer of shredded mozzarella cheese!7. cook about 20min bottom 20min on both and enjoy!Like I said fish sticks work great on this I use a thin layer of cooking spray on the platter to ensure nothing stocks. Same with french fries or onion rings.So what makes this thing work? It's pretty much an industrial hair dryer with a turntable. As the platter spins the hot air is blown onto the pizza. You can select three modes top, both or bottom. Depending on which you pick determines is which element(s) turn on.If I were to have one complaint? I wish the unit was just a few inches larger, while I've never found a frozen pizza that did not fit It does not fit the ready made pizzas at Sam's Club or Costco.Overall we love our unit it has worked flawlessly for over 10 years and if it ever died we would replace it within one heartbeat.5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYFX1IA48KSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005IBXJ#wasThisHelpful","RPYFX1IA48KSA","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample for reviewing purposes.So I have to say I do not dive. So I honestly can not speak to how this is for that purpose. I did however test this in a pool for 30 minutes and then disassembled it to see how it faired and it does seem to be waterproof.Construction of the flashlight is first class, solid aluminum body with 3 protective O-rings.  The light features a glass (not plastic) lens and a single LED. I was actually very impressed with this light. My wife bought me a Duracell LED flashlight for Christmas that also claims to be 1000 lumens. When you shine the two side by side however it's night and day. The Securtying flashlight vastly outshines the Duracell. While the Duracell has multiple modes ie: high, med and flash, this unit main feature is a simple ridiculously bright beam. While I really like the Duracell that my wife bought me I do have a huge gripe about it. When you use it the unit kicks out of high mode and into medium from time to time. It then switches back and fourth during prolonged use. The Securitying flashlight luckily does not do that, you simply twist it on and it works.Dimensions9"" long1 7/8"" wide12"" long strap with 7"" padded collarFeatures1. single powerful LED that does not overheat2. solid aluminum construction with real glass lens3. 3 O Ring seal4. handy adjustable strap5. operates on 3 C sized batteriesNegativesDoesn't float?

"I originally had a Cab Cool dual 80mm fan setup in my media cabinet. But I upgraded to a Denon Avr4520ci receiver a few years ago and to my shock and disappointment Denon stopped putting AC outlets on the back of their receivers! Back when I had my Denon Avr 4310ci it came with a switched outlet which was nice because I just plugged the fans power supply in and every time the amp turned on the fans turned on.The fans on this AC Infinity unit are much larger at 120mm vs 80mm however being low powered USB fans they don't spin anywhere near as fast and therefore do not move anywhere near as much air as the Cab Cool products did. Unfortunately I never bothered to keep the Cab Cool's thermal sensor (did not think I needed it) whcih is why this upgrade was unfortunately necessary.Product wise the components are pretty simple and straight forward (pretty much off the shelf). The fan unit has a brushed black aluminum plate, 2 USB fans and 2 metal perforated grills. I personally think the appearance would be much nicer if they used grills with tiny holes versus the larger holes that allow you to see the fans but that is just my personal preference.I like the fact that these come with two plastic templates so that you know what size hole to cut out. I do wish the templates were not clear plastic as I made the mistake of putting the small one on the floor and it took me several minutes to find it as it basically is pretty much invisible when placed on flooring material.InstallationOverall installation was quick and easy. My only complaint would be that they fail to provide black wood screws for the installation. My set did not come with any screws to install the controller and the fan unit came with only black screws that were not wood screws but had an accompanying nut that needed to be attached from the back (kinda a pain in the butt). Simple 1/2"" black wood screws would have made it much easier to put in.PerformanceI did not notice any vibrations or loud noise from the kit. The fans run smooth and in fact my disappointment is that even when in high it is not really a high but more of a low as far as compared to typical computer fans. I really wish the high setting would have moved much more air and that they reserved the lower two settings for those who did not want to hear any noise. Since my media cabinet is in another room I don't care if the fans are loud as long as they are keeping the equipment cool.SettingsI placed my thermal sensor directly on top of my receiver. I set it to turn on high at 85 degrees. What this means is that pretty much 4-5 minutes after the receiver powers up the fans kick on, it also means the fans run about 10-15 minutes after the unit is turned off which seems to work out pretty well for me.Upgrade.I just placed an order for the AC Infinity AI-CFD120BA which is the two 120mm fan add on kit. I plan to take it apart and reverse the two fans so that instead of blowing air out they suck air into the cabinet. I hope this will aid in the cooling of my cabinet. I do have more equipment than most people because the cabinet holds the Denon receiver which is setup for 4 different zones which are powered by 2 Sonance multi channel amps and two Sonance sub-amps which power in-wall subwoofers.I will update the review with how that works out. OverallI am happy with this purchase, It was inexpensive (relatively) and works pretty decently. My complaints overall would be the lack of power. I am hoping that by adding the intake fans onto the cabinet it will solve some of the heat issue. I really do like the convenience of the control panel however, finding a spot to mount it may be difficult for some. It's deep, measuring in at almost an inch and a half thick and that is not even taking into consideration the USB plugs that need to be connected into the back of it.I am giving it 3 stars, basically 1 star off for low speed fans (being under-powered) and 1 star off for not providing screws for the controller. If I were to rate it on just performance alone I would have to say it does it's job but doesn't exceed at it, so 3 stars there as well (The cab cool product also cost $60 and even with smaller fans moved 2-3 times more air).I hope you found this review helpful.

The battery pack can charge any USB powered device, phone, tablet, GPS, pretty much anything. But let's say your device doesn't have a USB connection? No problem! Plug in the 9"" pigtail find the connector that fits your device and tada! your in business! I also think it's cool that those connectors will work on the included cigarette lighter, the options to power your stuff are almost limitless!I tested this product by charging a Samsung 10.1"" pro tablet, no problem took it from 0 to 100% in about 4 hours and still had 2/3rds power left. I then hooked it up to a snowblower (only thing I have that is battery started) and even with the blowers 12v battery completely dead it  turned it over and started it.I hate giving products 5 stars. But this is a really neat device 12k mah chargers run about $30-$40. so paying a bit more for one that can do so much doesn't seem like a bad investment. There a few ""unknowns"" for instance, How long will the battery last if left in a glove-box?  Will it start a car in the dead of winter? A combination of those two questions. These can only be answered after long term use and testing. I did think it was impressive that it jump started the snow blower which has had a dead battery for over a year (I used the pull starter this last winter, was too cheap to buy a new $60 battery for it).Very cool device and I will put it through more paces this summer as we begin our trips around the country.

"I received a free sample of this product. I don't understand why folks are complaining about it. It is big. Measuring (closed) at 4 7/8 inches wide by 4 inches tall and about 1/2"" thick. Now compared to my Carhartt wallet that measures 4"" wide and 3 1/2"" tall it's definitely big but if you carry a lot of junk than you need something that is going to hold it all!So what's cool about it?1. 2 Clear pockets to hold ID's. That's just sweet I work for the government so the ability to keep my work identification and my DL readily available is priceless.

It's stamped genuine leather. I think the only thing that is real leather is the piece that is stamped that. But in all fairness it's hard to tell, it smells like leather but honestly who the heck knows? My guess, for under $10 it's ""imported leather"".2. So my biggest pet peeve about this product is that it does not lay flat on a table. The way the leather/ plastic/ vinyl, (whatever it is) is cut it ends up with this huge 1/2"" lump that does not allow it to lay flat.3. has some funky slots cut into the interior with the initials P, D & B, what's with that? at forst I thought they were to hold emergency keys but that's not it.So what's the deal?I've been using a wallet now for almost 30 years. I tend to be hard on them and usually get a new one every year or so. The last wallet I bought was a Carhartt two tone which at the time cost me $35. Here we are a year later and it looks pretty beat up. This thing costs less than $10!It's well made, yes it's fake leather.

"I love black mulch, I think it makes the landscape pop as the color from your plants just gets framed beautifully, you just end up with such wonderful contrast when you start with black and add shades of green and bright hues from flowers to it.The downside is it has taken me years and i mean years to find a good quality black mulch (local landscape company makes it near me). They use a ton of dye in it and it holds it's color for a good time. Unfortunately as you know nothing stays beautiful forever. Sooner or later that gorgeous black turns grey and eventually the brown wood underneath start to poke though.I have actually used this colorant before. Several years ago I bought some brown and it worked really well. So knowing that the brown was a great product I went ahead and ordered black to cover up my graying mulch.Overall works fantastic, it takes a few minutes to do but the results? just like fresh mulch. I do recommend fluffing the mulch as it tends to get a hard layer on the top that way when you spray it looks nice and loose and fresh. I use a cheap sprayer that I bought here on amazon for under $15. I will point out that you should NEVER put your sprayer away without cleaning it out first. otherwise your going to be throwing your sprayer out.Cleanup is easy just warm water.As I get older I find myself not wanting to shovel mulch every year. So with this I can do it every other year and enjoy my spring just a bit more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R313DH5LPZPI1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5UQCFG#wasThisHelpful","R313DH5LPZPI1B","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The battery also has a pigtail on it that is 24"" long so overall when you connect the battery and the light the wire between the two is  54"" so finding a spot to mount it on your bike should be quite easy.So the light on this is RIDICULOUS! I have a Duracell Ultra LED flashlight. I thought that was super bright but it is nowhere near as bright as this light is. When I shine the two side by side this one is at minimum 3x brighter plus I really like the color of light that this produces a pure very high (probably 5000K) light temperature which pierces through blackness and illuminates anything in your path.So there are a lot of positives and unfortunately some negatives.The big wins.1. super bright, to the point where it is blinding.2. adjustable. Has 3 settings high, medium and emergency flasher3. fully rechargeable (even comes with the charger!)4. I was very impressed by the construction, It feels like a nice high end Maglight or similar high end flashlight.5. Power button has an LED indicator green for charged. very nice.Unfortunately the negatives1. I received a sealed box but there was no manual2. I did not get any mounting rings to attach to a bike.I emailed the company to see about the mounting hardware will upgrade the review when I hear back from them.When I get the mounting rings I will try it out on a couple of bikes and update the review.The last thing I want to point out is that my Duracell flashlight kicks in and out of high mode when the led gets warm. This did not do that I set it to bright and it stayed bright as long as I had the unit on.Thank for reading if you have a question or comment please post it in my comments and I usually respond within 24 hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WC3ZPV0C90U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICYUXIA#wasThisHelpful","R2WC3ZPV0C90U9","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is made from 100% real Bamboo. Even though I read through the negative reviews from people who have no idea what they are talking about I decided to buy one.Bamboo grows as a hollow round tube. It is sliced into slats that are approximately 1/8"" wide and can be as long as the Bamboo stalk is (generally about 12"").Once you have a stack of these slats they are then glued together to make boards, planks or in this case a block. Bamboo can be glued together either vertically or horizontally each of these two techniques will give the end product a completely different look. (Vertical grained glue ups have very little grain and present a very linear appearance, meanwhile Horizontal glue ups show much more grain and that little Bamboo detail (little ziggly lines) that we all recognize as bamboo).This particular product is made by gluing the Bamboo vertically. You can clearly see this in the product as it appears to be made up of tiny strips. Some people are mistakenly stating that the product is made from veneer. This is false as veneer is paper thin sheets of wood. Hardwood trees can be cut into boards or planks as they are solid inside. The cutting mill simply decides what cuts are the most efficient (get the most linear feet out of that particular tree) and then a trunk is milled or re-sawed to make the boards. This of course can n ot be done with Bamboo as it is once again hollow in the middle.So let's look at the actual product.Size9"" at the tallest point10"" long (across the bottom)4 7/8"" wideSlots3.5"" at the top of unit2x 2"" wide on left2x 1 1/2"" on the right1 1/2"" on left1 1/4"" on the right2x 1"" towards the bottom1 1/4"" by  1/2"" slot for scissors8x steak knife slots are approx. 7/8"" wideAll slots go all the way through the block and are open at the bottom.WorkmanshipVery good overall, I did notice that a few slots have some rough spots where the slot was machined but they did not take the time to sand it down properly. Not a big deal does not effect its ability to hold knives.OverallI am giving the product 5 stars. The main reason is value. A solid wood block that is well built and costs under $20!Yes better blocks are available but cost much more. As a side note to those people who complain that their knives don't fit, that's not the blocks fault, it's theirs for not measuring before buying. This for me was a very good purchase at a ridiculously great deal. (Under $20 with Prime shipping).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOLZM8AJVOIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHH0LRA#wasThisHelpful","RIOLZM8AJVOIZ","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received a free sample in exchange for an honest reviewI have now tested something like 5-6 different blutooth enabled headsets.This is the second pair of in ear headsets (see my other reviews) and there are a few differences between the two.Pros1. easy setup, same as others, hold the power button down until it says ""pairing"".2. Much more comfortable, I can actually wear these without my ears hurting3. Much better sound quality including slightly better bass response. *1Cons1. Slightly smaller wire connecting the two headsets may not fit people with large heads.2. poor button placement3. buttons are ridiculously smallLet's look at the basicsSound QualitySound was very good when compared to other headsets in the category. The sound was clear and crisp with some bass. Basss response was much better on a set of blutooth headphones that are ""over ear"" but that is to be expected as the larger the driver the more air you move and hence more depth can be reproduced.RangePoor, as a test I was doing some landscaping while listening to music. I placed my Samsung phone on a shelf and started working. At no time did I ever move more than twenty feet from my phone and the connection was intermittent. The headset worked perfectly fine when the phone was physically on me or directly next to me but take a few steps back to where you are six feet away and the connection was intermittent.ComfortVery good, I have never been a fan of in ear headsets. For me they always seem to end up hurting after a few minutes. Not sure what is different on this particular set but they did not produce the discomfort that I normally experience. I will note that the wire holding the two ear pieces together seemed a bit shorter than others I have tested. This may mean that if you have a huge melon that you may find them too small to put on (I was just at the point where they barely fit).ControlsI found them to be too small and not easy to manipulate. They should have been spaced further apart and perhaps seperated so that they were on opposite sides.OverallI'm kinda torn on these. On one hand the sound was very good but the range just flat out stunk. The main reason I am going to give these 4 stars is because they did not hurt as most in ear's do and they do what they are supposed to. If you are working out or jogging and have your phone on your body they have no connection issues and produce a very good quality sound.If you have a question regarding this item, post a comment I usually respond within 24 hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEZ8Q4SHRGBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUMPF1O#wasThisHelpful","RPEZ8Q4SHRGBN","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cool little device for holding your phone, pda or GPS onto your dashboard. It has a two way clip that hooks onto one of your vehicles air conditioning vent slats.You then attach either of the two steel plates on your device. One plate features double sided tape the other is designed to be placed inside your phones case.I was concerned that the mount would slip off when I pulled the phone off but I did not run into any problems in my 5-6 days of playing with it.I am going to use this in my mom's SUV to hold her GPS. She is in her 70's and it is much easier for her to just place the two parts together versus using the stock mount that clips together.I'll update the review if there are any changes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSW8SHG05FPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZBMUK2#wasThisHelpful","R2TSW8SHG05FPQ","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While not able to hold a ton of cards, pictures or money it is definitly a change I like.The Card wallet has a clear plastic area to hold your ID and 3 pockets each capable of holding 1-2 cards. Its super small just barely larger than a credit card and made from a man made leather.Quality of the item is very good and I have to say not having the bulk of my usual wallet is really nice.

"**********************We received a free sample in exchange for an honest review.My wife has a few purses from this seller. Overall she has been very happy with their product. Being that I know very little about the use of such accessories, My professional opinion will be only on the build quality and overall construction of the unit.The bag itself is 10"" wide across the bottom, "" deep and 8"" tall not counting the handles. If you include the handles it is 12.5"" tall.The bag has three compartments the first has a medium sized zippered pouch which can hold most smart phones. It is only about 5"" wide so it may not hold some of the new generation jumbo phones from such makers as Samsung. The opposite opening has two smaller non-zippered pouches which would be great for holding keys or loose change.Both of the two compartments feature a brass zipper. The middle compartment only has a magnetic catch to keep it closed. You should note that all three compartments are lined so it's not like stuff you place in the center one will just end up in the bottom mixed up with stuff from the other two areas.Overall quality of the unit is very good. The stitching is very nicely done all the edges match up well and zippers, snaps and hooks are attached firmly with no visual defects.Personally, speaking as someone who comes from a design background I do think the use of brass is a bit overdone. In the house remodeling field everyone has been trying to eliminate brass fixtures for years. In fact when we bought our home 12 years ago the first thing I did was to rip out all the ugly brass light fixtures, so to see a manufacturer of fashion accessories use such bright brass accents seems a little weird if not slightly outdated.So as I said since I am not the one using it so I needed my wife's input on this item. Here is what she said about it."" Pros: Good quality faux leather, lining and stitching is finished well, rings where shoulder strap attaches to purse are good quality and attached firmly. Good overall size for a dressy handbag, with zippered and magnetic closures. Decorative bow loop seems firmly attached.Cons: Clips that attach shoulder strap to purse seem thin. Exterior zippers are a bit large and bright for a dressy bag. Metallic ends of the decorative bow are plastic, and the finish is rough. Decorative ""bow"" pulls easily and would likely pull out from the loop.For me, a price of $30 would be reasonable for this bag.

"+++++++++++++++++++++++++  I received a free sample of this in exchange for an honest review +++++++++++++++Over the years I have tried a ton of different dashboard and windshield mounts for everything from radar detectors, GPS devices, PDA's and of course for phones. This has a neat twist in that it comes with two metal plates (One round one rectangular) that help affix your item onto the magnetic stand.The stand is essentially the same as others currently on the market. A simple goose-neck mount with a suction cup at the bottom. It does differentiate in that their suction cup comes equipped with an adhesive and the other end has a round rubber coated circle that has a magnet inside to hold your device.As I said earlier the company provides you with two plates. The rectangular one goes inside your battery compartment or under your protective case if you have one. The smaller round disc has an adhesive tape mounted to it which you can secure directly to your item.I have two complaints about this item. And they are more nit-picks than anything else.#1 Why doesn't the rectangular plate come with the double sided adhesive as well?#2 Why only 1 round disc? What if I have more than one device or more than one driver in the household, Or what if you get a new phone? This is one of those cases where it would make sense to charge a dollar or two more for the unit but include 3 of the mounting discs.But as I said that's just me nit-picking. Otherwise this is a very cool device, I am using mine to hold my Passport radar detector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CMY8IXPOSBNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3R9ZKU#wasThisHelpful","R1CMY8IXPOSBNQ","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***************I received a 2pk in exchange for an honest review***********************I really love the look of these mugs they have that antique look to them which is timeless. The mugs are actually made from stainless steel and coated with a copper coating. Quality wise they are a 5 star product but I have to say that they did miss the whole concept behind a ""copper"" mug.The reason to use copper is that it conducts both heat and cold extremely well. In fact if you look around for cookware the best cookware is multi-layered and the very best cookware has solid copper cladding on the bottom. The reason for that is because some materials are terrible at thermal conductivity. What materials suck at conducting heat? well, stainless steel for one. Which once again is why when you see a stainless steel cookware set it is always ""Multi-clad"".So what we have here is a super great looking set that is very durable and sells at a great price BUT has none of the benefits of a true copper mug.Want to read more about copper mugs? I found this site when researching for this review. http://gomoscowmule.com/solid-copper-mugs/Overall I really like the set I am giving it 4 stars because they do look great and they hold up well even when run through the dishwasher.

"*************I received a free set in exchange for an honest review^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^This is a very nice 3 pc set. Comes with a heavy duty pair of black gloves, a 2 ounce injector and a pair of meat claws.Here is a quick look at each item.The gloves. A nice heavy rubber pair that is made from FDA food grade rubber. BPA free and very flexible. I already had a nice set of rubber gloves but these are nice because they are much more flexible than the ones I already owned. Heat dispersion wise they are very effective and I was able to pick up items both from our grill as well as from a toaster oven with no problem what soever.The injector, after I amused myself by torturing all three children by telling them it was time for their annual shots I played with it for awhile. It is surprisingly well made with a shiny chrome finish. It comes complete with two needles one that releases the juice from the sides and one that shoots it out the front.The claws. I'm on the shelf on this. I used them to hold some chicken while I cut it into strips on the grill and they work quite well. However they are molded plastic and I am not sure how well they would handle prolonged exposure to heat. Overall they are pretty cool and for plastic surprisingly sharp.Overall a really nice set all packed in a gift style box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15J30B9M78FOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7K8XHK#wasThisHelpful","R15J30B9M78FOD","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because everyone in the house has allergies lately I have been using the garage vac to get dust and pet hair in the house. With its 50 foot hose I can get everywhere except in the master bedroom and since it's out in the garage there is no worry about getting dust recirculated in the air.I bought the two pack of these and they fit the shop vac as well as our Electrolux canister vac and a Panasonic vac we use in the basement.Overall 2 for under $10 was a good price and I am very happy with the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UW4OMXI19LZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY4F89S#wasThisHelpful","R3UW4OMXI19LZS","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are a large family of six. Wife and I both work and we usually only go to get groceries every 3-4 weeks.We needed a way to keep meats fresh a bit longer and also make them easily accessible so that the kids can help themselves without making a mess. Because we usually buy 2-3 lbs of Ham, roast beef or Turkey (we get them in 1 lb packages) and then freeze everything except 1 lb at a time. The problem is when you thaw you get some runoff juice from the meats and since the plastic deli bags that you buy the meat in leak you end up with a sticky mess in the refrigerator.We bought 4 (2 2-packs) 3 for meats and 1 for cheese. They fit very nicely inside our fridge's drawer and keep the meat fresh.

"+++++++++++++++ I received a free sample of these for reviewing purposes++++++++++++++++++I have now had an opportunity to test several blutooth enabled headsets. My previous set was from Memorex and while they had some great features they had extensive charging problems.I have now been using this pair for over a month and I am very pleased with the performance of them. For years I have had issues with the normal ""in ear"" headphones that come with MP3 media players. They just never seem to fit right and frankly they just seem to always hurt after an extended period of use. The alternative was never that great a huge pair of on ear headsets with a long bulky wire. These fit that niche in between they are on ear headphones that do not completely cover your ear and therefore are not as large and cumbersome as larger sets tend to be. The great thing about larger headphones is of course a larger driver and its niceties include a much better and lower bass response. These headphones clearly did not disappoint when playing back music. The sound was very good with great bass and good highs.I was a bit disappointed with the delay effect produced by the Blutooth signal when playing back movies or watching video. You can see the actors lips move or something like an explosion happen and then hear the resulting sound a second later. Some people might find this distracting it did not bother me too much.Where the delay did bother me was during video game play. I love to play racing games and crashing into something and not hearing the sound for a second was a bit off putting.I am taking one star off for the delay issue even though I do not believe that it is the headsets fault ( I think it's just a side effect of blutooth).Overall I really liked this product of the now 3-4 headsets I have tested this is the best sounding and has the best battery life so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PQUBADC6QBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYP53VY#wasThisHelpful","R7PQUBADC6QBN","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third set of blutooth wireless headphones that I have had the opportunity to test. The other two were much larger versions the last pair was a quite large set of ""over the ear"" type.********************I received a free sample of this in exchange for an unbiased review************************The headphones consist of two triangular shaped plastic pods connected with a thick 1/8"" rubber coated wire. Each pod has buttons so that you can control power, volume etc.. These are considered in ear models and personally I have never found in ear headphones to be wearable for long periods of time (they hurt after a while).I connected these to a Samsung Note Pro 10"" tablet for my review and tested them with 3 seperate sources.First with a game, I played Beach Buggy Blitz which is one of my favorites although I can't seem to get past 48% on it. Sound quality was ok I immediately noted there was a slight delay between what I saw happening on the screen and what I was hearing. As an example I would crash into an object and the sound from the impact took a second to be heard. I will say that this is much less a problem with these headphones than with the previous two I tested. The delay here was under a second and was nowhere near as bad as with the last set.One of the disappointments that I saw with the video game was the bass quality. When the engine revved it sounded tinny and had no bass what so ever. I found that as with many in ear headphones bass response dramatically depended on the placement of each pod inside the ear. In other words if I pushed the rubber earpiece inward it increased the bass but also the discomfort.Secondly I tested several music files. Sound quality was acceptable but nowhere near the performance of the on ear large blutooth models. It really comes down to you will sacrifice some sound quality for the ability to jog, walk etc. and not have to deal with wires or large bulky headsets.Movies. I watched about 15 minutes of a movie on Netflix. While there was a perceivable delay between the actors lip movement on screen and the sound you heard it was very acceptable. Like I said of models I tested these has the least delay issues.Once again with the movie sound was acceptable but not phenomenal. I should point out however that I worked my way through college selling high end audio video and the need for ridiculous sound quality has stuck with me. My wife allows me to have a media room with 13 speakers but she is not a huge fan of watching movies with me and the kids.So how would I break these down?1. Sound quality 3 stars = tolerable if you need a pair of sturdy in ear headphones for sports activity.2. design 3 stars = small, lightweight but I do find them uncomfortable.3. extras 4 stars = they come in a very nice gift box, include extra rubber in ear pieces and a pair of rubber protective sleeves. (I did not understand the purpose of the sleeves, They cover up the outer edges of the headphones also covering the buttons and they fall off REALLY easily so just something stupid that is going to get lost in 3 days.As I said earlier it all comes down to if you have had good experiences with in ear type headphones before and if you have a need for a sporty headset that will stay in place as you are moving about.What is included1. Gift Box2. Headset3. USB cable4. extra rubber things for in ear part5. silly rubber triangle protectors that won't stay on and cover up the buttons6. Manual with ridiculously small printed text.Pairing the headsetVery easy to do. On the right module there are 3 buttons a plus, a minus and a TINY multi-1function button located above the USB connector.Press and hold that button (while the unit is turned off) for 5 seconds you will hear the headphones say ""power om"" keep holding that button until they say ""pairing"".If you have a question regarding this product please post it in m,y comments and I will try to answer within 24 hours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODLJC64D7KYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7DP966#wasThisHelpful","RODLJC64D7KYF","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review started as a 2 stars. But I got a chance to speak with Mike from Lindsay and he walked me through what was most likely going on. He also took care of the two parts that were defective. I immediately noticed a difference when I removed the old hose and plugged in the new one. I knew I was losing suction where the hose was damaged but Mike also pointed out where to check for stuck items.I found my first stuck item where the hose plugs into the unit. The intake there is about 4"" long and has a curve to it. Looks like I sucked up a long piece of wood and it was jammed there. I also seem to have something stuck in the old hose, that one will take me a bit to look at as he recommended using a garden hose to clear it out. For now I just cut the bad section of hose off so I have an extra 35' hoseI really appreciated Lindsay Manufacturing working to straighten things out. it really does make a world of difference. Dealing with an American company versus having to track down someone overseas is priceless to say the least.Original review*******************************************************************************************I bought my unit as I needed something to help keep the garage clean and at the same time do car duty and hit the mudroom which in our house always seems to be full of dirt the kids drag in.The unit arrived and I guess I was a bit let down by the way it was designed. While the unit itself works well it is not built like a normal vacuum cleaner. For example the unit is really not much more than a large metal drum with an inlet and some small holes above where the motor is to let the exhaust air exit the main drum. The bag which is quite large and made from a several ply cloth material is very large (and expensive at over $8 EACH!).So things I did not like about it.1. The lid just sits on the drum, gravity and suction hold it in place.2. The bag doesn't exactly lock in place or anything. There is a small groove cut into the cheap plastic inlet tube that is about 1/16"" deep that the bag ""rests"" in.3. Cost of bags just seems ridiculous at OVER $8 each. They are supposedly 7 gallons but the leads me to the next issue4. The instructions state to ensure that you place the bag in the vac and then expand it to fill the area. However the bag seems to be longer than the space in the barrel so it's conceivable that you may not be able to fill the bag 100% or that the bag could pop off the mounting tube (that has no lock to hold the bag on in any way).5. The hose does not lock in place it's simply a pressure fit into the vac body.6. When you are dealing with 50 feet of hose. It is not convenient to run back and fourth to turn the unit on and off. I let it run continuously as I cleaned our SUV and the motor housing got pretty darn hot.So, I also experienced some quality control issues.1. My hose has a crack in it. I have not called them yet, I'm still debating on whether to keep or return it.2. The small brush attachment is mis-formed. It will go onto the tube but takes some manipulating.I don't know I guess I will give them a call in a few days to see what they want to do about the hose, if they say ship it back I'm just going to return it. For now I have duct tape wrapped around the damaged part and it's alright.Lastly I guess I am also disappointed in the suction power of the unit. I honestly do not believe that it is any better than the suction power on my Fein shop vac that was also $300 (15 years ago) or our Electrolux canister vac which did cost a bit more.The unit does have two huge wins.1. It's very quiet.2. It does not vibrate on the wall at all.Is it worth $320?HECK NO!Personally I would recommend a Fein but I see that the model that replaced mine now uses bags versus mine has a cloth filter and a hepa drum filter. In order to skip the bags it looks like you have to spend $500 with them now.Will update if I return or keep and what their customer service says.UPDATE June 2015Moved from 1 star to 3I contacted Mike from Lindsy Manufacturing. They are replacing the hose and the damaged tool. They were pretty quick to responde which I appreciate, when so many companies do not stand behind their product it's nice to find one that does. Will update again in a few weeks when the parts come in. I am hoping that a hose without a break will fix the low suction power","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VCYJQM65S5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGQGD7E#wasThisHelpful","R9VCYJQM65S5K","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample of this product in exchange for a fair product review.We have a Great Pyrenees, she is a wonderful dog, great with the kids, super friendly and for the most part low maintenance. Well, except for the hair. The hair, well it ends up everywhere! On the furniture, on the floor, under appliances and furniture just everywhere!Brushing is a way of life for us and I have tried many different brushes. What I like about this set is that the spikes are long and hold a fair amount of hair. I recently purchased a brush that had shorter sdpikes and found that it just did not get deep enough into her coat to dig out the loose hair that was underneath. The metal spikes on the brush are about 3/4"" long, just perfect for our application.I also liked the Dematting tool. it's perfect for when the dog gets small tangles in her coat, with our dog that is usually in her tail where the fur gets all tangled together and becomes very difficult to comb. The Dematting tool allows you to get through that with little effort.I am giving this item 5 stars, I generally try to not do 5 star ratings but I really liked the quality of the tools. They feature a very nice thick (easy to hold) rubberized handle. The components all appear to be high quality and I liked the chrome trim ring around the tool handles.If you have questions about this product please feel free to leave a comment and I will responde within 24 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BG4AP6P9DB13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI2GM36#wasThisHelpful","R2BG4AP6P9DB13","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item for free in exchange for a review.I find it difficult to rate cables as wen I was younger and sold high end AV equipment, I would push high end cable brands such as Monster Cable, Esoteric Audio and other ridiculously priced inter-connects.As I get older I tend to think that a ""cable is a cable"" and that as long as the connectors are on nice and tight your going to get a good signal transfer.This particular cable is marketed as a Sony replacement, the truth however is that it is merely a micro USB cable that will work with pretty much anything out there. In fact I gave this to my wife to use next to her side of the bed to charge her Samsung S4 phone.As far as quality goes it seems to be a well made product the connectors are on nice and tight. The plastic sheathing on the cable is glossy and I would prefer a matte rubber finish but all in all that is just personal preference and nothing more.I have had other cables that were wrapped in cloth those look nicer but of course are more expensive here you are paying for the longer length in this case 10 feet which is great for when you need to be a bit farther away from your main unit or charger.I am giving the cable 5 stars as it performs as expected and appears to be a good value.

"I have young kids and they love to watch TV shows such as Octonauts and other Disney channel favorites. I had a simple goal, I wanted to let them watch Comcast TV, either in the family room or in the kitchen without having to turn my Denon receiver and all its sub components on.So I hook up my cable box to the input, the first output goes to my receiver which is normally where my cable box would be plugged into. The second output goes to a Toshiba 32"" hanging in the kitchen and the third to my Sharp 52"" in the family room.So video signal seems to work fine at all 3 outputs. However, Sound to the receiver (output 1) works fine, sound to the kitchen tv works about 50% of the time and sound to the family room well, 0 percent of the time unless I physically unplug the unit.So I guess I am just SOL, waste of time and money and I can't even do what I set out to do!","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TR4F5R5L903O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JK7BW4#wasThisHelpful","R2TR4F5R5L903O","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a quick way to get more light in my unfinished basement.

"I got a deal on two of these $50 plus shipping so I could not pass it up.These can be installed directly into a cutout in your drywall but if you do you are pretty much asking for trouble. Sony offers the backbox for these but its ridiculously expensive and really needs to be installed before drywall is put up.My solution was to make a much smaller box that measures 1 cubic foot internally. I packed it with fiber-fill and installed it in a corner of my family room. Unfortunately if you don't have experience in doing drywall repairs I do not recommend fooling around with in wall speakers.Bass response is actually pretty good and paired to set of JBL in ceiling speakers they rock. The important thing to remember is that sound is created by moving air. These come with 8"" drivers and if your main speakers have components larger than 8"" these probably won't do much to boost your sound experience. But for me going from a pair of speakers that have 6"" wooofers adding two subs makes all the difference in the world.Once again don't waste your time if you're not going to build or put it in a bockbox. you're just going to be disappointed and end up with two huge holes in your walls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YCZ388SX1ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OUEB22#wasThisHelpful","R21YCZ388SX1ZE","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Illuminating a flag has always been a problem. You had limited choices, either you went low voltage and used a transformer and spotlight or you hired an electrician to run you a 110v light out near the pole. Either way the cost to do those two options would often place it out of reach for most folks.Now for under $40 you can get a simple solution that is automatic and requires no interaction on your part. The unit is 8.5"" round 1.5"" thick and features 20 white (5000k, bright white not yellow) LEDs.The unit comes with the rechargeable batteries included and takes approximately 8 hours of light to fully charge the three batteries.The unit has a light sensor located on the top of it which automatically turns the lights on and runs them until the battery is dead which seemed to be about 4-7 hours depending on how much direct sunlight the solar panels get throughout the day. (I tested it for 4 days, two of those days had minimal sunlight and were overcast).Overall the unit is well made and seems durable. However, I do question the long term durability of any of these products as the top is flat and will retain snow and rain. Secondly where the panels meet the plastic trim, the panels are slightly recessed allowing water to seep into the unit (tested), it then sits inside the unit and there are no drainage holes on the bottom to prevent excess water from building up within the case. Lastly I noticed that the battery compartments do not have any sort of weatherstripping which will eventually lead to battery corrosion.I am giving the product 4 stars. Mainly because it is a really cool device and it fills a very specific niche. However, I must say that I do not see this (or any of the similar products available here on Amazon) lasting more than two years before the wiring shorts out or rusts due to water getting into the unit.I received a free sample of this product from the manufacturer for the sole purpose of writing a review. If you have a question about this product please feel free to post a question, I generally will respond within 24 hours.I personally would recommend picking up a piece of plexiglass at the hardware store drilling a hole in the middle of it and mounting it on top of the unit to shield the light from direct rain. This should extend the life considerably.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDVBWGE7SGG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9X1FU4#wasThisHelpful","RCDVBWGE7SGG4","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received two samples of the products. One with 2 glasses and 9 soap-stones and one with 4 glasses for review purposes.I had been wanting to purchase some of the stones for about a year now and this opportunity to test them out is definitely pretty cool.The product came in a nice gift box that measures 11 inches wide 5 inches deep and is 4 inches tall. Inside protected by foam inserts are the two double wall glasses a small felt pouch to hold your soap-stones and the 9 rocks wrapped in plastic.The two glasses hold a little over 1 cup with 3-4 stones in them and almost a cup and a half without the stones.The stones themselves measure 3/4"" square and I was a bit surprised to see that they had a rough texture to them, (I expected or imagined they would be perfectly smooth).As for testing I am not a liquor person so I basically stuck the glasses in the freezer splitting the stones between the two and used them for beer. Overall it was a positive experience the kids were fascinated by the stones and desperately wanted them their drinks so the next day it was their turn and they loved them.As a side note, the stones are not 100% non porous. When I placed them in the kids grape juice they did pick up a hint of purple, It did however wash away (mostly) after a couple of rinses.Overall the quality of the set is outstanding, the glasses are very cool, the stones are nice the gift box was surprisingly sturdy. I would not hesitate to give this to someone as a gift.If you have a question regarding this set, please feel free to post a comment.

For that I sought out my nieces. With several High School girls having the opportunity to wear and give feedback I was very comfortable giving those products high marks.

The true color is a much prettier deep blue which is almost a deep purple. The earrings are just shy of 1/2"" round with that blue stone measuring a whopping 1/4"" in diameter. Each earring is covered in white gold which in turn is encrusted with many tiny white stones. All in all a very stunning piece of jewelry. As stated earlier I know that this companies products hold up well. The pieces that the girls got last year are still worn and look great.The girls absolutely loved this style and at only $19.99 they seem like a very reasonable priced set for such high quality items. Please take a moment to look at the short 30 second video, hopefully you will find them as appealing as my Nieces do.About me.I am very selective about the products I review.

I was able to just get a sim card from my local T-mobile store and had this going within a minute.Overall she is happy with it, I feel better knowing she can call if something goes wrong and since she doesn't need data it is only costing me $10 a month, like the commercial says ""priceless!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TEK9IS87WXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORC1WWM#wasThisHelpful","R18TEK9IS87WXI","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 3 boys are Nerf Nuts! I often got caught in the crossfire. I feel that the manual guns are a bit too clunky so I bought one of these. Since then we have ordered 3 more.There is a lot to like about this gun, for me the main thing is ease of use. The gun is very lightweight, even when compared to some smaller manual nerf products the gun seems lighter. My youngest is 4 years old and what is great about this is that I can load up a clip for him and he can handle it because the trigger is easy enough for him to pull and the gun is light enough for him to handle. (Some guns such as the Nerf Demolisher have a trigger that is difficult to depress, not to mention they are much heavier)There are a lot of folks who write reviews on these toys who complain about jams. let's be clear this is a toy, meant for kids not a precision made weapon. The darts are made from foam and soft rubber and wear out relatively quickly. In my experience you end up buying more darts not necessarily because they get worn out but because the kids lose them in the yard or the dog eats them.My 13 yo has modified several of these, With the mod you can open the top hatch while holding the trigger, this simplifies unclogging jams. If your kid is 12+ modifications are surprisingly easy and videos are readily available by searching by the guns model name on youtube.What I most like about this gun is its ability to handle different sized clips such as the 10 or 18. I would honestly recommend getting this gun and 2, 18 capacity clips over spending let's say $40 on a more expensive gun. The clips and added ammo adds to the guns fun factor.Here are some tips to prevent some problems.1. Teach your child to aim and then fire versus just unloading the full clip. This eliminates 3 problems.First this increases game play time and makes battles more fun. Sure it's cool to blast off 18 darts in a few seconds but then the gameplay has to stop while you reload.  Secondly remember the darts are made from foam and rubber and sometimes firing too quickly is what causes the jam. And lastly, This gun works by shoving the dart into the path of two spinning wheels. If you fire too quickly those flywheels lose speed in between shots, all of which in turn means the darts don't fly as far and tend not to fly as ""straight"" as they normally would.  In short aim, shoot wait a second then repeat.2. Don't over-jam your clips. Even though we use 18 capacity clips we rarely place 18 of the darts into the clip. The second biggest cause of jams is darts getting crushed and not popping up into the firing mechanism correctly. By not overloading clips you eliminate some of the pressure that distorts and ages the darts.  (my kids immediately tried to overload the clips)3. Use high quality batteries. While we normally buy the cheap Kirkland brand (Costco) AA batteries, this does considerably better if you use a high performance battery. Energizer or Duracell work the best. In fact Nerf recommends Duracell batteries. If your kids are older then you may want to invest into the higher quality AA's designed for high demand products such as cameras. They are definitely more expensive but they shoot darts farther and harder.As a family we have about 12 Nerf guns, this model is my overall favorite. Relatively small. lightweight, you don't have to cock it or anything, just load up a clip, pop it in there and have some fun!Lastly, by someone who has been shot in the eye with one of these darts. IT HURTS!Pick up some cheap safety glasses and make sure your kid wears them when they are playing!I've got some links for you here and as always if you have a question, post it I usually respond within 24 hours!N-Strike Elite 18-Dart Quick Reload Clip  (get 2)Nerf N-Strike Elite Dart Refill Pack (75 Darts)Nerf Zombie Strike Dart Refill PackDuracell Ultra Power Aa Batteries 16 CountDuracell Procell AA 24 Pack PC1500BKD09","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PC220RW07VA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMJS1TW#wasThisHelpful","R2PC220RW07VA0","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our dog really loves these but she destroys them within minutes. I buy 2 packs of these per month. I usually just drop one on the floor for her and she is in heaven for about an hour. She will throw these up in the air and then run after it or she will bring it to me to throw.I sometimes come across the rubber innards of the balls and what worries me is you don't find the remnants of the outer shell or covering. makes me worry she is eating that part.Gave it two stars because they are great for playing fetch with.

They are of course stainless steel and they have nice rounded handles.The badI hate being the guy who doesn't rubber stamp these as a 5 star item. But I try to look at the product in a realistic manner and I do actually use the tools several times before writing the review. My main concern with these tools is the size. Every tool is 1/3 shorter than any other grilling tool I have used before. You may ask yourself  “So what?”  but here is the thing. We have a Weber Genesis gas grill, middle of the road model not the ridiculously huge ones but a nice grill. WE started by putting 9 burgers on the grill and then using the spatula to flip them. The problem is because the tool is so ridiculously short when you are flipping burgers that are towards the back of the grill your arm is frickin on fire! The whole purpose of a grill tool is so that you can safely grill without the discomfort of burning yourself.So lets compare these tools to the cheap set I picked up at Target about 10 years ago.Spatula RRP: $12.99:      http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYL53ZCOverall 14.5” long including the ring for hangingHandle is 4 3/8” longspatula part is 3” wide by 3 1/2” long (not square (tapered) so it's actually smaller than that.Compare to my old oneOverall 21” long including the ring for hangingHandle is 8 1/2” longspatula part is 3” wide by 4 1/2” long (not tapered) a perfect rectangle.Overall comparisonWhen using the Firewolf brand tool you immediately notice that the tool has a considerable amount of flex. This is because of the thin steel used when compared to my older set that uses steel twice as thick and has almost no flex to it when you apply pressure.  Overall 2 stars for first being too short to use and for having too small a flipping surface.---------------------------------------------------------Tongs RRP: $12.99:        http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYLHF9EOverall 13 1/2” longHandle is 4 3/8” longThe end part (not sure what to call it) The grabby part?

You can easily bend the metal simply by using two fingers to pull the metal in different directions. This product on its own would be a 1 star item.Fork RRP: $12.99:          http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYLDDD6Overall 14” long including the hoop for hangingHandle is 4 3/8” longFork itself is 1 1/4” wide by about 3 1/2” longCompare to my old oneOverall 20 1/4” longHandle is 8 3/4” longThe fork itself 1” by 4 1/4” longOverall comparisonSame issues, metal is too thin, not long enough, can be flexed very easily. I also was not a fan of the flared fork on the tool. The two forks are not straight pieces of metal instead they are angled, I tend to believe that the straight ones piece meat more easily and cut into it much less than the angular shape of the Firewolf unit does.Grill Brush RRP: $12.99:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYKUG8COverall 12” long not including the string for hangingHandle is 6” long  plastic not stainless like the other toolsBrush width is 6” wideCompare to my old oneOverall 22” longHandle is 9 1/2” longBrush width is 6” wideOverall comparisonBesides the length of the tool the two were almost identical. The twisted wire that makes up the frame was about 25% thinner than on my old set but that made no perceivable impact on its cleaning ability. This all comes down to whether you are a hot or cold cleaner.  I tend to scrub the grates and then turn the grill on. However my wife prefers to let the grill run for a few minutes and then scrub the grates while they are hot. For me the Firewolf scrubber worked just fine but my wife prefers the older one with the longer handle.So, What's the deal?Overall what it comes down to is if you live in an apartment and have a small grill on the patio or balcony these would probably be great for you.

We have a Weber Genesis gas grill, middle of the road model not the ridiculously huge ones but a nice grill. WE started by putting 9 burgers on the grill and then using the spatula to flip them. The problem is because the tool is so ridiculously short when you are flipping burgers that are towards the back of the grill your arm is frickin on fire! The whole purpose of a grill tool is so that you can safely grill without the discomfort of burning yourself.So lets compare these tools to the cheap set I picked up at Target about 10 years ago.Spatula RRP: $12.99:      http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYL53ZCOverall 14.5” long including the ring for hangingHandle is 4 3/8” longspatula part is 3” wide by 3 1/2” long (not square (tapered) so it's actually smaller than that.Compare to my old oneOverall 21” long including the ring for hangingHandle is 8 1/2” longspatula part is 3” wide by 4 1/2” long (not tapered) a perfect rectangle.Overall comparisonWhen using the Firewolf brand tool you immediately notice that the tool has a considerable amount of flex. This is because of the thin steel used when compared to my older set that uses steel twice as thick and has almost no flex to it when you apply pressure.  Overall 2 stars for first being too short to use and for having too small a flipping surface.---------------------------------------------------------Tongs RRP: $12.99:        http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYLHF9EOverall 13 1/2” longHandle is 4 3/8” longThe end part (not sure what to call it) The grabby part? Is 1 3/4” square also taperedCompare to my old oneOverall 18 3/4” longHandle is 8 3/4” longThe end part (not sure what to call it) The grabby part? Is 2” by 3 1/2” (with one rounded side)Overall comparisonThis is where I thought the Firewolf brand did the worst very thin steel causes a LOT of flex making it difficult to pick up larger pieces of meat. You can easily bend the metal simply by using two fingers to pull the metal in different directions. This product on its own would be a 1 star item.Fork RRP: $12.99:          http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYLDDD6Overall 14” long including the hoop for hangingHandle is 4 3/8” longFork itself is 1 1/4” wide by about 3 1/2” longCompare to my old oneOverall 20 1/4” longHandle is 8 3/4” longThe fork itself 1” by 4 1/4” longOverall comparisonSame issues, metal is too thin, not long enough, can be flexed very easily. I also was not a fan of the flared fork on the tool. The two forks are not straight pieces of metal instead they are angled, I tend to believe that the straight ones piece meat more easily and cut into it much less than the angular shape of the Firewolf unit does.Grill Brush RRP: $12.99:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYKUG8COverall 12” long not including the string for hangingHandle is 6” long  plastic not stainless like the other toolsBrush width is 6” wideCompare to my old oneOverall 22” longHandle is 9 1/2” longBrush width is 6” wideOverall comparisonBesides the length of the tool the two were almost identical. The twisted wire that makes up the frame was about 25% thinner than on my old set but that made no perceivable impact on its cleaning ability. This all comes down to whether you are a hot or cold cleaner.  I tend to scrub the grates and then turn the grill on. However my wife prefers to let the grill run for a few minutes and then scrub the grates while they are hot. For me the Firewolf scrubber worked just fine but my wife prefers the older one with the longer handle.So, What's the deal?Overall what it comes down to is if you live in an apartment and have a small grill on the patio or balcony these would probably be great for you. However if you are a serious grill-er then I honestly can't recommend them.Just for fun I browsed Amazon for grilling tools. Assuming I wanted to spend $40 (the combined price of these 4 tools) here is what I found.Mr. Bar-B-Q 18-Piece Stainless-Steel Grill Tool Set sells for $38.37. Almost identical to the set that I have which is over 10 years old. 18 pcs plus a nice case.How about something more similar to this?Cuisinart CGS-5014 14-Piece Deluxe Stainless-Steel Grill Set $27.69 all stainless steel and comes with a case.So overallquality = 2 starsdurability = 1 star (due to the thin steel and amount of flex in tools)value = 1 star (compared to other sets on Amazon)safety during use = 1 star short tool length makes it uncomfortable to use over the grill With that I can not recommend this set.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFEHD2ZY86L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYL53ZC#wasThisHelpful","R2SFEHD2ZY86L8","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about this product. First off I want to point out that anyone who has a review for this item yet does not show a ""Verified Purchase"" next to their review, received one of these for free in exchange for a review. I believe in being up front and honest about that and wish others did the same.So once again, I received a free unit in exchange for writing a fair and balanced review.This is the nicest shoe horn I have ever seen. It is very well made, has some heft to it and the features such as the expandable extension handle is pretty cool. Having said all that though it falls a bit short of meeting expectations and I have three complaints about this product.The Shoe Horn features a flexible section in between the horn itself and the handle. If you are older and just need an additional hand getting your shoe on it works great. However, If you need a hand getting those long stubborn boots on and need to apply some backwards pressure to squeeze into the boot then that cool spring feature actually works against you and makes the job much harder than it should be.My second complaint with this unit is the size of the horn itself. it really needed to be longer to accommodate taller shoes and boots. I think they fell short by making the handle so long yet skimping on the most important part.Lastly the expandable handle is neat but felt flimsy, the thin walled tubing gave the impression it would eventually fail especially if force is used. Which may in fact explain why the spring was used. By adding the spring you can't exert pressure and thus bending the expandable handle.  I also did not like that you can't push down with this when the handle is extended as that only causes the tubing to collapse into its not expanded stageSo What's the breakdown?Cool factor = 5 starsOverall features = 4 starsDurability = 2 starsusefulness = 2 stars (due to not being able to apply any backwards pressure)Overall 3 starsSo if you just need a light duty unit and the long handle will make it easier for you this is a nice unit. However if you need a heavy duty unit and you have bent or broken cheap units, this probably is not for you. 3 stars = meets expectations1 or 2 stars = fails to meet expectations4 or 5 = exceeds expectations","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37OPPO566LOYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNJ6V4A#wasThisHelpful","R37OPPO566LOYI","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off these are very small. Its a thin rubber toy made from very thin plastic/ rubber type product. It is built from two pieces the head and the body. Unfortunately my dog destroyed all 4 I bought within seconds.I have some other concerns regarding this product including the fact that it is a drop ship from China. Being that is is sold directly from a Chinese supplier and mailed to your home in 3 weeks there is no one who does a quality inspection nor verifies that this product is even made from materials suitable for ingestion from a pet.Having worked in a corporate retail environment for several years I know that retailers test products before committing to purchase them and generally do a good job of eliminating products not worthy of reaching the consumers.I gave this product two stars because of its ridiculously small size and very poor quality. I would expect a chew toy to last more than two minutes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6KAXFYQ5S0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEW1YT2#wasThisHelpful","R2O6KAXFYQ5S0U","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off I believe in full disclosure and complete honesty when writing reviews, something I wish everyone on Amazon took a bit more seriously.I have a simple rating system.3 stars = Meets expectations4 or 5 stars = exceeds expectations1 or 2 stars fails to meet basic expectations (needs more development or better quality control)I received this product as a “reviewer sample” so it was given to me for the sole purpose of writing a review.  I will start by saying I have very mixed feelings about this product. I guess I was not sure what to expect besides a case with a built in battery and external wireless charger.The system is comprised of the following components. A. 2 piece plastic case. The back rests on the phone and then is held in place by a trim ring that goes around the outer edge of the phone.B. Battery holder/ extender  (features an extra battery built in)C. Wireless charging padD. Micro USB charging cablePhone InstallationPretty simple installation process. Use your fingernail to pry off the back of your phone. Remove the OEM battery and install it into the aftermarket battery/ holder.  Install the battery holder into the battery socket. I found this slightly difficult as mine required a small amount of  “cramming” to get it in place.The case is two parts separate them, then lay  your phone into the back of the case (there are two tabs that click into the phone itself.  Then snap the trim ring on (from the front) to hold the case together.First Impressions.Overall this is a very good concept. A hard shell protective case, a battery booster and a wireless charging system. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in the case quality.  It reminds me of the cheap stuff you would buy from one of those mall kiosks. My issue with this type of product is it truly offers only minimum protection when you drop your phone.Lets look at the componentsBattery boosterThis is one of the products strongest points. Simply it doubles your battery life. (Usually I have to put my phone on the charger somewhere along the day in order to get a full days use out of the phone).  By piggy backing an extra battery you are able to get more done and not worry about running out of power.External Wireless charger.Nice simple unit made from aluminum and about the same size as your phone. Has protective rubber feet to sit on your desk and plugs into your external charger via a micro USB cable (cable is supplied). (Requires an external charger, not supplied)CaseUnfortunately for me, this is what I least liked about the product. Phones are not cheap and if you expect your phone to last you more than a year a high quality case is a necessity. I always choose a 2 part case that feature a hard plastic shell along with a soft rubber liner that attaches to the outside of the plastic. A combination of plastic and rubber ensures that if the phone falls it will be protected and most importantly the rubber surround will prevent the phone or case from popping open and ejecting your phone when it hits the ground.I used the case and battery extender on my phone for 2 days and then had my wife use it on her S4 for three days here is what she said about the case ”I feel nervous because the case is slippery and when I push a button it creaks and the edges pop open”.On 8-31 My son dropped my wife's phone and what I expected to happen actually occurred. The phone hit the ground the case popped open and there lay 4 pieces on the kitchen floor.And that, is the issue!The case is the “glue or binder” that makes the package work or not work! Each of us makes a decision as to what level of protection our phones need.  I know that in my active life I need to know that when I drop my phone it's not going to break. So if the case sucks, Where does that leave us? Can you use the battery and charger without the case? NOPE! Can you at least use the battery? NOPE! Can you use the wireless charging? NOPE! So your options are very limited.A. You deal with a low quality, low protection case to get some extra battery life and wireless charging.B. You go without and protect your phone with decent case..You of course will have to make your own decision. Personally for me the case is not going to work with my job and what my phone goes through. My wife on the other hand is much more careful with her phone and she is thrilled with the extended battery life.The breakdownSo where does that leave us?Cool factor 5 starsBattery boost 5 starsCase quality 1 starcase performance 1 starProduct usefulness without case 0 starsOverall I have to say 3 stars. A super cool concept that falls short only because of the case.In all fairness If you are one of the folks who buy those decorative snap on cases, you may find the protection adequate. What I look for in a case is protection not aesthetics.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D495H9KFT34T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCL7XNI#wasThisHelpful","R1D495H9KFT34T","A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DLK8Q3Z5FOY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Joanna Hoggs and I feel she doesn't make enough movies.  When I found out she was directing Exhibition I was already in line for my ticket.  But I found this movie to be ok at best.  It's about a couple living in a house of very contemporary design.  Something you might expect a young, artsy couple to live in rather than an older couple like these two.  The husband thinks it's time to move from the house while the wife is rather attached to it... VERY attached.  She literally has an erotic relationship with it.  Often using the house and it's furniture to get herself off.  When the husband tries to engage with her sexually she often isn't interested....but she does get turned on by the house.Strangely enough she's also somewhat afraid of the house whenever she has to spend too much time alone in it... and she is also apparently afraid of leaving the house late at night.  There is an implication that something bad happened to them either inside or right outside the house at one point in the past, but we never figure out what that bad thing might have been.There is one scene where we see her having sex with her husband, but the way she's rubbing up on the couch makes it seem like a threesome.  Slowly we see her start to move closer to her husband and being able to let go of the house.  It's an interesting movie, but we are left with too many questions.  I'm ok with unknowns in film, but feel that there is a line where if there are too many of them, you cease to care about the story and the characters.  And I think there are just too many questions with this film and it leaves us not caring as much as we should have.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVD9UFAVQL86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5ND2IQ#wasThisHelpful","ROVD9UFAVQL86","A3M17XG8HL7JRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M17XG8HL7JRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know what kind of warped minds wrote this episode about a woman's beauty being the cause of her being raped.  Then the ""cure"" for her not having to worry about rapists anymore is some potion that makes her look ugly.  I can't imagine many women were on that writing team, but one thing's for sure-  Those people didn't do an ounce of research on rape or rapists before writing that episode.Not only did it not make any sense (If this Wessen can't be in any intimate relationship then how the hell do they procreate? and how the hell did the mother and grandmother go through an entire sexual attack BEFORE killing the guys when this Wessen only has to feel defensive to release the toxin that instantly kills?)  But all of the characters imply that it is the female that is encouraging rape by the way she looks.  Also the episode claims that a man simply has to get aroused to stimulate the toxin in the Wessen-  Rape isn't really about arousal, but about power and in fact it's not so uncommon for rapists to not be able to get aroused for some time and they have been known hold their victims until they can find a way to become aroused. (Average rape lasts 6 hrs).  Furthermore Rapists are more likely to target victims that have a more insecure attitude (in other words seem easier targets) than they are likely to attack victims based on their looks.  Despite these facts everyone implies that the girl is the issue because she's the one that's beautiful and if you can just ""fix"" her beauty it won't be a problem anymore.  And indeed in the end her beauty is removed which results in her happiness & all is well! This was a truly offensive and sick episode and I can't believe they actually aired this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC3DPU7FI2PKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAR7QHC#wasThisHelpful","RC3DPU7FI2PKL","A3M17XG8HL7JRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M17XG8HL7JRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Bobcat Goldthwait does a great job as the fired and disgruntled employee.  Bill Murray is really over the top in this movie and sometimes it's funny, but other times it's just too much.

"Mehh...  I don't find Bill Murray's character in this movie to be very likable.  In fact I find him really annoying.  Once they enter into the army nothing remotely realistic happens in this movie.  Every single female character is there for only one purpose- to be a sexual object.  Even the female soldiers wear uniforms that were way too tight for regulation.  The cast has a lot of great supporting comedians in it, but we don't get to see most of them much so they're wasted in the film.

It's better to mix the card up by gently placing cards in different spots which is kinda time consuming.  But at least the cards are firm enough that they don't bend easily.As others have noted it does not come with a custom box for the cards so traveling with them I have to use a rubber band.

"The first 2 weeks of use I loved this mat... but then I started to need a second mat to put on top of it.  Many of the excercises I'm doing require that I stand on my knees and this mat provided great support... but after only a few days the imprint of my knees would stay on there longer and longer to the point where 24 hours later my knee prints are still there.  Of coarse I move my knees around to different spots, but now my mat is full of knee prints.  The mat gets thinner at these points and now my knee starts to hurt while I'm on the mat.  I have to put an EXTRA mat on top of this one just so that it doesn't hurt now.  I'm going to have to look for something sturdier that keeps it's thickness.  In the meantime I've actually cut off the last 14"" of the mat and use it to add extra cushioning for my knees while I'm using the mat.  I'm short so I don't need the full length anyway.I do think that this mat is great for yoga too and have had no problems doing so.  However it's not good for a serious yoga practice because it's too thick and stretchy.

"I like the product.  It warms quickly.  I don't like where the cord plugs in.  It plugs into the side but into the very middle of the blanket on that side.  So it's very awkward as you're likely to carry the cord with you whenever you move the blanket.  It would be better to have the cord close to one of the corners instead of in the middle.  My previous blanket had it on the corner and that was definitely better.  The size is good.  I could've even gone with something a little smaller.  But it seems that with electric blankets size is limited to either full blanket size or tiny spa wrap size without much in between.  The size is smaller than a blanket which I like though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381BUZF7UKC3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BF2OAK#wasThisHelpful","R381BUZF7UKC3Y","A3M17XG8HL7JRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M17XG8HL7JRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The show has gotten into soap opera territory this season.  Split personalities? Government mind control? Secret Ancient Plagues hidden by ancient Davinci code-like monks?  Are you kidding me?  And it's hilarious how the agents quickly accept these ridiculous soap opera explanations without so much as a blink.Berlin came and went as if he barely mattered when he was hyped up into this super mysterious guy the first season.  Reddington's ex loses a finger and a tooth and she barely mentions it as if it doesn't bother her that she's lost parts of her body due to Reddington.  The show is all over the place.  When Keen ends the first episode does her last scene by sporting a new sexy haircut and a low cut shirt to symbolize her ""growth"" as an agent our eyes rolled as it was too obvious and cheesy.  The story lines aren't as simple and clear as they were in season 1.  Did they change the writers this season?  Did they hire a bunch of new ones?  Or did they get so pumped up with the popularity of the first season that they became over-ambitious?

"I love this dvd.  It's somehow both really easy.... and yet really hard.  Making it great for non-fit and fit people alike.It's easy in the sense that it's easy to follow.  Tracy goes into detail on how to do the moves precisely and she doesn't go too fast (except in the ab section which I'll get to later).  If you're just starting out you can just do the workouts without weights or pick and choose from the 4 sections to move more slowly.If you are very fit you will still get your butt kicked though as she will recommend you use weights and you can do more than one section at a time.  My butt and lower back muscles have always been weak so the butt section is something I could not go move through all the way even without weights.  Only after 2 1/2 weeks of doing the butt section every single day was I FINALLY able to move through that 15 minute workout all the way through (although I still get out of breath by the end of it).  You really get to appreciate just how friggin' strong this petite little woman is watching her do all these moves without breaking a sweat AND while using 1.5 lb weights on her ankles!The ab section moves really fast.  She warns you of this when she starts this section.  I'm guessing she was running out of time on the DVD or something so she tried to cram the Ab section in there by moving super fast.  I have the VLC player on my computer and I am able to slow the playback down a couple of notches so that I can learn the moves.  Eventually I'll be able to do it full speed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TVN7520TWX41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLX76GY#wasThisHelpful","R1TVN7520TWX41","A3M17XG8HL7JRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M17XG8HL7JRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is probably best for an already practicing Hindu or scholar.  Not easy for a beginner or non hindu to grasp I think as there's not enough detail.  I had looked up various morning hindu prayers in the past and was surprised to not find them in this book.  For example, the one where one looks at the hand upon wakening does not seem to be in this book.  Instead there are other prayers to the grahas etc.  I thought the Gayatri Mantra was supposed to be recited at sunrise each morning, but the book doesn't mention when to recite it. (though of coarse the mantra is in there).  I think based on the time schedule mentioned in the beginning of the book it should actually be recited before sunrise.  I wish there was more detail on when the mantras and prayers are to be recited.  It also doesn't really mention any nightly rituals prayers before bed which I guess is ok since it is about the ""Daily"" practice of hindus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUS8X3KRAL3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8121505380#wasThisHelpful","R1LUS8X3KRAL3M","A3M17XG8HL7JRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M17XG8HL7JRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received three 100% cotton lint free cloths that are 28 inches by 29 inches. These are perfect to use as kitchen towels or for cleaning. They are thin but absorbent for drying dishes and are larger than standard kitchen towels. For cleaning, they are lint free and can be used for wiping down counters and appliances, washing windows and dusting. They're also machine washable and come out looking new to be used again.These are made in China. The material is sewn well at the hem and it appears to be nice cloth that I'll get a lot of use out of. I tend to go through paper towels quickly, and using these is more of a cost-effective option.

"Hip & Joint Max soft chews are dark, rich, and have a strong smell of bacon. Each chew is about 3/4 inch in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick. Since they're soft, they can easily be torn in halves and quarters. The jar has a dosage chart based on weight and contains 30 ""treats."" The active ingredients are Glucosamine, Chondroitin Sulfate, MSM, Vitamin C, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Yucca Schidigera Powder, & Hyaluronic Acid.The advantage of these is they're easier to give your dog in comparison to mixing powder in food or giving the liquid Glucosamine orally with a syringe. If your dog likes them, it's a stress-free way of giving them these supplements. I placed my tongue on one, and they are bacon flavored. If I could change anything, I wish the level of Glucosamine was higher. Usually for dogs under 25 or 30 lbs. they take about 500 mg. a day. This has 225 mg. per 2 chews. So, that would be about 4 a day. The jar comes with 30 in it.I like how this has a combination of ingredients known to help dogs with arthritis. It's made in the USA and appears to be a quality product with a lot and expiration date. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty dog treat with joint support supplements.

" 1:35 Mins This is a self-balancing two-wheel electric scooter. In the owner’s manual, it’s referred to as a “Dreamwalker.” You ride it like a skateboard, except it’s electronic and goes up to 10 miles an hour. I think it requires more coordination and practice than a skateboard. A skateboard has four wheels, this only has two. What they have in common is the motions to control the board are similar. To speed up lean forward. To slow down, lean backward. To turn right, slightly till your left foot forward. To turn left, slightly tilt your right foot forward.It’s made of a sleek, black, thick shiny plastic and the board is about 23 inches long by 7-1/2 inches wide. It is one piece, but the two halves can twist and turn independently. The two wheels are each about 7 inches in diameter, have good tread, and fancy “hubcaps.” On the surface of the transporter, it also has thick foot pads with plenty of traction. It’s fairly heavy at about 30 lbs. – I am an adult woman weighing about 115 lbs., I could comfortably carry it a short distance. However, if rode farther from home and the battery ran out, it would be a bear to try and carry back. As an accessory for electric scooters, they should design a strap that fits around the middle portion so it can be rolled home. The wheels will roll manually even when the power is off. The charge on the battery lasts about five hours. The battery light in the middle will also turn to red once you’re down to 10% battery. When you get this it needs to be charged for 1-2 hours and comes with the power cord and battery charger. This is my first time trying out one of these and am having fun with it. I was a little scared at first. I still haven’t completely mastered it. The thing about me is I lack in coordination. I’m also very sedentary. I go to work and sit at a computer. I come home and sit at a computer. I don’t exercise. This has been going on for years. So, using this scooter is way out of my normal comfort zone. Now that I have a bit more experience, it’s not as intimidating. If I run into a chair it will stop – not a big deal. I’ve been practicing mainly inside, balancing myself by holding onto a chair, the wall, a door, etc. I can feel it in my calves and abdomen, this is good exercise. I think this is a great workout and I enjoy it. I’m working myself up and once I improve, I plan to start riding outside more. While smooth surfaces are best, you can also ride it in the grass and dirt. I would recommend this scooter for anyone needing to take short regular trips or get more exercise.

"This is a 3.5-ounce glass bottle of extra virgin olive oil with black truffle. The ingredients are extra virgin olive oil, black truffle (tuber aestivum) aroma.

"This is a stainless steel mug or thermos. It measures 8 inches tall by 2.75 inches in diameter and has a screw off cap. There are many similarities between this mug and the one it replaced. The one I had before was different from just any run-of-the-mill coffee mug. It was made out of porcelain but had the exact same style as this one. I would take it everywhere. Two weeks ago I was packing stuff in my car and forgot I left it on top. I drove off and when I turned the corner it flew off and shattered into pieces. I've been looking for something I would love as much, and this one is the closest I could find. Part of what I love is its beauty and uniqueness. There are variations on colors, but I chose the shimmery gold.Practicalities, 16 ounces is a nice, large mug and it's insulated. It keeps my coffee hot. It doesn't feel hot on the outside. It also has a seal in the cap to prevent any leaks. The edge I press my mouth to sip is smooth without sharp edges. The opening is wide enough that my nose doesn't bump it. It is a perfect diameter for my hand to hold. And, it probably won't break if it falls off the top of my car. Limitations I don't care about but probably worth mentioning, you can't use this on your stovetop, in the microwave, dishwasher, or freezer.

"This is a stainless steel men's watch. It can tell the time and date. It has three hands that rotate ""clockwise"" - second, minute, & hour. The circular face within its SS frame is 1.6 inches in diameter. It is covered in mineral glass. The SS watch band is interlinking that in a close up, look similar to the pattern in a brick wall. It has a clasp that can't be seen from the outside. One size would probably fit most average sized men. Some may need an adjustment. My fourth picture shows the tool they include for adjustment. There are 10 sections on the band with pins. To take a section apart, you push the pin out with that tool. Then you can reconnect it to a different section to make the band smaller.The presentation and packaging of this watch is impressive. It comes in a nice box with the band around a pillow. you also get a record card, fancy gift bag, owners manual, & hair clip. I thought the hair clip was a nice gesture. To get this beautiful watch in the mail, and with packaging that already far exceeded my expectations, and on top of that, as if they didn't already do enough, they're also going to add a hair clip. It kind of sends the message that this company goes all out for its customers.If I could change anything, I thought the watch was wrapped too tightly in plastic wrap. It was so tight, I didn't even know at first. I opened the box and was looking at the watch. It looked like the face of it was cracked. It took me 5 minutes to realize that was actually plastic wrapping. It's around the face and band like a second skin. It has to be carefully peeled off. While I was relieved it wasn't actually cracked, I was worried I would damage it when removing it. Although, I did eventually get it off and it has been keeping accurate time.

"This is a mini USB operated humidifier that holds 2.7 ounces of water. You don't have to measure it exactly. You just fill it up about 80% full. For the size, it does put out a surprising amount of moist air. You add water and let it sit for 3 minutes as the water is absorbed into the sponge stick. Then plug it into the USB, push the On button and watch it go. You can see a strong stream of fog coming out of it. If you place your hand a few inches above - you can feel it get moist.Scents: The owners manual is saying immoderate essential oil or perfume is not recommended. The description of this item says not to use it at all. So, this is not being sold as an aromatherapy diffuser. The benefits of it are creating some moist air around your computer work area for comfort. With that said, I did add some perfume. Just for this time to try it out. A a few drops. If you choose to do so, I probably wouldn't add more than a drop or two.This in a nice product, especially for anyone in a dry climate.

"I got six pairs of socks. It is two different argyle patterns - three of each. Argyle is the name of a pattern of intercrossing diamonds or diagonal lines. The material is soft ring-spun cotton. They feel and look like many dress socks made from a combo of polyester, cotton, spandex, & nylon. Color combos: Pattern one is black, gray-beige, army green, & blue-gray. Pattern two is chocolate brown, army green, darkest blue, & gray-beige. The size is for a men's shoe size 6-12. The style is somewhat unisex and I think men or women can wear these. I'm an adult woman with a 8.5 to 9 shoe size and they fit well.When you turn these inside out, you can see sewing fringes or threads as if each diagonal piece was sewn in separately. And yet, that is in no way apparent from the outside. It looks to be all one piece. They also feel comfy and well-made. These socks are Made in Pakistan. That was surprising, as I'm used to seeing everything either made in the US or China. I like how the foot and ankle is a solid color and the calf has the argyle pattern.

"This mask is absurd and adorable and a little bit sinister. When I first saw it on Amazon my reaction was, ""Aaah, how cute!"" Seeing it in person I feel the same. Although, I do find something about it a little unsettling or sinister...maybe it's just that I'm home alone right now and it's sitting here on its stand watching me write this review. lol. At least I took a bunch of pictures, so you can be the judge. I got this in plenty of time for Halloween! This is perfect for dressing up on Halloween or just everyday weirdness.It's 100% latex and surprisingly comfortable. I think it's kind of one-size-fits-most. Although, I probably wouldn't have a young child wear this, maybe teenager and older. I'm an adult woman and can easily slip this over my head, even while wearing glasses. Vision is limited. I can see through the nostrils and mouth, not to the sides. I wouldn't recommend walking around in traffic with this on Halloween night, unless you had someone holding your hand and looking out for you. This is better for safer, unicorn approved indoor surroundings.This is a white unicorn with vivid blue eyes and a fluffy mane. It has good detail and the latex is very strong.

"The cool white under-cabinet light gives off enough brightness to light up a small area. I turned off all the lights in my house and threw this under my desk. The area under my desk lit up fairly well. If I was still, it would automatically shut off in a minute or so but would come back on as soon as I crossed my legs or kicked out my foot in front of me. This has 10 LED lights that go down the length of it (with a lifespan of 80,000 hours or more) and as I mentioned, it's also motion activated. It's estimated the batteries will last approx. 6 months on average use. It's easy to change the batteries. You just slide off the cover at the end and insert (4) AAA.I actually bought 2 of these: warm white and cool white. The last picture shows a comparison between the two - they are identical except the cool white is clear without the yellow tinge. I haven't decided yet where to put them. I'm considering outside near the door, but trying to figure out a good spot where they would never get wet. In all these pictures I took it was pitch dark - I was out on my patio in the middle of the night.These are only about 1-1/4 inches wide by 7-1/2 inches. Smaller than I somehow imagined but great for lighting up dark corners and I love how they can be placed anywhere. If I could change anything about them, I would add on an on/off switch in addition to the motion sensor. But overall, I really like these!

"The warm white under-cabinet light is powered by four AAA batteries. No electricity, cord, or outlet needed - it can be taken anywhere. It's not solar powered so it doesn't rely on the sun. It doesn't require mounting or hardware - it's lightweight and can be mounted to surfaces with the included adhesive tape on back. Being battery operated it's sort of the same concept as a flashlight, except it has 10 LED lights that go down the length of it (with a lifespan of 80,000 hours or more) and it's also motion activated.I actually bought 2 of these: warm white and cool white.

"The color and consistency of this reminds me a lot of Luseta's argan oil shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner is thick, white and creamy. The shampoo is white, thinner, with an almost sticky feel to it. This is great for normal to dry hair and does help smooth and get the frizzies out. I would compare it to the Loreal Eversleek sulfate free. The Luseta Keratin shampoo is also sulfate-free (great if you color or process your hair) and it also makes it much softer and smoother.

"This cushion can make any chair super-comfy. I already have one at home - I decided to get one for work as well. These are great for anyone that sits for long periods of time. I never realized I needed one until I tried it and could feel what a difference it made. I wouldn't want to be without one now. The indentation goes towards the back of the chair where your tail bone is. It raises you up slightly higher. This one is about 2-3/4 inch thick but you'll sink into it a bit.

"This is a bright red, well-made leash with 2 handles - one to keep your dog at a short distance (about 12-15 inches) and the normal one at about 45-47 inches. Mainly, I just use the longer one which has comfortable inner leather padding. In the last few months, I've been leash training GaGa and she's doing much better - a choke collar is what finally helped her learn the most. She used to get excited and pull every which way and trying to handle them both was a bit much. Since I don't have time to walk them separate I've just taught her she needs to just walk near my side and not be darting back and forth. But then every once in a while, her and CoCo will see another animal and it's good to have a strong leash like this, just in case.The Hand in Hand leash is sewn well and is 1 inch thick with a sturdy swivel metal latch.

"All of the other flashlights I have purchased recently have gone to use for outdoor, farm/ranch, camping, hunting, etc. uses but this one -- is staying in the house (or in my purse sometimes)!  I keep it handy for looking for stuff in kitchen cabinets, behind furniture, and all other dark places (like my purse) where you need to find something.  It is slim, very stylish looking sitting on the kitchen counter, and VERY bright.  I set it on the counter bulb side down and it stands at attention, ready to go when I need it.  Great little tactical LED flashlight for the price.  Does not look or feel like a cheap flashlight.  Easy push button on/off switch and a strap.  Comes in a nice box, perfect gift for anyone.  They will think you spent more than $10, that is for sure.  AOR always comes through with good, high quality flashlights for use in every aspect of your life and this Sparker F30 5W does not disappoint in the very least.DISCLOSUREThe Maker has provided me with this product at a reduced price for review and feedback based on my first-hand usage of the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM5DKFUPJ9VXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9MVX26#wasThisHelpful","RM5DKFUPJ9VXH","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We all know how beneficial certain kinds of clay is for your skin but Glacial marine clay!?  The BEST kind of clay there is with many therapeutic & healing properties.  After a long, stressful day at work, my new favorite way to de-stress and relax is to change into some comfy clothes, wash the makeup off my face, apply some ATAL Glacial Clay Mask to my face, pour a glass of wine (or tea), and let the clay work it's magic.  Immediately you feel a very pleasant invigorating cool feeling, as the clay dries and works it's magic on your skin.  As it drys, your face feels ever so slightly tight, a good feeling, far from overly tight.  I can feel the work stress lines on my face getting smoother and tighter.  I let it completely dry, which is about 15 minutes, then rinse.  It is very easy to rinse off.  After drying gently with a soft towel, I apply a little ATAL Vitamin C Serum (love the stuff!), let that dry, then apply a little of my favorite moisturizer and I am ready for anything.  I was truly amazed at how refreshed and dewy it made my skin look.  It is a perfect product for a special ""home spa"" experience, for a special occasion, or when you just need a lift after a long day.  I could use this every day but I am going to control myself.  My skin looked refreshed, tighter, smoother, and in turn, made me feel more confident.  I looked at some other clay masks at a popular cosmetic website and the ingredients in the ATAL mask are right up there, most times even better, than the masks that cost $50 and above.  And I could find none with the high end clay this one has.  This is a STEAL!  I should also note that my face is pretty sensitive these days and nothing in this mask irritated my skin in the slightest.  Quite the opposite -- it was soothing and made my skin look pretty dang good.Side Note:  I burnt my hand in the oven and a couple of days later, for the heck of it (it was hurting really bad), I put a small dab of the ATAL Glacial Clay Gel Mask on it.  I mean look at the ingredients;  vitamin B3, vitamin E, aloe vera -- all good for your skin and very healing.  Immediately felt sooooo good and soothing.  After it dried, I washed it well.  I did this a couple of times and it seemed to heal faster.I am a HUGE fan of ATAL products and have a nice mix of products that I have purchased from them the last couple of years.  Occasionally, I am offered a product to sample for my honest review and it is always easy to review ATAL products because I truly love their stuff.  Every single one has been top notch, high quality ingredients that rival the expensive high end product of similar type, at a great price.  You won't be disappointed in product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMH805OE8ADCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q88V1II#wasThisHelpful","RMH805OE8ADCC","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased two AOR flashlights and when they arrived, my husband immediately put dibs on this one, the AOR, Cree LED Ultra Bright Flashlight Series, which was fine with me because I liked the other one, the AOR Multifunction High Flashlight, (my review for that one is posted).  He uses this one more than I so I will type his comments out for my review.  He says it is really bright, just as bright as his old tactical style flashlight and easier to handle and use.  It has an adjustable lens so you can zoom in or out the beam of light.  It is very well constructed and rugged and appears to be shockproof.  He loves the nice padded, well protected case which will be nice for camping, fishing, all stuff outdoors.The chargers are super simple to use, you don't need instructions.  Just plug in the wall and go.  Will be purchasing an extra battery to have on hand.  The battery has a shelf life of 10 years which is really good.He really loves this flashlight and is amazed at how well made and functional it is.  Hard to get a man to get more detailed about his flashlight but the fact that he loves it, and won't let me use it (I lose stuff),  tells me it is a dang good flashlight!  Great gift!

"Ok, I've had a lot of good flashlights so reviewing a flashlight isn't the easiest thing to review because what can you say? It lights up, turns on and off...Well, this flashlight, the AOR Multifunction High Flashlight (FA-08), is easier to review because it is a ""seriously cool flashlight"" (picky husband quote after using his AOR flashlight, more below).  I have a couple of other flashlights from this company, AOR, and have been very pleased and pleasantly surprised at the quality.  These flashlights are VERY well made and well worth the price.MORE:  I need a very bright flashlight and this one is BRIGHT!  We were sitting out by the fire pit last night and I had my AOR flashlight with me, like always when I am outside in the dark, and was amazed at some of the things I was able to zoom in on, using the zoom dial on the flashlight.  Great feature-  you can zoom in to pinpoint an object for a very bright view or adjust it for a large diameter view that is still bright enough to see the landscape.  The  birdhouse in the photo below was about 50-60 feet away and very high up in a tree.  I could see it like it was daylight.  Had to take a fast photo, hence the quality, because the light was disturbing the nesting birds inside.  Heard some noise in the horse pasture and shone my AOR light down the field and saw a fox eating spilled grain!  Had no idea we had a fox.  I LOVE this flashlight!More excellent features:  What we both like a lot about the two AOR flashlights we received is the included battery charger.  I will always have charged batteries ready to go.  There is also an adapter to charge AAA batteries too.  And, and adapter to use AAA batteries in the flashlight.  So many options!  Easy to always have batteries fresh and ready to use.  When I used to travel alone frequently, someone purchased for me, one of those huge black, old school law enforcement type flashlights that I felt good having but not to easy to pack around.  It was pricey too, well over $60, and had to use 6 big, expensive D/DD batteries..  These AOR flashlights are every bit as bright but way easier to keep handy for emergencies and for those things that go bump in the night.  Glovebox, purse, pocket, nightstand, anywhere you need it.I recently purchased two AOR flashlights (I am a repeat customer and was offered a discount promo code to test and give an *honest* review.  I rely on reviews for my purchases and my reviews are 100% honest and hopefully helpful too) and when they arrived, my husband immediately put dibs on the other one (which will be another review), which was fine, because I wanted this one.  Oh, and worth mentioning --- comes in a nice box with padded slots for all your chargers, adapters, and flashlight.  GREAT GIFT!  An especially great MAN GIFT!

"We have an elderly semi-retired working dog -- Rosie the Border Collie, that in the last  2 to 3 years, has shown a substantial slow down in her usual activities such as keeping the goat in line, keeping the deer out of the yard, helping at feed time, playing ball, catching the frisbee; she cannot even jump into the back of our pickup truck anymore.  So sad because she lives for these things.  We decided she needed some major help, via a good solid supplement, with quality ingredients that work.  The 4 major ones:  Tumeric curcumin, MSM, chondroitin, and glucosomine.  All shown to be effective in studies for animals and humans.  So, when I was offered a small discount for an honest review of the Infinite Joint Advanced Formula dog supplements, it was like it was meant to be, a match made in heaven.  I happily accepted the challenge and was even happier for Rosie that the supplements did help her and I was able to write this honest review, and not have to send them back!When I received the product and saw the list of ingredients I was pretty sure it was a no-brainer, that they would work.  Heck, the stuff in these pills would  be good to ease human pain too, BUT, of course, this supplement is for DOGS, you'd have to go to the natural food store and get one made for humans, but thank goodness there is this one for our furry family members.  We at first tried giving to her as a treat (I know silly us!) but she is the smartest breed so you have to be a little trickier.  We just crush one up and mix with her wet food -- one in the morn and one in the evening.  After only 1 week we saw results.  She was playful again and even started following the husband out in the morning when he feeds the livestock.  That shocked and overjoyed him as he had missed his feeding helper.  She used to just stay in bed and watch him feed.  That was HUGE!  She runs like a puppy again, and just seems overall happier with her life.  The whole family is grateful to see this change in the poor old dog.  Even though I am cheap by nature, I will continue to buy Infinite dog supps, very small price to pay for a happy old dog that may not have much time left on this earth.  She needs to be as happy, and as pain free, as possible.  She has been a great dog and deserves it!PS:  The supps that are similar to Infinite are double the price at my vet and the local feed store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1MUDOEZJZWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V45IQF6#wasThisHelpful","R2M1MUDOEZJZWV","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All natural and no harmful ingredients are a MUST for my supplements so before purchasing the Calamari Ink Products Super Calanchovy Omega-3 supplements,  I needed to research the long scientifically named ingredients that I did not recognize.  I compared the ingredients to a popular all natural brands version of fish (non salmon) supplements.  They all passed, for my standards at least, and I like to think of them as high.  Quick breakdown if you are interested:***hydrochloride is a salt resulting, or regarded as resulting, from the reaction of hydrochloric acid with an organic base (most commonly an amine).***Tocopheryl acetate, also known as vitamin E acetate, is a common vitamin supplement.***Pyridoxine is one form of vitamin B6.***Cyanocobalamin is the most common and widely produced form of the chemical compounds that have vitamin B12 activity.At first, I though the Calanchovy supplements were a little more pricey than other brands until I realized it contains squid ink.  Squid ink, common in Italian and Spanish cooking is very high in iron and antioxidants.  Studies are showing that it protects white blood cell production, which helps give your immunity a boost, and studies have found that the ink possesses antitumor and antibacterial characteristics.  And very heart healthy friendly.  In addition to the omega 3 fatty acids from the fish, it is SUPER and I cannot find any other supplement that uses squid ink in supplements.  The studies of squid ink for health are many and VERY promising.  Your health is worth it. Black is the new green!!I've been taking it for about 2 weeks now and have been around sick people I have manged to stay healthy.  No weird fishy after-taste at all.  And I like that you only have to take 1, so that works out to about .41/cents a pill, which is pretty good considering it is not your average omega 3 pill and you are getting more than just one supplement.  I cannot wait to get my blood results next time I go to the doctor.  I did receive a special price to try this product during a promotional event,  and am very happy that I was chosen to try it.  I am 51 and really need to step up the omega -3's to protect my heart health and overall health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IRT2VQLF1760/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYMIH4U#wasThisHelpful","R2IRT2VQLF1760","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a HUGE fan of vitamin C serum, have used a few different brands, and the Toulon serum did not disappoint.  Very generous amount for the price, especially for a serum that has such high quality ingredients and more importantly, works.  I use it 2-3 times a week and what I like the most about it, it that it tightens and smooths my skin without being overly tight and uncomfortable.  Maybe that is due to the addition  jojoba oil.  I apply a thin coat on my face after cleansing, and, occasionally, when my face felt a little too tight, I just apply a tiny dab of my regular moisturizer over it.  My skin really is noticeably smoother and tighter since I have been using this product.  Perfect for when you want your skin to look dewy and fresh for a special event or even everyday.  I didn't really understand how some reviews said they got no results at all.  I see results every time I use it!More of why I love this product:  A lot of Vitamin C serums have ingredients in them that can actually harm your skin like preservatives, or DMAE and retinyl palmitate.  The ingredient list on the Toulon serum meets my high standards for putting on my skin.  You have to be so careful, way too many products out there that have harmful ingredients.  Natural and/or organic is very important to me.  Also, for a Vitamin C serum to be the most effective and for proper absorption, it needs to have a vitamin ration of 10% or above, with 20% being optimal.  The Toulon has 20%.What has REALLY sold me on the Toulon brand of vitamin C serum is the price for what you get.  I went to a very popular online seller of cosmetics and looked at 8 different brands of Vit C Serum ranging in price from $45 to $155, all the same size at Toulon, 1 oz.  The ingredients were almost all the same!  Unbelievable!  You don't need a fancy ""name brand"" to get spa-like results, that is for sure.  I did receive a promo code in exchange for an honest review of this product and my review is honest and truly the experience I had.  There really is nothing to NOT like about this product so it was an easy review.  Well, one small thing, the pump is great but be careful to make sure it is pointed at your hand.  It comes out fast and I have squirted product the wrong way a few times.  Too precious to waste!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R276Y8PW22CUY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXB0YTS#wasThisHelpful","R276Y8PW22CUY8","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am new to matcha but after my experience with Coolahoo Japanese Organic Matcha, am hooked and it will be a part of my tea/health regime for the rest of my life.  I drink a lot of green tea for the many health benefits and one serving of matcha tea is the nutritional equivalent of 10 cups of regularly brewed green tea.  I feel victorious after drinking 3 cups of regular green tea a day --  10 is a HUGE victory!!  There are so many health benefits to matcha that to me drinking a cup a day is a no-brainer.  I feel healthier and have more energy, which is not easy at my age and work schedule.  And, I am trying to lose weight and the extra energy has given me the metabolism boost I need to get, and keep me motivated.  The top 2 benefits that attracted me to matcha was weight loss and cancer prevention.  Simply put, the chemicals in green tea, especially EGCG and ECG, inhibit tumor growth and protect cells.  There are pages and pages of research to support those claims, which I have read.  Very interesting say the least.I usually just dive right into something but reading, or at least skimming the free e-book first is very helpful.  Lots of creative and delicious looking recipes -- matcha ice cream!  yowza!  Cannot wait to make and taste it.  After reading the e-book one of my goals is to develop, make, and photograph a super yummy matcha recipe and share with Coolahoo, with the hope they like it and may use it in their e-book in the future.  Sound like a good goal to me!When I made my first cup of tea with the powder I thought it might need honey, but after another cup with no honey, it tastes just as good without it.  I read the one negative review recently and I did not find it bitter at all.  I actually find the taste very pleasant.  I am new to matcha but not new to knowing what tastes good.  Also,  I have just used a spoon to mix so far, and have had no problems with clumping at all.  Very smooth but I am going to invest in a bamboo whisk because I am in this for the long term now.  The price is very reasonable for high quality, organic, matcha.  I will stick with Coolahoo when I purchase more.Work-Days:  I have found that this Coolahoo Japanese Organic Matcha powdered green tea is absolutely perfect for the afternoon work day slump.  I've been reaching for a simple cup of matcha tea or a quick matcha tea latte that has helped my concentration and energy level to make it through the day.  Simple --  1 tsp matcha power and 2 oz hot water, stir/whisk into a smooth paste, add 4 oz milk.  I use almond milk.  A battery operated frother would be perfect to keep at the office.  Next on my list to purchase but still good without the ""frothing"".  I wish I had discovered the benefits of matcha sooner, but better late than never.  Matcha Cookies (recipe in the free e-book) is what I am going to make for my afternoon snack at work next week.I am a fan of this product/company and would really like to connect on Facebook but all the links the e-book provided are broken.  I'll try to find them myself on social media.I had already been reading about the health benefits of matcha and was ready to try, so when I was offered a promo code to try and review Coolahoo Organic Matcha I jumped on it.  I was a perfect test subject because I take my health *and* my reviews very seriously.  I did a lot of research and I am very happy to have discovered, and now reaping the benefits, of matcha.  I am trying to rid my middle of some belly fat and matcha is supposed to be excellent for that.  I will update my review in a few weeks if that happens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PYKSA6AQMO8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKFA1MQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PYKSA6AQMO8Y","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love Love Love!!  This Mooi Tech Bluetooth Speaker is a good looking little bugger too!  Even though the instructions were way better than other bluetooth devices I've had, I still had trouble, but it was completely my fault.  Ya gotta hold the on button down for a few seconds-  DUH!!!  It tells you ""power on"" and ""power off"" which is super helpful to me.  So dang simple!  Paired up fast and easy to my PC (yay online radio) and my iPod.  I was able to take the speaker all over the house and yard when paired with the laptop or my iPod.  I love that you can  take it all over and it still stays paired.  I charged it using the USB port on my laptop and it charged up fast.  Came with a really nice fabric bag to keep your speaker in.  VERY nice touch!We had a BBQ last night with some friends and everyone was trying to share music on their phones so I ran in and got my Mooi Tech Bluetooth speaker and everyone took turns pairing up with it and blasting our music!  I was using an iPod and the others had android phones.  The sound is excellent and can be turned up very loud.  The best volume and sound so far of all my bluetooth speakers.  I accidentally left it outside in the drippy fog all night and when my husband brought it in, he apologized for it being wet.  HA!  It is waterproof!  And it was still charged up.  Played for about another hour after being left on all night.  My sister has a waterproof bluetooth by her pool that she paid over $60 for at a big box store and everyone liked mine, the Mooi Tech speaker, better.I love music in the shower so I take it with me there too.  First time I tried suctioning it to the shower it fell off and bounced off the floor.  Never stopped playing, so I am very happy that it is tough too, as I am hard on stuff sometimes.  I hadn't used a suction cup in a long time and didn't get it wet enough to stick.  Once I did that, it was stuck like glue.  Very strong suction which was impressive.  Oh, don't forget to close the flap at the charge port when in the shower.  I didn't and mine got wet but didn't hurt it.  I don't want to take any chances as I love this speaker and want it to last.I haven't tried the camping strap and hooks yet but I certainly will (another nice touch added in the package).  It will be perfect for hooking to a tree when camping or even your bike.  This Mooi Tech speaker would make an awesome gift for the sportsman in your life.  It can be taken camping, fishing, boating, hiking, anywhere you go.  My husband has hijacked the Mooi for his boat so now he is purchasing another for me.  I received the first one with a promo code for my honest review and buying another at full price.  I rely on honest reviews when I shop so it is important to me to be honest and helpful.  I truly do not think you will be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUTOZ8IE6LX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY8SRY4#wasThisHelpful","R2GUTOZ8IE6LX2","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love lots of pepper on everything!  Especially fresh salads and veggies.  I haven't had a fresh pepper mill in years, and have never owned an electric cordless one.  I forgot how savory fresh ground pepper can be!  First of all, the Eukein Electric Mill looks great on my kitchen counter.  Glass and brushed stainless steel -- my favorite.  After I stopped staring at it, the batteries and pepper were very easy to load.  The $1 pack of AA batteries has lasted a long time ,  and I've been using this mill a lot for the last 2 weeks.  No turning and turning a non-electric pepper mill  -- you can use your pinky finger to get as much fresh ground pepper as you want.  I also like that you can easily adjust the coarseness of it.  I love milling up a generous sprinkling of coarse pepper on an olive oil and sea salt rubbed steak and then searing on a hot pan to perfection  --  easy pepper steak!  I like medium coarse for salads.  At the table, as this is very portable, everyone can change the setting to their preference.  The cap on the bottom helps keep the pepper fresh.  Peppercorns can keep for over a year or longer but I don't have to worry about that, I use it too fast, but some folks may not.And, black pepper is good for your health too so my new Eukein Mill is making it easier for the whole family to get the health benefit of eating more pepper.  Black pepper is what they call a carminitive, a substance that helps digestion and that promotes sweating and urination.  It works like this:  It stimulates the taste buds in such a way that an alert is sent to to the stomach to increase hydrochloric acid secretion, thereby improving digestion. Hydrochloric acid is necessary for the digestion of proteins and other food components in the stomach.  It also has impressive antioxidant and antibacterial effects, and they say (I hope it is true) that the outer layer of the peppercorn stimulates the breakdown of fat cells, keeping you slim while giving you energy to burn.  PASS THE PEPPER PLEASE!I received a promotional price for my honest review and it was an easy review to do because I truly love the Eukein Mill.  I will not use it for salt, not yet at least, because I use pre-ground sea salt, very sparingly, so will concentrate on using it for peppercorns.  I use the Eukein Mill a lot so if you have any questions, I can certainly try to answer.  I feel like a professional chef using this!  Would make a great gift for the foodies in your life or a very useful splurge for yourself.  I bought another for my sister and she loves it as much as I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECKO4D3DXWK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STV08AY#wasThisHelpful","R1ECKO4D3DXWK2","A3DZLBN56A1MQ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DZLBN56A1MQ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These 18"" Felt Christmas Stockings are the PERFECT set for my family.  Each stocking has a handy hangar on the left side for easy hanging.  They are sewn evenly and tightly and seem durable enough to stuff treats into (or coal).  I really love how each one is different, and my kids love that they can pick a special character for their stocking.  The reindeer one is my favorite.  The colors are bright, and as simple as the designs are they are festive and absolutely adorable.  These are an excellent addition to any kind of Christmas decoration - either super fancy/elegant decor or casual.  The stockings add a little bit of cute personality and are great for adults or children.  I know I love them, but will give them to my kids.  Two of the stockings have a red backing and the one Santa stocking is green.  The character design on the front is tightly sewn so it's almost flush with the stocking.  It's a thinner material so it's not bulky or heavy to hang up.  I'm very excited to hang these up and have Santa fill them!

"This is such a different toy/accessory, but I had to have it because my son loves ""Bob Bob"" or Spongebob (he barely talks).  There are three bright yellow microfiber cloths with a Spongebob Squarepants head, so each of my sons got one and I gave one to my daughter (she's 14).  My daughter has hers hanging up in her bedroom for decoration and my boys use it for random things.  I've found this sitting in the toy shopping cart (so he must have been a grocery item) amongst other places in the house.  Since this is microfiber and a really great length I have used it to clean my television and dust other places in my house.  Microfiber does a great job dusting mini blinds.  It launders very well and dries quickly.  I do use fabric softener in my laundry, but you're not supposed to with microfiber.  This is a great deal - it's like 3 products in one!

"I love this smart charger.  Currently at home AND at work I struggle to find enough outlets to charge my phone, my Kindle, my fiance's phone and my many portable chargers.  I usually have to time it out and they each take a turn charging.  Well not anymore!  First of all, this NRGized 30W 4-Port USB Charger is small and compact.  The whole ""machine"" is not even five inches long.  It fits in the palm of my hand.  The piece that plugs into the outlet is on the bigger side, though.  The cord is a good length, but unnecessary in my case since the way I have it set up I don't need more than 24 inches.  This has a nice sleek design in white and is extremely easy to use.  It literally takes no more than plugging it in together and in to the outlet.  Done.  I love being able to plug in my Android products along with my fiances Apple products.

"Every night, after the kids go to bed, my fiance and I have ice cream cones. It's our private treat that we don't have to share with anyone else! I like cookies & cream flavored, and he likes peanut butter cup. Prior to getting this Kitchen Panda Ice Cream Scoop we would fight with a tablespoon and the carton of ice cream. The shape of this Kitchen Panda scoop just makes sense. It's narrower than the usual ice cream scoop, and this makes it much easier to dig into the frozen treat and also place it in the cone. Building the perfect ice cream cone is like an art - you need the proper tools and a steady hand. I've noticed with the shape of this, and the material it's made from, it glides right through the ice cream without me having to fight with it! Using this scoop cut the time it takes me to make a cone by at least 1/3, and the shape and depth of the ice cream looks better too! The handle is comfortable and easy to hold.  Plus I really like the orange color.  This washes off easily with soap and water, or is dishwasher safe.  I will never use a different scoop ever again!

When I saw this Thanksgiving Decoration set in person I knew exactly what I was going to do with it!  There are 250 leaves - I have been taping and pinning the leaves up around the office.  These leaves come in different colors (all autumn colors) and are very light.  The pine cones, gourds and pumpkins are small, but still have great detail and look realistic.  We have a glass jar/vase in the center of our open office on a cabinet.  I put the gourds/pumpkins in the jar and then placed the pine cones on the top.

"I got this Arozell Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Case for my mother-in-law.  She has the Galaxy and did not have a case for it.  She was always worried about dropping it, scratching it, and for some reason always letting my two year old play with it!  I chose the rose red color because I thought it was different (and girly), and in person it's very pretty.  This case has a slight flexibility to it, but you can tell it's durable.  I like that it has two layers - the underside/inside is black and the external side is the rose red.  There are cut outs where the camera and buttons are for easy access.  There is no protection on the screen, so there is still a chance it can get scratched BUT the sides are raised and the corners have shock absorbency.

"This Magic Rainbow Spring Assortment Pack is a pretty good product for a few different reasons.  I would choose to use these either as favors for a party (in a goody bag) or as a prize for winning a game.  I'd even use these as stocking stuffers at Christmastime.  Since I have young boys and no parties in the near future I let them open the box and play with them.  I did take two of the springs and give them to my nephew.  There are six blue/purple/sparkle springs and six yellow/pink/green springs.  I was alarmed at first because these arrive totally stiff (not like a spring), but gently pulling the end will release it and it will become a spring.  My only complaint is how easily these bend and tangle up.  Obviously they are a spring so tangling is expected, but these seem to twist and bend much easier than other springs I've tried.  These are definitely better for older kids that know to be careful.  Like I said, great party favors or prizes.

"My fiance loves these VECOO Men's Outdoor Sandals.  His brother and father also put them on and ran to the store, and they also loved them.  They have not worn these to the beach, but the sandals have been worn while doing errands and playing outside with the kids.  I keep hearing how comfortable the sandals are and out of all the shoes my fiance has, he chooses to wear these VECOO ones.  The shoes are breathable and lightweight.

"Sure this stuff isn't super appetizing and doesn't smell great, but it works!  It actually smells like burning rubber, and when stirred into warm water, it turns the water gray. The odor doesn't dissipate. It stays potent and in your face.Sometimes beneficial things require hard work and sacrifice. While ingesting this Purblack Shilajit I plug my nose while I drink it down. Since I ball it up on using my fingers I can smell it on my fingertips afterwards. I sacrifice my morning coffee just to get this awesome product in my system.  Since I have been taking it I feel more alert, more energized, I sleep better and less crabby. I would rather feel like I do now and deal with the burning tire than go back to how I was.This comes in a tub type container with screw top lid. It isn't very pliable so it will take some practice to get it out and balled up. A little bit every day is all a person needs!Highly recommend.

"These Heavy Duty Plastic Silverware are great to have. Since so many pieces comes in this set, I take a pack or two to work. That still leaves me enough to use at home. I have children and we go through so many dishes and silverware. Now I just use a plastic utensil for certain meals. It's so much more convenient and time saving. There was one time that my son used too much pressure and the fork snapped it half. Even though it says heavy duty these are still breakable. Each piece is thicker than your average store-brand plastic silverware so that probably adds to the durability. Super convenient to me and saves me time - not washing dishes as often.

"I love this stuff! I cannot pinpoint what this smells like - it's almost a masculine scent.  Like a cologne. I know it's a good scent because even my fiance likes it, and he complains about all of the air fresheners I use. This comes in a convenient 2 fl. oz pump bottle. I can easily take it to work with me in my purse, and also stick it in my pocket when I go to the bathroom. I use this Mask spray many different ways. First I use it the correct way and spray the toilet water before going number two. I also spray the garbage can in between bag changes, and I use it as air freshener when my fiance or son toots. It works well in every situation. It definitely masks every odor and smells SO good. I'm actually standing in my bathroom right now because I sprayed it into the air. I love it that much!

"These are really pretty awesome.  I never thought to extend my bra strap - I would only shove my boobs and back fat into a bra that kept getting smaller on me!  I really love this Loritta 35 piece extender set.  There is a color for every bra and then some.  My only complaint is that some of my bras have thinner bands or only two hooks, so I had to finagle this three hook extender onto my two hook bra.  Not a big deal, though.  These extenders are good quality - they look and feel like the clasp portion of a bra, made with the same material.  The clasps are all sewn in securely and the hook is tight.

"I love toner and I cannot complete my skincare regimen without applying toner after cleansing.  I personally don't utilize the pump dispenser but I do see how convenient it is!  I like to apply toner directly to a cotton ball and sweep it over my face, then let it dry.  Elrique Naturals has great products in general, so I knew I would love this Vitamin C Facial Toner.  I personally don't care that it's organic, but I know some people who need that in their life.  I care about results, and this toner gives results.  It dries quickly and doesn't leave any weird residue on my face.  I do apply toner and moisturizer after the toner is dry.  My skin tone has looked more even lately, and the only product I've changed is the toner, so I know I owe it to Elrique Naturals.  Any little breakouts I was having have stopped.

"I needed this Perfect Life Ideas Silicone Pot Handle Holder about 8 months sooner.  My father gave me a pots and pan set which happened to be a material I don't know?  Maybe they're stainless steel?  Anyway, the entire set is silver and metal.  Even the handles of every pan/pot.  When those pots and pans have been sitting on the heat they are unbearable to touch; actually impossible to touch!  I've had to cook with a potholder on my hand, or a towel wrapped up around it.  Using either of those two ways is not comfortable at all.  I ordered this pot handle holder in green.  I personally love the vibrant color.  Using it with my pans is very easy.  There is a slit on the entire length so it slips on easily.  It covers the entire handle on all of my pans. It's actually thicker than I expected.

I can't explain the feeling my elbow felt when I put the compression sleeve because I cannot find the words.  It felt instantly relaxed.  I've been wearing it for a few hours per day, and even with the extended wear there is no odor.  The material is nylon and it is flexible for motion.

I actually forgot I owned it most of the time and I would just make my burgers by hand rolling/pressing.  This Burger Press by P.I.P.E is seriously the best thing to make burgers, hands down.

This press limits the thickness of the burgers I make but making them this size makes cooking easier and even.  Clean up is very easy (hand wash with warm soapy water or top rack dishwasher safe).

"I put these on my bed tonight and they are decent.  When I think of flannel I think of a very soft material.  These 100% cotton flannel sheets don't have the typical flannel feeling to them, but they are still comfortable.  The color is a deep burgundy red that I *think* will fade in the first few washes.  To play it safe I will wash alone in cold so the color doesn't bleed onto my other laundry.  I think I put the fitted sheet on the wrong direction because it seemed tighter when I got to corner number four.  The sheets fit snugly, but the corners don't stay.  By the time morning comes the mattress is showing at every corner. The flat sheet covered my queen bed completely with extra fabric on each side.  Definitely enough to tuck in when I make the bed.

"I enjoy wearing wigs any time to any place.  It doesn't have to be Halloween for me to put a wig on and wear it, but it helps if it is some sort of holiday!  I chose to get the VOROSY Cosplay Wig in Light Blonde which isn't too drastic from my natural hair color.  The color doesn't look too shocking - it's actually a very natural, pretty color.  I love the bangs and length.  I've been wanting to cut myself bangs but didn't want to commit to the style or growing them out, so this solves that beauty dilemma!  Since this wig is so long I do bring a wig comb with me to occasionally comb it out and keep it flowy.  It comes packaged up flat in a thin box so you will need to bring it out and comb it before the first wear.  There is a small amount of stitching that can be seen, but not enough to bother me.  Plus a headband or hat can be worn to hide it!  I do love that it's adjustable so it fits my head or my daughter's head.  I haven't washed it yet, but seeing that mild shampoo cleans it gives me peace of mind that I can take great care of it.  Great product for the price!

"I really, really love this Lover-Beauty Underbust Corset Waist Trainer.  I have about nine other corset waist trainers so I have plenty to compare this to.  First of all I sized up thinking they run small like the others that I have.  In my case I could have ordered the size I normally wear and it would have fit me.  Not a problem because I can just use the middle or innermost clasps.  When I looked at this corset I didn't think it would be comfortable because of how it goes over the shoulders but under the bust.  I was wrong!  It is SO COMFORTABLE.  I feel like my posture is better and I'm much skinnier when I have it on.  Hooking the sides together can be a bit of a challenge so I have my fiance help me get it on.  I've heard different opinions about waist training.  First and foremost proper diet and exercise must be followed along with drinking lots of water.  Mix that with waist training a few hours every day and that'll be a success!  This Lover-Beauty Corset Waist Trainer is latex so it does have a rubbery feel to it.

"""Thank you for the time I've been given. Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion. Thank you for telling me how it is but entertaining what I wanted it to be. Thank you for listening and for letting me into your lives again. Love Adele x""This is how the most successful female recording artist of this decade chooses to address her audience, in a short note on this, her hugely-anticipated follow-up to the record-breaking 2011 ""21"" album, a 30+ million seller. Indicative of her appreciation and good intentions, the note is every bit as honest as its writer, a 27 year-old lady, surprisingly composed and reserved, given her phenomenal success. Records have been broken already with the release of first single ""Hello"", and if one listens to ""25"", they will realise that, not only it was not rushed, but evidently the greatest effort was put in order to present an album worthy of its predecessor. In fact, ""25"" is better than ""21""; more well-crafted, accomplished, and intense, less simplistic, and just as emotional and heartfelt. At least half of the new songs could rival ""21""'s 3 smash hit singles. Highpoints are the rhythmic ""Send my love (To your new lover)"", the gentle ""Remedy"" (dedicated to her son), ""Love in the dark"", and ""Million years ago"", 2 gorgeous ballads.But this is an album that is solid throughout its 48-minute duration (60' for the deluxe, which adds 3 more tracks). Minimal but rich-sounding, with her voice front and center, ""25"" is a mature and subtle offering. Every possible aspect has been taken care of, from the actual songs, to the artwork (Adele is steadily developing into a Queen of black and white!); and the mastering is spotless - most will remember the terrible CD transfer of ""21"". Just days ago, Billboard reported that ""25"" is expected to become the fastest-selling album in the US since tracking began in 1991, with over 2.5 million copies in first-week sales based on projections by Sony Music. It seems to be a matter of time before these expectations are confirmed, but regardless of how ""25"" is going to perform, Adele is already a saviour, having generated an unprecedented interest, and breathing life in the music industry. ""25"" has everything it takes to become not only another million-seller, but, also, and more importantly, another timeless music collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GKBII6992X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WW10SA#wasThisHelpful","R32GKBII6992X0","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loathe manufactured bands but I love(d) the legendary Spice Girls. This is One Direction's fifth - and final for some time - album, their fifth November release in a row, their first as a four-piece, following the departure of the yummy Zayn Malik, and their last, before taking a much-needed break (they rolled non-stop since forming in 2010). 6 years (right, no more numbers) into their career, 1D are building upon a good foundation, with ""Made in the A.M."" expanding on the already existing template; the outcome is another great, ambitious pop-pock record. The songwriting is quite remarkable for their genre (on this 1D co-write 9 songs). With an overwhelming sense of levity and fun, and an effortless honesty even on the heartbreaking songs, one cannot help but get caught up in the whole affair. I fell instantly in love with their ""You and I"" single, and its accompanying brilliant video, when randomly watching it at a friend's house. If that can happen to a guy, then their immeasurable success can easily be explained.Because it's always the songs that matter. New single ""Perfect"", ""Infinity"", with its soaring synths and strings, the '80s-inspired soft-rocker ""What a feeling"", and the tender ballad ""If I could fly"", are some of this new set's strongest tracks. Noone is denying the fact that it is all manufactured and light-hearted, and although the songs are not bringing anything new or claiming originality, there is nothing wrong with that. Expecting some kind of musical masterpiece from 1D, is only laughable. However their achievements so far, are anything but. Boybands are serving a purpose; as long as they hold on to that, and are honest with their audience, they should be acknowledged for it. Sheer proof that talent shows can generate a successful career (and often exciting musical acts as well), 1D have been writing music history, entertaining the whole planet while breaking records along the way. They are a pop phenomenon which deserves praise for consistently producing solid, enjoyable pop; that's exactly what ""Made in the A.M."" is.Note: Closing track, ""History"", an almost acoustic, singalong number, is a telling swansong.

"Who would've thought that Justin Bieber was capable of such an unexpected turn! Just as the cover suggests, on this, his 4th outing, he appears less of a mainstream crowd pleaser, presenting a succession of subdued and introverted songs, addressing his troubled adolescence, emphasizing his remorse, and his desire to be cleansed. All the more apologetic and mournful, this is his chance to say sorry, and while he is doing it, he exhibits a clear vision for his sound. A sleek mixture of electro-pop, urban R'n'B, stripped-back digital beats, and off-beat vocal samples, brings attention on his soft, supple singing, assisted by personal lyrics, and surprising restraint exercised throughout. The result is a regretful look back and a fresh start, emotionally, and musically. The presence of EDM star Skrillex amongst the production credits, compliments Bieber's breathy voice, backing up the sense of a pretty major artistic transformation; from teen pop idol, Bieber is quietly blooming into a grown-up sophisticate.No.1 smash ""What do you mean?"", and last single ""Sorry"", are highpoints, along with opener ""Mark my words"", the funk-flavoured ""Company"", ""The feeling"", a dark duet with Halsey, electro-ballad - and brand new single - ""I'll show you"", trap track ""No sense"", and the title song which closes the album, a pensive piano ballad in which Bieber dedicates himself to God, defending his behaviour by saying that ""We weren't put in the best position to make the best decisions"". But the most honest, fragile, and sympathetic moment is to be found in ""I'll show you"", where he laments the strain of fame: ""I'm not made out of steel / Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real"". Affirming the notion of a young man who has come through testing times to emerge with new maturity and purpose, it looks as if JB is finally showing his best side to the public. Never thought the day would come that I'd say this, but Justin Bieber sounds pretty great. ""Purpose"" is surprisingly interesting and enjoyable, cool, even. Ain't that shocking!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116VFN57JALA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AM4BFQ#wasThisHelpful","R116VFN57JALA7","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took her really long, but her first fully-fledged seasonal album is here, 15 years since her Kylie-cious cover of ""Santa baby"" in 2000, a seasonal favourite since. Considering that most of her '80s peers have already presented at least one Christmas record, and the fact that she's been having at least one release of new, old, or tour material as often as every 2 years, it is rather surpring that Ms Minogue did not release a festive record sooner. ""Never too late"", though. ""Kylie's Christmas"" arrives 28 years into her recording career, and is as joyful and fun as anyone would expect from pop's eternal - and most beloved - princess (nevermind she's 47). As someone who never feels like struggling to impose her character in the music world all these years, this works in her favour on this particular album. What we get is a mix of classics and newly-penned festive songs, with Kylie doing on here what she has been doing all along, sticking to her fun and frothy formula. Those sweet vocals we first came to enjoy on her ""Abbey Road sessions"" album, are on this set, too; Kylie's mellow delivery on more subtle numbers is most splendid. Standouts include her take on The Pretenders' ""2,000 Miles"", the jazzy ""Oh Santa"", the Iggy Pop-assisted ""Christmas wrapping"", disco duet with sister, Dannii, ""100 Degrees"", and the Chris Martin-penned ""Every days's like Christmas"". It only takes a look at the cover photo and a couple of songs for the listener to feel the warm and cozy atmosphere, giving the impression that Kylie sings ""especially for you"", making you dream of being right next to her amidst presents and decorations, having a cuddle. Mmm, how I'd love to ""kiss her once"" under the mistletoe ...""I should be so lucky""!Note: Deluxe edition is the one to buy, as it contains 6 new tracks (3 of the standard edition, and another 3), plus a 6 video DVD of Kylie in the studio (if you thought you can't love her any more, you'll reconsider!). A limited white vinyl edition will be released on 27 November, too.

"Overlooked by mass audiences, pop chameleon Mylene Farmer enjoys the adoration of millions in her native France, where, in the course of her 3-decade career, she has evolved from popstress to pop Empress. With 56 singles (14 of which No. 1s), 30+ million records sold, and an endless array of awads, accolades, and records broken, she is enjoying royal status and success equal to that of Madonna. A true artist in every aspect of her work, every album, single, video, and tour, is a special event. ""Interstellaires"", her 10th studio effort, comes 2 years after ""Monkey me"", the album that ""corrected"" the slight misstep that was 2011's ""Bleu noir"". Of course, as her fans know so well, in her case misstep does not mean bad. Because those who have experienced records such as the sublimely brilliant ""L'autre..."", ""Anamorphosee"", ""Innamoramento"", and ""Avant que l'ombre"", know the sky-high standards she sets with her releases. This new album finds her without her long-time collaborator Laurent Boutonnat. Although the first time they parted ways (""Bleu noir""), the result was evidently less spectacular than usual, this time around nearly all tracks on this new record are exceptional (just mentioning 2 highlights, ""C'est pas moi"", and the title track). Co-writer once again in all of these, she creates those sexy and hypnotic compositions she is so loved for through the years, completing the mysterious atmosphere with her astonishing, eerie vocals. Transcending the barrier of language, she remains as compelling as ever. Her unmistakable sound, a little more guitar-oriented than usual, but essentially pop, is nothing less than mesmerising. Dramatic, dark, haunting, irresistable. A true return to top form, ""Interstellaires"" is truly stellar.Note: As one of the very few artists who still produce special editions of her albums, ""Interstellaires"" is available in various formats (digipack edition, book edition, box set, vinyl), really a collector's dream. Even the standard edition is special (with a 20-page booklet so exquisitely designed); one cannot go wrong with any edition they choose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRVEMKS7RI49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161NOHMG#wasThisHelpful","R3RRVEMKS7RI49","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"She is - more than often - called a self-centered pop diva, but noone can accuse Mariah Carey for being silly when it comes to business. Using the lyrics of her 1994 Christmas classic ""All I want for Christmas is you"", this same-titled book is her first attempt as a writer, telling the story of a little girl dreaming of a puppy for Christmas. The idea is as cute as it sounds; and it is executed just as successfully, too. Chances are, adults and children alike are already familiar with the lyrics of the song. The interest comes from the story told by the illustrations (by Colleen Madden), which present the little girl as a cartoon version of Mariah (similar to that used in her ""Heartbreaker"" video). The story follows the little girl throughout the holiday season, in all her festive activities (baking, skating, shopping, visiting friends and family etc). Though it can be a little tedious to read those over-familiar to many lyrics, combined with the beautiful illustrations that do most of the work of telling the story, it all works rather splendidly!One of my favorite spreads shows the little girl, well, little Mariah, while all the other children are making snowmen, she is making a dog out of snow, complete with pine cone ears. Cuteness overload. (For MC fans who remember Jack, her adorable Jack Russell Terrier, this can bring some extra appreciation of this image). What is among the book's greatest qualities, is the multi-ethnic cast of characters; all children's books should feature this, and so I was more than pleased to see Mariah not missing the opportunity to portray a positive message. The quality of presentation is fantastic, with the glossy paper, and the hardback cover, and makes this 32-page book worth the purchase. Seems to me that, apart from the song itself (officially the biggest-selling Christmas song ever - 14+ million copies sold), ""All I want for Christmas is you"", the book, looks set to become another beloved tradition. With the ever popular, 15 million-selling ""Merry Christmas"" album turning 21 years old this month (watch out for the gorgeous deluxe anniversary red vinyl edition), Mariah may rightfully be considered as a modern Christmas Queen!Merry Christmas, everyone, 'tis the season to be jolly!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DR4ST8P3ZYOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399551395#wasThisHelpful","R3DR4ST8P3ZYOM","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Too young to know them during their heyday, I have come to know and appreciate Erasure and their music in the mid '90s, but I understand that they were undeniably an important part of the cultural fabric of the '80s UK society. Though less controversial than some of their peers, they also pushed boundaries and broke taboos, creating excitement like few other bands before or after them, while producing some fantastic music along the way. Bought this new 30th anniversary release with no hesitation, as I already own previous greatest-hits compilations, ""Pop! 20"", and ""Pop! 40"". Which is why I find ""Always"" not their most comprehensive collection to date, since, of their 13 studio proper albums, 3 do not provide any songs on here (""Cowboy"", ""Loveboat"", and ""Light at the end of the world""), and another 5 are only represented by 1 single each. For a release that celebrates the duo's 30 years in music, this should feature tracks off every record, regardless of how successsful or not these may be.At least, as far as the song selection is concerned, this 19-track (+1 remix) retrospective is great, featuring almost all the big hits, and flows rather smoothly, not always the case with singles which are chronologically listed as on here. What is more interesting about this set, is the remixes. Cannot quite understand why this could not be a 2-disc set (hits+remixes), but, even though 2 discs of remixes may seem too much or unnecessary, it is anything but. In fact, these different takes on the originals offer a most interesting alternative listen, representative of Erasure's extensive fusion of synth-pop, electro-dance. The beautiful hardbook packaging compliments the content, including a 20-page booklet with new - highly amusing - sleeve notes. Had this edition also included a DVD with their videos, then it would have been almost perfect. Still, ""Always"" presents a large piece of the band's body of work, and makes for a near seamlessly enjoyable experience altogether.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVUYTC28DLK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015398DAG#wasThisHelpful","R2IVUYTC28DLK7","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Featuring his collaborations with Disclosure [""Latch (2012), ""Omen"" (2015), and Naughty Boy [""La la la"" (2012)], and of course his solo singles (""Lay me down"", ""Money on my mind"", ""Stay with me"", ""I'm not the only one"", ""Like I can""), this new edition of one of 2014-2015's best-selling albums is a sort of mini greatest-hits album. Adding an extra disc of previously japanese-only bonus tracks, brand new cuts, acoustic versions and new collaborations, plus one magnificent cover of Amy Winehouse's ""Love is a losing game"", this edition is perfect for first-time buyers (like myself, who thought I'd wait some more before getting this), who will enjoy this in all its glory. Buyers of the original set are going to feel cheated by this enhanced version, but nevertheless this is a fine pop-soul record, crafted as if it was destined to become a classic album. Sam Smith may be the most plain name, but this offering is anything but. So heartbreakingly melancholic, yet, so addictive. Even the new atmospheric cover photo is more fitting to these songs, compared to that of the standard release. If only it included his 2014 ""Have yourself a Merry little Christmas"" cover, and the new Bond theme, then it would be absoluterly awesome. Still, it's a perfect little thing, and most probably will sell a lot (well, Adele's ""25"" is on the way so...).

"Anastacia's first greatest-hits album, the fantastic ""Pieces of a dream"" (2005), although released just 5 years into her career, boasted an impressive number of hits for such a short recording period. This updated version comes exactly 10 years later, offering a couple more hits, plus 2 brand new tracks. Truth is, following her first retrospective release, this talented little lady (5' 2"") with the big voice (a mezzo-soprano) has been dealing with serious health issues, but it's also a fact that none of her 3 subsequent albums managed to come close to the huge success of her first 3. So, 6 studio albums, and 24 singles later, the ""Ultimate edition"" comes as a reminder of why Anastacia has been dubbed the Queen of sprock. 14 out of 17 tracks from the first best-of are on here [no ""Made for lovin' you""(4th single off her debut album), ""In your eyes"" and ""Pieces of a dream"" (new tracks on ""POAD"")], with 5 more added on [""Stupid little things"" (from ""Resurrection""), ""Best of you"" (from ""It's a man's world""), ""Love is a crime"" (from ""Chicago OST""), and ""Army of me"" and ""Take this chance"" (both brand new)]. Once again, ""Boom"", the Official 2002 FIFA World Cup anthem, is omitted, and singles from 2008's ""Heavy rotation"" (2008) are excluded (Anastacia has admitted to regretting the forced change in direction on that album, so, it's justifiable). Those of us who have her first greatest-hits will be torn, those who haven't got them need no further thinking about buying this. It's a nice little package, complete with a booklet with photos and lyrics, but there isn't an extra incentive to make this an essential purchase. To be totally honest, ""Pieces of a dream"" overall is more desirable than this, but the 2 new tracks on here are worth buying. Well, just to support her, because she deserves it, if thinking of buying, choose this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27782CAZCSGSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129YBRA6#wasThisHelpful","R27782CAZCSGSV","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original version of ""1"" was released on November 13th, 2000, issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up. The Beatles' first singles compilation available on a single disc, it debuted at No. 1 in its first week in both the official UK and US album charts, and topped the charts in 35 countries around the world. It went on to become the best-selling album of that year, and the best-selling album of the decade worldwide, selling 31+ million copies. 15 years later, this epic collection gets refreshed, just in time for the holiday season. Repeating the exact same tracklist, it features every No. 1 single released in the UK and US from 1962 to 1970, with a bonus disc of 27 promo videos, which is really the attraction on this deluxe package.The song selection is nothing less than extraordinary, representing appropriately each of the band's different styles and phases: Merseybeat style (1962-1964, tracks 1-8), folk-rock (1965-1966, tracks 9-16), experimental-psychedelic (1967-1968, tracks 17-21), and back to basics-rock (1969-1970, tracks 22-27). The sound quality of the songs is, without a doubt, the very best to date. Remixed from the original multi-track masters, compared to the 2000 original release, the audio is sharper, crispier, crystal-clear, truly an audiophile's dream come true. In addition to these new stereo mixes, this blu-ray version, also, features surround sound 5.1 mixes presented as Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio (Dolby Digital and DTS in the DVD version).The video presentation is eye-popping. When someone of my generation gets to see old footage restored and enhanced to such level, then it's apparent that technology has reached inconceivable heights. The video disc alone is reason enough to buy this set. Presented in a classy, DVD-sized, gatefold digipack, and including a lavish and informative booklet (which has been given a poppier mini face-lift), ""1"" deluxe is one complete package. What sets this particular collection apart from others, is that it spans The Beatles' entire recording career. If there has been any singles album that shows the true genius of The Beatles, on any level, then it is definitely ""1"". Not a greatest hits collection, but it totally stands like one, being a comprehensive compilation.So many artists, current and past, have called The Beatles a major influence. One listen to ""1"", and anyone can realize why. The Beatles redefined music in their own image, and established a legacy no band will ever equal. They became the greatest band the world will ever know. There aren't many artists that can boast 27 No. 1 hits (I can only think of Mariah Carey's ""1s to infinity"" with 17 No. 1s coming close). It's really occasions like this when an item makes one comprehend the value and significance of certain things, which are beyond rating. So many words can be used to describe this (aptly-titled) collection; monumental, stellar, pristine, and essential, are some of the the most-appropriate.List of variations of ""Beatles 1/1+"":- standard CD- CD+DVD- CD+blu-ray- CD+2DVD*- CD+2blu-ray** These editions come with an additional 23 videos on disc 2, including alternate versions, as well as rarely seen and newly restored films and videos. The double-disc video editions, also, feature a 124-page hard-bound book with illustrations. The DVD and blu-ray video editions are, also, available as stand-alone packages.Here, I've listed the songs included on ""1"", along with the release dates, and chart placings.01.

"For those who were around back in the day, over the years ""Jagged little pill"" has gained some sort of iconic status, as one of that decade's most seminal albums, and arguably the most celebrated angst-ridden album of recent times. Quite deservingly so, because this 13-track set proved to be a landmark for the '90s generation, who crowned Alanis Morissette as the voice of an era, who explored and expressed the emotional wreckage of youth and femininity in such an arresting manner, that her personal experiences became universal, rendering this album a contemporary classic. To celebrate the 20 years since its first release, this new, limited to 30,000 copies worldwide, 4-disc set seems like an essential purchase, being a spectacular package that further enhances the appeal of the original record.CD 1 features the original album, newly remastered, overseen by Glen Ballard, producer and co-writer of ""Pill"". CD 2 contains 10 previously unreleased demos, that are either cut material in consideration for the record, or songs written after its release, all recorded between 1994-1998 (none of these are demos of songs from the album). This is the one of the most interesting aspects of this anniversary edition, as some of these tracks are pretty great, and could have been potential album tracks. It is historically significant, too, as on here is also included the first song Morissette co-wrote with Glen Ballard, the album producer, allegedly within an hour of their first meeting back in 1994 (""The bottom line""). CD 3 contains the acoustic re-recording of ""Pill"", released in 2005 to celebrate the album's 10th anniversary.The set concludes with a previously unreleased, full live set from the Jagged Little Pill Tour, recorded in London at Subterranea, on 28 September 1995, on CD 4. Representative of AM's powerful and fragile performances, the set showcases her charismatic presence to the full. In addition to selecting music for the set, Morissette provides never-before-seen photos and other ephemera from the time, from hew own personal collection. She also contributes a fascinating new essay, reflecting back on this time in her life, along with stories behind the demos included on CD 2. Any fan of the album will absolutely love this, it is so insightful, enlightening, and revealing. And if you love Alanis as a personality, you'll admire how incredibly eloquent she is, as naturally expected.As a longtime fan of Alanis' music, these songs sound so familiar, bringing memories from a special time in my life, still sounding engaging, even 2 decades on. Listening to ""Forgiven"", for example, still makes me wish that it was graced with a video, although at the same time I'm enjoying it more as the hidden gem that it is. I can only find a fault in this excellent package. I wish this set was rounded out by an extra disc of B-Sides, to make this a fully comprehensive anniversary release. Other than that, everything about it is near perfect; the original songs, the bonus tracks, the brilliant remastering, the classy presentation and design of the set, the artwork (how great is this new version of the old cover?), the liner notes. ""Jagged little pill: Collector’s edition"" is the definitive edition of this inspired, inspirational and intellectual piece of work.Jagged little facts:- The album garnered great critical acclaim upon release, praising its thematic content, as well as Morissette's raw and arresting delivery- It was released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records, which, according to her manager, Scott Welch, was the only label of all they had approached that did not pass on Morissette- ""Jagged little pill"" was Morissette's first album released internationally. It produced 6 hit singles, and topped the albums charts in 10 countries- Among its most prestigious accolades are 4 Grammy Awards, and 6 Juno Awards, awarded in 1996. It won a few more of both in the following year, too- Due to the success of the album, Morissette toured worldwide for a total of 18 months. The video ""Jagged little pill-Live"", which chronicles the bulk of the tour, also won a Grammy Award for ""Best Long Form Music Video""- In 1996, it was the best-selling album worldwide, with 18.7 million copies sold, with 500,000 or more copies sold during more than 15 non-consecutive weeks. To date, global sales exceed 33 million- It is the 4th best-selling album in Australian history, with 1+ million sales, certified 14 Platinum- The album peaked at No. 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, helding the top spot for 24 weeks, and selling over 2 million copies, certified 2× Diamond- The album topped the UK Official Albums Charts, and stayed in the charts for a total of 145 weeks, shipping more than 3 million copies, certified 10× Platinum- It was No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 for 13 non-consecutive weeks, and certified 16× Platinum in the US for shipments of 16 million copies, and sales of 15 million copies","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1588UXNTUDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145TOH4G#wasThisHelpful","R2O1588UXNTUDO","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of their first studio albums, ""East/West"" is A-ha's most diverse and daring set. A departure from their old radio-friendly sound to a moodier tone, it relied less on electronic beats and synthesizers, and used real instruments, updating the band's sound to appeal to the new decade's listeners. After the poptastic brilliance of their debut, ""Hunting high and low"", and the uneven and disjointed third album, ""Stay on these roads"", for this, A-ha made a conscious decision to present a different kind of songwriting, completing the transition suggested by their sophomore, the exquisitely dark ""Scoundrel days"". Showcasing a more mature side of them, they succeeded in delivering an album of sophistication and substance without sacrificing their artistic bent. Named after a Norwegian fairy tale, ""East/West"", although it alienated some at the time, it was a step in a different direction, and one of the band's artistic peaks.This new 2CD+DVD deluxe edition features the original album, an extra disc of early versions and demos, and a 10-track live set from NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corp), plus a DVD of ""Live in South America"", first released on VHS in 1993, and made available here for the first time. With so much ""new"" old material this year, any A-ha fan must be feeling like a kid in a candy store, I know I am! If there's one thing that slightly bothers me, is the A-ha logo on the album cover; it always looked so out of place, this was a great opportunity to change it. Plus, I always thought that the artwork and design of the album should all be black and white. But that's me being too fussy, I guess. This is a gorgeous new edition, absolutely worth getting.Note: The other 2 deluxe editions (""Stay on these roads"", and ""Memorial Beach"") are also brilliant. Excluding the back-to-front booklet hiccup of ""SOTR"", everything I've watched and listened to, is of excellent quality and beautifully presented.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQQXCU5EHEIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01648UF2O#wasThisHelpful","R2CQQXCU5EHEIN","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to classic festive albums, Mariah Carey's 1994 ""Merry Christmas"" is surely one of the first that come to mind. There you have a wonderful collection of festive classics as well as some new cuts, beautifully executed and presented in new old-fashioned style, with Mariah's gorgeous voice proving to be the perfect instrument for those trademark ballads she is best loved for, as well as for traditional numbers. ""All I want for Christmas is you"" is a true Christmas classic, arguably one of the most Christmas-associated festive songs ever. But, ""O Holy Night"", is also spectacular, just like her fittingly subdued version of ""Silent Night"", and the melancholic ""Miss you most (At Christmas time)"". Many artists have subsequently presented festive albums, however, Mariah's cheerful, jolly, a little melancholic too, poppy vibe is a guaranteed winner.21 years on, this classic Christmas collection, gets a deluxe vinyl treatment. I'm not a vinyl collector, but I had to get this, being my most favourite Christmas album of all (I have purchased tens of copies through the years, for myself and for gifts, in various editions and formats). Now with the red vinyl (which looks fantastic), this edition replicates the CD album design, featuring the most tasteful and joyous artwork ever, making this deluxe edition a beautifully assembled package inside-out, really the best music Christmas gift one could make. Only complaint, I just wish this new edition featured some extra songs, or memorabilia; sadly, there is no dowload card included either. But that's not to make anyone think twice about buying. In fact, I'm going to order a few more copies for this year's gifts! Merry Christmas, everyone, 'tis the season to be jolly!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D549NPJKWYDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014882NMC#wasThisHelpful","R2D549NPJKWYDG","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First all-new studio offering since 2012, and after giving birth to a baby boy just recently, ""Storyteller"" finds CU at her most experimental. Along with her steady collaborator Mark Bright, and with 2 new producers, who help push her into new sonic realms, on here she's exploring soul, southern-rock, R'n'B, and pop, pushing the boundaries unlike ever before, but retaining the country feel that is always the most distinctive feature in her music. With hardly a weak track, this is arguably Underwood's strongest record. Whether it's upbeat tracks such as opener ""Renegade runaway"", the sassy ""Dirty laundry"", and the rocky ""Church bells"", 3 fine examples of tour de force storytelling. Or midtempos such as the Sam Hunt-assisted ""Heartbeat"", ""Like I'll never love you again"", one of the most glorious love songs in her catalogue, ""The girl you think I am"", an almost acoustic, guitar and piano track, dedicated to her father, and the closing ""What I never knew I always wanted"", a tribute to her newborn baby.And more varied tracks like the poppier ""Chaser"", and ""Clock don't stop"", or ""Choctaw County affair"", a bluesy, gospel-tinged narrative about a murder trial, and ""Relapse"", an addiction-related song whose slow verses build up to a soaring chorus. Quite literally, the album feels like the musical equivalent of storytime. Lyrically fleshed-out with great effect, musically innovative, incorporating influences from a variety of genres, and exhibiting her most evocative vocals so far, ""Storyteller"" has all that requires to become a classic in its genre. Regardless of claims that CU is not country enough, her voice and stories have always been rooted in country tradition. This record shows how she has evolved since her American Idol days, while still remaining true to her country spirit. Some might need to take notice. In my review of her greatest-hits album last year, I said that there's something very likeable about Carrie Underwood, and her music. With this new album, I appreciate her even more as an artist, and like her even more as a person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZO98886UEF0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141GTKNG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZO98886UEF0C","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous, collector's edition 24CD singles box set that collates the singles originally released on Geffen and Atlantic Records, from across Donna Summer's international releases, presented in replica mini-sleeves, accompanied by a very fancy mini-book, with photos, liner notes, and interviews with collaborators of DS, and with the lady herself. Also included is a bonus 4-track CD featuring remixes, not previously available commercially. It is a cool-looking box set (it looks even more awesome in reality), the remastering is fantastic (judging by the songs I listened to), and it shows that the team behind it made an effort to present something special. With singles less known and popular, and way too many repeated songs as different versions (obviously in an attempt to preserve authenticity), the box does not claim to be a complete singles box set. As long as anyone does not mind the omission of most of DS' early and late ""hot stuff"", it is worth having. As a casual fan of DS's music, I wish it contained all singles from ""The hostage"" (1974) right up to ""Stamp your feet"" (2008), it just seems weird to have a singles set without all the defining and essential hits included. I love the look of the box, and at a better price I might be tempted to get it; it's a case of wanting to have it, rather than listen to it. This is basically repeating what is already available on the recent expanded reissues. So, until a thorough and comprehensive singles box set appears, as befitting the Queen of Disco, I'd rather stick to treating myself to those.Note: There is, also, a 30-minute interview on CD15, which I find to be a nice addition to the box set. (Can't think of any other box ever including an interview on disc - not even the most spectacular of all, Bananarama's ""In a bunch"" - her fans will treasure this! By the way, from the way she talks, I'm guessing Donna Summer must have been a special lady.)5***** for what it is3*** for comprehensiveness","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GAIWTI0VLGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WAZ9AK#wasThisHelpful","R21GAIWTI0VLGE","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Kendrick Lamar's ""To pimp a butterfly"", and Dr. Dre's ""Compton"", already sending fire towards all directions, there's no better time for The Game to ride that West wave. Sequel to his heralded 2005 debut album, ""The Documentary 2 & 2.5"" arrive as a sort of comeback albums, following 2011's ""The R.E.D. album"", 2012's ""Jesus piece"", and last year's ""Blood moon: Year of the Wolf"" compilation. Listening to this mammoth set, makes me wonder why he chose to release it in 2 instalments, only a week apart one from the other. Anyway, what's important is the music; and this sh*t is great. Stepping away from the distractions that have plagued his past works, Game delivers again the uncut rawness that made him stand out in the first place. Lyrically, he has a renewed focus, telling his story with more detail and meaning than ever. Sonically, both albums sway from classic old-school hip-hop beats to new-soul gangsta grooves, assisted by the elite team of producers he's convened. He's a master collaborator, and on this album he excells on that with the endless list of features.It's a shame that noone taught him the word ""economy"". With 37 tracks in total (19, and 18, respectively), and with each set clocking at 70+ minutes, his facial hair isn't the only thing in need of a trim. In fact, length is the only flaw on here. Thankfully, there are redeeming qualities even in the weak tracks. If we say that ""TD2"" is the album his label wanted to make, and ""TD2.5"" the album The Game wanted to make, the balance between them makes them both essential. Overall, it's mostly great stuff, and Game is making one of the most impressive reinventions by a rapper in recent memory. The fact that he's around like this 10 years later leaves the impression that he's been waiting for certain pieces to fall into place in order to make a worthy ""Documentary"" sequel. Only time will tell if this will go down as his best work (for me these 2 sets combined surpass his masterful ""Doctor's advocate"" record). Regardless, ""The Documentary 2 & 2.5"" are massive achievements. They may not win him new fans, but will certainly please those who've been listening and celebrating his past catalogue.Note: It ain't the classic it could have been, but it's almost there. I just can't help but wish that he took the best songs from both records, and made one dope ass album. Still, 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYLWTRBC4DN95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NLSFC0#wasThisHelpful","RYLWTRBC4DN95","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First release of Sony's new Supreme Cinema Series, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" gets to see its second transfer in blu-ray. What is interesting about this is the rather unusual packaging. What is more intriguing, though, is the brand new transfer itself, considering how controversial the prior blu-ray transfer was. Those who expect nothing but perfection, will be thrilled to see just that. 1992 is not so long ago, but try to show the movie to someone who doesn't know about it, they will think that it was filmed just recently, it is that awesome! Being a huge fan of the film, I have both the UK standard and collector's blu-ray editions of this. This is by far superior to both, with improved, sharper images (the shadow depth and detail are incredible), a more balanced colour scheme, and phenomenal audio. Some of the new bonus features on this is all-new interviews with Francis Ford Copola, commentaries, theatrical trailers, making-ofs, and extended deleted scenes. I find very cool that the old Criterion Collection LaserDisc commentary track has been included. If only they did the same with the one vintage extra that seems to have gotten lost (HBO's ""Making of"" documentary from the Columbia special edition LaserDisc - cannot track this anywhere). Presented as a digibook, with a glossy 24-page booklet, with clear plastic case covers binded as in a book, with the disc inside a slot at the back, and with a beautiful blood-dripping detail embossed onto the actual binding, it sounds nicer than it actually looks. Rather flimsy presentation overall, which does not justify the ""limited edition"" description. The package, also, includes a digital code.  Recommended to all fans of ""Dracula"", or to anyone who hasn't seen it before and are buying it for the very first time, this is the definitive version of this spectacular movie, slightly let down by the somewhat disappointing packaging.Audio:English: Dolby Atmos, English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit), French: Dolby Digital 5.1 (448 kbps), Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1 (448 kbps)Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Turkish5***** for the content4**** for this edition","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZJ59STACXBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012RC81MC#wasThisHelpful","R3SZJ59STACXBR","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blessed be the powers that brought ""together again"" quite possibly the best R'n'B music team ever; producers-extraordinaires Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, and their muse, Janet (""Miss Jackson, if you're nasty!""). There is not a fan of this trio who will not admit that the best work of them comes when all working together. Whenever these 3 work exclusively as a team, they create magic every single time, and each of Janet's previous albums is undeniable proof of this (those who disagree, keep your ""Damita Jo""s and ""20Y.O.""s - ""Discipline"" is an exception, though JJ&TL-free, it was terrific). Producer Jimmy Jam speaking to EW about this new album said: ""I think it's totally different from any of her other albums. But it feels like her. The thing about this album is there's a lot of different places that it touches, but at the end of the day, it's pure Janet.""As much apprehensive as I was about this statement (don't most artists say that about their music?), listening to this new JJ album makes me think that he could not have been more accurate. Because that is what ""Unbreakable"" essentially is; a pure Janet record. Boasting a modernized version of the duo's trademark sound, combined with Janet's positive and spirited presence, it feels like a mix-and-match of the trio's past records, and then some. All the elements that made her who she is, they're all here. Bouncy, melodic, carefree, introspective, fragile, empowering, sassy, and classy, Janet is right at the centre of the album, exploring a range of music styles, presenting her most diverse set since her superb 1997 opus, ""The velvet rope"". This time around, however, she has not come back to challenge listeners or her pop students.Instead, she plays a more benign role. Gone are the those unabashed carnal delights of past albums; no sexual references, teasing innuendos, and whispered ""oohs"" and ""coos"" on this. Even the sultry first single, ""No sleep"", is more reticent than explicit. The word ""sex"" does not appear in the album's lyrics at all, ain't that shocking! The album is full of Janet goodies to relish. ""BURNITUP!"" is impossible to listen and resist grooving along to it; ""After you fall"" is too honest to avoid getting caught up in its sweet melancholy; ""Broken hearts heal"" is as comforting as a song can get, a song dedicated to her beloved brother Michael, the King of Pop. Speaking of whom, don't be fooled by ""The great forever"", it's not him singing! These 4 are key tracks, not necessarily the best of the bunch (they are among them, though), but the most representative of the album.On ""Control"", Janet was groovy; on ""Rhythm nation 1814"", thought-provoking; on ""janet."", independent; on ""The velvet rope"", angry; on ""All for you"", bubbly; on ""Damita Jo"", sexy; on ""20Y.O."", relaxed; on ""Discipline"", commanding. On the new album, she is loving. Overwhelmed by its brilliance, I would say that ""Unbreakable"" is a glorious comeback, equalling that of her rival Madonna and her mighty ""Rebel heart"". For all intents and purposes, ""Unbreakable"" is Janet's I'm-back-though-I-never-really-left album. Having worked closely like they did in the past, this trio's chemistry has resulted in a concentrated record with a solid structure that positions Janet right at its centre, as an artist, singer/songwriter with always something to say. Regardless of how relevant Janet currently is, or how successful it will be, ""Unbreakable"" adds to her already rich musical legacy and, if there is any justice, it should sweep her into new heights, proving that she is unbreakable, indeed...5, 4, 3, 2, 1, edit!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEQHQK3T0TVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DL1AVO#wasThisHelpful","R1DEQHQK3T0TVN","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1995: I remember grabbing the CD of this on the spot, as soon as the pink feathers and the word ""garbage"" on the cover caught my eye at a local record store in the UK, and could not believe my ears as I realized I had just discovered my new favourite super-band! Few months later they were all over the place, and by next year they'd hit it really big. 2015: digital copy pre-ordered. Maybe not quite as desirable as the physical release, but loyalty to the music nonetheless. Frustrated that the super deluxe edition of this is only available as a download, I'd rather have all tracks in digital copies, than not at all. Ironic that I should pay for music in a format that is slowly killing off CDs and vinyl. Plus, how weird to obtain music that, as a music collector, cannot actually ""collect"", since it's stored on a hard drive instead of a shelf.At 62 tracks, the running time would make this a 4-disc set, which would have made an excellent deluxe CD set, but one that may have been a little pricier than all but the most die-hard fans would like to pay. I suspect Garbage would not sell thousands of 4-disc packages at this point, so keeping it digital-only for the fans makes some sense. With 6 options to choose from (see below), one would've thought that at least one of these would include both physical and digital material in one package, but no. Annoying as this already was, it actually became even more for buyers of the digital super deluxe edition. Available originally at only £7.99 from most EU retailers (well, e-tailers in this case), just 2 days before release amazon e-mailed customers, apologizing for not being able to deliver the pre-ordered MP3 album.The result was them cancelling pre-orders or re-directing to a link, which took you to a copy of the standard 21-track digital download, and for double the price. Customer service can issue a refund, as it turns out, so the price for the 62-track bundle is actually £7.99 and not the inflated £15.98, but why all this hassle? Even the physical copy of this anniversary edition is causing frustration. With regard to the 2LP vinyl, it is still not clear at present whether the pink-coloured vinyl is limited or exclusive to one region. In my country (Greece), we get the standard black vinyl (I checked with 3 different retailers). I would love to get my hands on those pinkies, they look fantastic on the promo photos! So, feel free to post any info as to where one can get this set.Listening to the digital version of the album that made me a fan 20 years ago, makes me realize how dramatically things have changed since Garbage introduced themselves with this flashy self-titled debut. What remains the same, though, is the impact of this genre-defying set, which feels just as instrumental for post-grunge, as it does for trip-hop music. Younger audiences are probably unaware of this band's contribution to alternative rock, but it was this very record that bridged different worlds, and drew different audiences together under Garbage's unique banner. Calling them the forbears of alternative rock is only fitting. All it takes is a random listen to any of the songs on this, from the opening ""Supervixen"" to the closing ""Milk"". As for the G-Sides, they're only indicative of the band's legacy.

"A collector's edition of Queen's 15 albums, pressed on heavyweight 180gram coloured vinyl LPs, plus an 12""x12"" 108-page illustrated hardback book, presented in a lavish box set, this is a truly spectacular item in every aspect. Upon reading the news for its release a few months ago, I was tempted to place an order, but held back because of the high price. What convinced me to do it was a promo picture, showing the albums with their accompanying coloured vinyls. All LPs can be purchased individually, but they will be black; the coloured vinyls are exclusive only to this set, so that makes this box more special. ""Queen II"", ""Innuendo"" and ""Made in Heaven"" are pressed as a 2LP sets (the first in black vinyl for side 'black' and white vinyl for side 'white'; each with custom etching on flip side). Each LP comes with an inner-sleeve, some are gatefolds, all recreating the original LP releases. The artwork is amazing, it has to be seen and felt, the team behind it did a fine job and it shows; the design (die-cuts, different types of paper), the textures (glossy, matte finish), the colours; the quality is just unbelievable.The book is a little treasure. Featuring introductions to each album, commentary from the band, hand-written lyrics, rare photographs, discography and videography info, it is an excellent companion to the music. All these are housed in a sturdy, stylish flip-top box with a slip-case protective cover, with the Queen logo embossed. But it is the audio quality that really counts on collections as extensive as this. Judging from what I have listened to so far, the sound is tremendous. The vinyls play dead quiet, the clarity and detail is impressive, the dynamics beautifully balanced; these are not digitally sourced vinyls, the warmth from the master tapes is right there, headphones never lie! A download code for the complete music featured on here is included, too. Overall, the box set is nothing short of brilliant, concept and execution-wise, no detail is spared. Artistic value should be the main incentive when it comes to purchasing music, but this is a pristine package, a real Queen gem. There have been many reissues, repackages, box sets, anniversary editions etc released this year, but this has to be the top vinyl rerelease of 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30UH619TSSMDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DEQUBA#wasThisHelpful","R30UH619TSSMDK","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If the publicity garnered for an album is indicative of an artist's relevance and success, then The Weeknd will soon become a household name, and ""Beauty behind the madness"" will be huge. Evidently it is not only his most accessible set so far, but also a compelling crossover album. Sonically, it is a bigger departure from his older work than most would have liked for it to be. The Weeknd, not the same self-destructive, depressed 20 year-old anymore, but now in a better place, is true to himself and consistent still; the material is still raw and honest, the production is always on point, the lyrics are still dark and cynical, the delivery mesmerising and haunting as ever. Real artists are supposed not to ever sit stagnant. No legendary artist made music that sounded the same. With so many references to his previous work, this is hardly the watered-down generic pop album all those negative comments over the internet are speculating. The Weeknd has all it takes to become a contemporary megastar, so he is experimenting, expanding, opening himself to a new demographic, trying to become monumental. It is all about progress. In fact, with this very record he gives traditional pop a foundational makeover, one that has not happened since the times of Prince and Michael Jackson. The sound is radically different; but the message has not changed, only the way it is delivered. Still suicidal, sassy, sensual and scandalous, always seductive and startling.

"""Runaway horses"" (1989) arrived 2 years after Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven on earth"" breakthrough. Although it maintained her popularity, it did not reach that album's commercial peak. Apparently, there were disagreements regarding promotional tactics. It did not help either that US so-called music experts snubbed it at the time. Still, ""Horses"" sold very well worldwide, reaching gold, platinum and double platinum status in many markets. It spawned 6 hit singles (arguably all 10 songs could have been released as singles), an impressive accomplishment on its own, even more so considering the circumstances. The pop brilliance encountered on this record is unparalleled, that is why it is considered to be Belinda's magnum opus, a bona-fide record, a pop landmark; it is indeed all of the above. Her personal favourite song is included here (""Summer rain""), mine, too (""Vision of you""), though special mention has to be made for the gorgeous flamenco-flavoured ""La luna"", and the sublime rocking ""Leave a light on"". 1989 was a great year for pop music, ""Runaway horses"" is one of the reasons. Hop on and enjoy the ride!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9N4Z257WDA1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY5Y37U#wasThisHelpful","R9N4Z257WDA1X","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Live your life be free"" (1991), Belinda Carlisle's 4th solo album, found her in the midst of a severe drug problem. Interestingly, and ironically enough, this set of songs is the most optimistic and carefree of her career; plus, she looks at her absolute best on videos and photo shoots from that era (the unforgettable ""Do you feel like I feel"" video is simply iconic). Full of catchy choruses, and addictive melodies, the album is utterly poptastic, perhaps more than any other BC record. Considering the cancellation of the promo tour due to her pregnancy, it faired pretty well, despite Belinda claiming later on that this is her least favorite record. Obviously this has to do with the fact that she was not pleased with how her label was handling her music at the time. But with so many brilliantly crafted pop gems one after another, ""LYLBF"" is one of her all-time best, a close second to ""Runaway horses"". ""Half the world"" is the ultimate highlight on this set, but make sure you also listen to ""You're nothing without me"", ""Emotional highway"" and the superb cancelled single ""I plead insanity"". And take notice of the great statement the anthemic title track makes, thanks for that Belinda!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTZULD59J2GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I3PH7K#wasThisHelpful","R2OTZULD59J2GT","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More guitar-based and raw, ""Real"" (1993), Belinda Carlisle's 5th studio offering, is a departure from the perfectly polished pop of previous albums. Affected by motherhood, Belinda consciously chose to change direction with this, presenting a more personal and mature set of songs, which lacked the immediate, broad commercial appeal of past albums. A change in her image is obvious, too, hardly wearing any make-up on the stark cover and inside photos, as if trying to strip altogether (hmmm, please do!). Contributing to the overall sincerity is the fact that she co-wrote most of the songs, which also explains the intensity of her delivery. ""Lay down your arms"" and ""One with you"" are the record's instant grabbers, the rest of the album calls for repeated listenings before coming to appreciate it. ""Too much water"", and the almost religious ""Where love hides"", are also standouts, though more quiet, while the atmospheric ""Tell me"" should have been given a single release. Although it was hugely ignored, ""Real"" remains one of BC's most consistent and rewarding recordings. This is the real deal. Really.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PWBWBME6TIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY5Y39S#wasThisHelpful","R20PWBWBME6TIZ","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After briefly re-uniting with the Go-Go's, Belinda Carlisle returned to the recording studio, and resumed working. In 1996, she released her 6th solo album, ""A woman and a man"". Consisting of slick, finely-crafted, perfectly accessible songs, this is Belinda's most safe and balanced album. This was her gift to the faithful fans who stood by her through the years (thanks, our pleasure!). Showcasing an artist at her most confident and alluring state, on this album she shines vocally, exhibiting precision and emotion simultaneously. I fondly remember her tres-chic UK TV appearances for the promo of ""Always breaking my heart"", where she wore some lovely dresses with cherry prints on them, what a classy lady! The album included several hits, and revitalized her solo career in Europe. As a result of this success, it was released in the US, a year later, but with no much luck. Highlights are the exquisite title-track, the lush ""Love in they of C"", ""I won't say I'm in love"" from Disney's ""Hercules"", and the cover of Marianne Faithful's ""The ballad of Lucy Jordan"" (last 2 tracks are included on the CD+DVD edition).

"Following on from the gorgeous repackages of her 7 studio albums which brought back to life her hard-to-find or out-of-print albums, and breathed new life to those forgotten classics, 4 new retrospective releases [""The Collection"", ""The Anthology"", ""The very best of"" (all great), and ""The greatest"" (skippable)], 2 live sets [""Live from Metropolis"" (good), and ""Access all areas"" (better)], and a fine box set (""The complete studio albums""), Edsel now presents ""The CD singles 1986-2014"" box set, the final instalment in the Belinda Carlisle series. BC has had her entire discography remastered, repackaged and re-issued, but was among the few who were lucky to have been given some extra special treatment in it. All too often reissues are fragmentary, and one has to buy more than 1 disc just to have a certain song or remix that does not feature on a CD they already own, but hers were impressively comprehensive.Naturally, this box set is expected to be equally brilliant. Unfortunately - and rather surprisingly - this is an almost missed opportunity to present a superb collectible item. Although there was very little material that was not put on previous reissues, neither that nor much else is offered on here as an extra to entice potential buyers. With just a handful of songs released outside Belinda's recorded discography, it is even more frustrating that not all of it is featured on here as it should have. Once again ""I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you"" and ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" are not included. Also, no ""Dancing in the city"" (7"" single edit), no slow version of ""I won't say (I'm in love)"". Even the original ""I won't say... "" is not featured, which is odd as Disney had allowed Edsel to use it previously, but apparently refused to licence it for this. And ""I feel the magic""'s 7"" single version is absent once again...Which brings us to the box set's crowning jewel: if there was one reason for fans to rejoice, that would be the inclusion of the ever-missing BC track fans have been longing for, the mighty ""In my wildest dreams"". One would have hoped that after all these years the master tapes were finally traced, and thus the song is presented in all its glory on this special occasion. Well, the song makes its appearance on here in poor quality, almost making one suspicious of the source it was ripped from. Definitely a great addition, it is just evidently sonically below the level of the rest of the songs. I appreciate Edsel's good intention of including this hidden treasure, but perhaps it would be preferable to exclude it, instead of spoiling an otherwise excellent and thoughtful presentation, especially considering the high price of this (by the way, amazon also lists another edition of this, for $234, but there is only one pressing for this product, so it is basically the same item).On the plus side, has to be the splendid artwork which is meticulously replicated from the original singles covers, the informative 24-page booklet (wish it was longer and richer, though), and the box's simple but elegant sleeve design. I am pretty sure the price of this will very soon drop significantly, so do not rush to get it. I ordered mine from Belinda's official store, as I wanted a signed and numbered copy (it cost €105,85 + €15,93 shipping which is €121,78 - that is $130 in total), and I feel less cheated, but I wish the whole thing was perfect. All in all, this may not be the premium product it could have been (especially when compared to the other singles box set released this week in Europe, Bananarama's ""In a bunch: The singles 1981-1993"", which is truly and honestly beyond compare), but, aside from the ""In my wildest dreams"" dud, it matches up with the album re-issues and compilations.Tracklisting:CD 1.

"Not many would dare to follow their successful debut album by doing a complete turnaround on their sophomore, but not all artists are primarily concerned with commercial success. Natalie Imbruglia proved her artistic integrity by taking the pop-rock sound of ""Left of the middle"" more than a few steps further, by presenting a set of songs that almost felt like some kind of re-introduction to the world, complete with her new image. While maintaining her established pop appeal, the new songs (on all of which she shares a co-writing credit) were not directed in one way, but are a perfectly balanced mix of pop, rock, indie and electronic music, exhibiting NI's maturity and confidence in the best possible way. This diversity is more than obvious in the singles chosen off the album: ""That day"", an angst-ridden guitar ballad with a violin (!) bridge, an unexpected choice for first single, yet, a most striking one; ""Wrong impression"", a sunny, super-infectious pop ditty, the happiest NI has ever sounded; and ""Beauty on the fire"", a subtle/euphoric electronic midtempo, so elegant it almost hurts! Special mention for the haunting ""Do you love"", the most introspective song with the most universal appeal, simply amazing. But then again, most songs on here are brilliant, with beautiful melodies, thoughtful lyrics, robust choruses, strong vocals, fine production. Surely Natalie's finest moment, this is a great - and greatly underrated - album, just as gorgeous as the woman on its cover (and we are talking about possibly the only female popstar that has never used her blatant good looks for attention-seeking). Make sure you find your way to ""White lilies island"", it is one of those places/records you owe yourselves a visit/listen to...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16082ODM5VPCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00138D58C#wasThisHelpful","R16082ODM5VPCQ","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those bee-stung lips, those razor-sharp cheekbones, those ice-melting eyes, Natalie Imbruglia's fine beauty makes her one of the most gorgeous ladies in pop history (sigh). The fact that she may be the only female popstar that has never used her blatant sex-appeal for attention-seeking is probably one of the reasons she is so underrated, but is definitely to her credit. Looking at the album's ominous cover art - further proof of her moral integrity - showing her near-perfect face framed by a man's tattooed arms, it is most admirable how it juxtaposes female vulnerability and male power in such a simple way. No stranger to bringing a song out of obscurity and giving it mass appeal (as happened with her 1997 debut smash and signature hit, Ednaswap's ""Torn""), NI's first set of songs in 6 years comprises songs originally sung by her favourite male artists. Not the greatest idea for a comeback, but a welcome return nevertheless, ""Male"" fares reasonably well for a covers album.Mostly acoustic and stripped down, the production matches her smooth voice, delivering a pleasant set of songs. However, with just guitars and little else, things start to fall flat after the album's first and most engaging half. Sure there are some great tracks (delicate ""Cannonball"", bittersweet ""Goodbye in his eyes"", and arresting lead single ""Instant crush"" are standouts), but the safety in production and song selection make ""Male"" sound weak, ironically (especially when considering the bite of Tori Amos' 2001 ""Strange little girls"" album of female reinterpretations of male songs). This could have been a much more interesting and punchier project, had the songs been at least arranged with more diversity and flair. As much charming and beautiful as it is in parts, the record is neither overwhelming nor ambitious, overall. That, of course, matches with Natalie's low profile, but for her usual high standards ""Male"" is rather pale. Those who have her ""White lilies island"" album know what I mean...","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8C15UGFCR2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYM8FEM#wasThisHelpful","R2O8C15UGFCR2S","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether a fan of hers or not (I had only bought the ""Back to black"" album on the strength of its songs), this is a fascinating account of the rise and fall of one of UK's most iconic contemporary female singers, the talented but troubled Amy Winehouse, who may have left early, but left her bold mark on the world through her music. What is striking about her is not just the power of her singing, the depth of the lyrics, her ease in performing or what was hidden behind her caricature image. More than anything, it is the fragility of her character, as clearly Amy was a sensitive, almost delicate, person, burdened by the same insecurities we all live with. And, thus, it was somewhat inevitable that all of these would eventually crush beneath the weight of her addictions and unwanted celebrity. Ironically, the peak of her career was when she was singing about the darkest period in her life. On a revealing scene where she is recording one of her trademark songs, ""Back to black"", she appears so nonchalant about getting the track down, innocent and childlike, whistling off at the end like it was no big deal. Perhaps it was not, but that track turned out to be an epic. And that, in some sense, is a big deal. Really, what sad state of affairs comes to pass when one so young and gifted finds herself taken before her time. I wept, and I am not a fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWG6R1NDGJJKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UVG49Y#wasThisHelpful","RWG6R1NDGJJKX","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Incredible blu-ray transfer for this psychological thriller directed by Tarsem Singh, and starring Jennifer Lopez. Taking the theme of entering into the twisted mind of a serial killer - an exciting and demanding idea in itself - very seriously, ""The cell"" is a bold and extravagant portrayal of a visionary artist's concept. Blending many styles and genres, this is one of the first serial killer features to take the genre in a new direction. Tarsem allows himself to take liberties with reality and imagination, and puts his artistic rein to good use. He also shows an exceptional talent for storytelling. He leaves much to the imagination of the viewer as definite answers are not provided but instead suggested by the imagery he so skillfuly creates by drawing upon various works of art, producing a visually stunning movie, almost too heavy in spectacle. As overdrawn or forced, however, there is also thought-provoking as well as disturbing material to relish, preventing many from branding this a nonsense, superficial flick. Actually, ""The cell"" caters for everybody, offering sci-fi, horror, mystery, crime, drama, and art, all woven masterfully to create a captivating and fascinating cinematic experience, often unfairly dismissed as a JLo movie. Includes bonus features different to those previously available on the DVD.

All Warner did for this, is literally move the 7 bonus tracks from the 1997 reissue on an extra disc, and add 8 tracks. 7"" edits of ""Private dancer"", ""Let's stay together"", ""Better be good to me"", and ""Help"", the extended version of ""We don't need another hero"", as well its 7"" and 12"" instrumentals, the instrumental of ""Ball of confusion"", plus some more live B-Sides, are not included. Surely some demos are gathering dust in the vaults, but noone bothered to do some research in order to present some special material. The bonus tracks from the 1997 reissue could easily have been put on CD 1 (it fits, obviously), and thus more room would be available on CD 2 for the (now) missing tracks. Also, the omission of a DVD is inexcusable, no videos or tour material, what a serious letdown, giving no inspiration to a fan, let alone a purist like myself, to buy what could have been a complete and truly great 30th anniversary deluxe edition. Despite its many flaws, though, this newly remastered set does just about enough to justify the upgrade. The album itself is reason enough for anyone to purchase this, the digipack is nicely assembled, the extensive booklet is interesting, and the extra tracks are all very nice additions. It should also be noted that the new remastered vinyl LP comes with no bonus tracks.

"Robbie Williams is playing for the first time in my country today. So many great songs are expected to be heard, however, I wish he surprised tonight's audience with this, which to me is the epitome of Robbie-ness. Originally a double A-Side release in the summer of 2001, ""Eternity / The road to Mandalay"" was the final single release off Robbie's third solo album, the super-successful ""Sing when you're winning"", on which this is the closing track. ""Eternity"" was a fragile ballad that nicely complimented ""The road to Mandalay"", and went on to became quite popular. But it is this track that really stood the test of time among Robbie fans. Not a surprise, as it is one of his most brilliant songs. Some of his most melancholic lyrics over a cheerful melody (acoustic guitar and drums, building up to a subtle horn and trumpet crescendo, complete with ""pam, pam, pam pa ra ram, pam, pam""), delivered with a beautifully controlled voice, ""The road to Mandalay"" is not a pop ditty, but a perfectly camouflaged reflective anthem. Even the picture sleeve's artwork evokes an introspective, nostalgic feel, despite its vivid colours.

"The first album to be released on the band's custom label, and one of their most important during their long-running and much celebrated career, ""Sticky fingers"" sees the Rolling Stones in their creative prime, presenting them at their most low-key and introspective. Arguably one of their best and most tight sets, it is ironic that many of these tracks were recorded in different places, and at different times. From the bawdy ""Brown sugar"", and the mournful ""Wild horses"", down to the album's deeper cuts, this is quite rightly one of the most essential and iconic rock albums ever released. This brand new re-issue is equally precious in that it puts together more pieces of this classic album. Listening to the stripped-down version of ""Wild horses"" (with that fine lyric video on youtube) a couple of months ago, made me crave for more stuff like this, and this new edition does not disappoint. Obviously, it is the early versions and outtakes of these familiar songs on this set's second disc that make it pretty essential, along with the live tracks from the Roundhouse gig (""Midnight rambler"" is top, top material). A DVD with more goodies would have been nicer but hey. Beautifully remastered (this is old material, let us not forget), and gloriously presented (complete with a zipper!), all a fan has to do is unzip and enjoy! Sticky, dirty, raunchy and raw, this re-issue of ""Sticky fingers"" is totally worth savoring.Note: There seems to be an issue with vinyl copies arriving with big, greasy finger/hand prints all over them. For an item bearing such a name, sticky fingers takes a whole new - admittedly annoying - dimension!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRF8IWBKOX8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN9PP44#wasThisHelpful","RTRF8IWBKOX8O","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much belated but finally available, Seasons 1-9 of the super-fabulous SUPERNATURAL series, are housed in a glossy, sturdy slide-off box set, featuring all 195 episodes, plus special features. All seasons are 4-disc sets (except for Season 3 which, being the shortest, is spread over 3 discs), presented in double, not regular-sized, clear blue amaray cases. Each season contains all the episodes and special features from the separate blu-ray season releases (except for Easter eggs and some image galleries), and comes with an inside booklet listing credits and summaries. With Season 10 having just being released, this box set is much delayed, but it is absolutely worth buying, especially if you are missing previous seasons, or if you want to have them all together. The box set's run time is 8,205 minutes. This is a UK import, so the price is fantastic, considering that the european price is 75 (which is around $110). Besides, buying all seasons separately would cost twice as much. For a brand new item of such pristine quality in every aspect, this is superb deal. Winchester boys rule, enjoy!

"Following ""The Resistance"" (2009) and ""The 2nd Law"" (2012), which were pre-occupied with issues such as globalised control, and shrinking of natural resources, ""Drones"", is the final instalment of Muse's trilogy of concept albums. An album with deeper socio-political dimensions, dealing with issues of brainwashing, dehumanisation, supression of the truth, and conspiracy theories, it tells the story about how the system indoctrinates a soldier into remote-controlled warfare. It is easy to realize what Muse drummer Dom Howard meant, describing this album as ""back to basics"", since this is a more refined variant of the band's early sound, probably their most focused work since 2006's ""Black holes and revelations"", and surely the heaviest they have ever sounded. Mixing war imagery with rock is hardly a novel idea, but on ""Drones"" Muse make an adventurous and ambitious use of their penchant for electro-rock, offering a heavy yet accessible 53-minute set, inspired by moral quandaries surrounding drone technology, complete with samples and matching artwork, proof of their musical and artistic maturation. Although it lacks the insight and perspective of similar, more accomplished projects by legendary progressive rock bands, it is quite monumental in its own right, which is not a small feat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYHFCZJ2W08I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHQ73NO#wasThisHelpful","R2NYHFCZJ2W08I","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the glorious debut of ""Lungs"", the terrific follow-up of ""Ceremonials"", and their outstanding ""MTV Unplugged"", and following the 4 videos prior to its release, Florence + The Machine's new studio album seemed like a sure bet. After 3 days of repeated listening, I feel that, although it fails to meet the super high expectations suggested by its advanced publicity, it is another well-crafted set of songs, true to the spirit of its creator. Slightly overblown but, ironically, more intimate than before, the power of these songs leaves me wanting more and more. The biggest surprise on here is the subtle use of Welch's belting voice. I'd never thought such a wild instrument could be tamed, but it still sounds so wonderfully expressive. In fact, the album's quiet songs are the most engaging, with the serene and magnificent ""St Jude"" being the most unexpected standout track (a personal favourite - I was mesmerized as soon as I watched its stunning video back in March), and quite possibly the finest recording moment of the band. Deluxe edition is a beautiful casebook digipack, featuring a luxurious 36-page booklet with photos and credits, plus 5 (2 new and 3 demos) extra tracks, a nice presentation that adds to the album's appeal, one that truly lives up to its name.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROL8OIIL31WVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THEH4UY#wasThisHelpful","ROL8OIIL31WVX","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With so many Belinda Carlisle re-releases and greatest-hits albums since 2013, one would have thought that the absolute definitive BC collection is already out there. Actually it is. Well, almost. For those who wish to have most of her biggest hits on one album, the best choice is 2013's ""The Collection"", which is her ""official"" best-of, a nicely assembled CD+DVD package, a mini version of the 3CD+2DVD ""The Anthology"" (BC's most comprehensive career-spanning release, perfect for those interested to own a larger part of her catalogue, an item quite difficult to obtain due to its limited availability and high price). This new very-best-of serves as a pretty definitive 2-disc Belinda retrospective collection; and I say pretty because it omits her ""Belinda"" and ""A woman and an man"" albums (thus, no ""Mad about you"", ""In too deep"", ""Always breaking my heart"" etc). With a generous 34 tracks, and including the majority of her biggest singles, the tracklisting is nothing short of impressive. Covering her most successful era of late '80s and early '90s, next to 20 hit singles, are also included some album tracks that rank among her best (""You're nothing without me"", ""Emotional highway"", ""Where love hides"", ""One with you""). ""A prayer for everyone"" and ""All God's children"" off the ""A place on earth"" 1999 collection are on here, too, plus ""The air you breathe"", a B-Side which first appeared on the UK version of the ""Little black book"" single. And, to seal the deal, these 34 great songs can become yours for just $12! Belinda brilliance for everyone, including myself who could not miss out on this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46EV7QV7IV8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0VBJ3O#wasThisHelpful","R46EV7QV7IV8I","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Delivered a year after winning the Eurovision Song Contest, this is Conchita's baby, product of 300 song submissions, and a painful but beautiful creative process, as she has stated. Pop music is heavily suffering from dullness and predictability, so I had no high hopes for an album coming from an ESC winner (having said that, Loreen's sublime 2012 ""Heal"" proved to be the most unexpected pop revelation). Listening to this, its versatility and brilliance is rather overwhelming. Being a mix of genres, it combines pop, dance, and ballads, with eastern-flavoured elements and electro sprinkles. Not often one finds a set with many good tracks, but this debut is filled with 12. Highlights are the touching ""Other side of me"", the cabaret-influenced ""Where have all the good men gone"", universal single ""Heroes"", the magnificent ""Pure"" (absolutely epic), ""Colours of your love"" (a stupendous climaxing track), and of course ""Rise like a phoenix"", whose transcendent quality renders it a true classic. The smart digipack presentation completes a near-perfect package. ""It's basically the tracklist of my life"", says Conchita about the album. ""You can dance, you can cry, you can have a good time, and you can support your bad times. I see my life as a musical, and that's why this tracklist is so colourful."" Could not have said it better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12O6E7GK7ERS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDUL3WQ#wasThisHelpful","R12O6E7GK7ERS5","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New edition of the glorious 2006 Roxette box set, refreshed and updated. With extra songs from the ""Charm school"" and ""Travelling"" albums added, and a slightly revised back catalogue, it has also gotten a mini face-lift, presented in a plastic fatbox case (as opposed to the sturdy casebound longbook of the original release), with new layout, featuring some new pictures and liner notes. With another best-of released back in March, Roxette are releasing so many greatest hits, it is hard to keep up. To be fair, recent 2-disc ""XXX"" compilation is a comprehensive hits collection perfect for casual buyers; the ""Roxbox!"" is an anthology of most of the band's best moments, thus, appeals both to new and hardcore fans. And, since Warner has made this available for shipping everywhere, and at a reasonable price, everyone is happy. As Per Gessle has said about it: ""Some major Warner-markets wanted this box-compilation since we're touring a lot, so we waved the green flag."" The original 4CD+DVD ""Roxbox!"" remains the definitive Roxette box set, so far. This 2015 refreshed version is ideal for those who missed it the first time around (as long as they do not mind the omission of the collectible DVD), an essential buy of the highest order, from the sunniest pop band that has ever graced the earth!Note: The songs from the 2006 version missing are: ""The sweet hello, the sad goodbye (original 1990 version)"", ""Better off on her own"", ""New world"", ""Cooper"", and ""All I ever wanted"". In their place are: ""She's got nothing on (But the radio)"", ""No one makes it on her own"", ""Speak to me"", ""It's possible"", and ""The sweet hello, the sad goodbye (bassflow radio edit)"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IDU54QA16DAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKWZNZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3IDU54QA16DAZ","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1998's ""#1's"", Mariah Carey's first ever compilation, and one of her many multi-platinum sellers, featured an impressive 13 No. 1 singles, spanning from 1990 up until that year. 17 years on, ""#1 to infinity"" is an updated version, featuring an incredible - and record-breaking - 18 No. 1 singles, plus one brand new recording. Scoring only 5 more chart topping singles in the years that followed ""#1's"", makes clear that MC has not been enjoying more of those era-defining, hit-ladden days of the '90s; still, releasing an entire album of No. 1 singles is quite a feat, not to be underestimated. Released to coincide with the launch of her Las Vegas residency show at The Colosseum at Ceasars Palace, and celebrating 25 years since the release of her debut, ""#1 to infinity"", also, marks MC's return to Sony Music, 15 years since they parted ways.With 1995's ""Fantasy"", and 1997's ""Honey"" singles hinting towards a more urban sound, after 9 years into her recording career, MC opted for a more R'n'B-flavoured music style during the late 90s and early 00s, infusing her sound with hip-hop influences and rap musings. Unfortunately, her career from then on would suffer a major hit, from which she would only briefly recover with the release of the highly successful ""Emancipation"" album. Album by album, her music, as well as her image, changed pretty drastically, in an obvious attempt to compete with younger artists who emerged, and threatened to steal her popularity. ""Rainbow"" (1999), the most personal and transitional album in her catalogue, remains her most balanced set ever since, combining her trademark ballads with some uptempo grooves and funky jams.The disco-inspired ""Glitter"" (2001) project was a commercial failure, the disjointed ""Charmbracelet"" (2002) under-performed, ""E=MC2"" (2008) faired slightly better, ""Memoirs of an imperfect angel"" (2009) proved as self-indulgent as its title, and her second Christmas album was poorly received, too. It was just 2005's ""The emancipation of Mimi"" that did her justice, a well-rounded album that presented MC on top form, produced hits, and sold a lot. Even her rejuvenating ""Me. I am Mariah... The elusive chanteuse"" from last year failed to rehash her past glories, despite the positive feedback it garnered. Times have changed, and if anyone knows this best, that is MC. This new-old set, somewhat ironically, demonstrates how successful, though incredibly uneven she has been, throughout her 2+ decade course in the music industry.""#1 to infinity"" includes some of her finest works, and signature songs, showcasing her amazing vocal skills. At her core, MC is basically a torch singer; she is at her best on smoky ballads like the stunning ""I don't wanna cry"", or power-belters like the anthemic ""Hero"". Each of the 19 tracks on here, is testament to her talent to sing every lyric with intense passion and soul. Regardless of music styles, she shines on every note. She has brought too much to music to be dismissed: her voice, charm, great beats, old-school taste, interesting featurings. As the undisputed, youngest all-time best-selling female artist, an accomplishment in itself, MC may have long fallen from grace, but she remains elusive, indeed, entertaining, glorious, accomplished, unsurpassed, timeless. ""#1 to infinity"", is essentially a reminder of her greatness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266BNI0RROPQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8G7IGI#wasThisHelpful","R266BNI0RROPQF","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Expectations are too high for a number of reasons for REBEL HEART, undoubtedly one of the most anticipated music releases in recent years. So much, indeed, that just 3 months prior to its release, more than 30 of the songs that had been recorded for the album became available in demo versions on the internet. This leak definitely killed a lot of the momentum this album was supposed to have. However, the subsequent official pre-release of 6 tracks received a huge amount of positive feedback. Clearly illustrating her desire to confound and exceed all expectations placed upon her with each new recording, Madonna's lucky 13 (Brits' fall excluded!), is the record that more than any other of hers in the last decade will show to contemporary audiences that there is a reason why this lady has dominated the pop industry for the past 32 years.The album's generous 19 brand new songs, in total, appear like M's attempt to please everyone, and most of all the fans, to whom REBEL HEART comes as a long-awaited gift (much appreciated, thanks!). Here is a most varied and satisfying record, offering energetic electro-dance cuts, lush ballads, fun singalong ditties ...and the occasional clangers (surely some editing would be beneficial, but hey). If any confirmation were required of M's sustained cultural relevance, it is surely provided by these songs, some of which can contend with her best. Infusing her work with new elements and genres, less concerned than before with drawing younger generations of music, she sounds confident and relaxed. REBEL HEART comes as a bold re-affirmation of M's supremacy in a genre she created and perfected, being her most fascinating and entertaining set of songs since 2005.From the triumphant opener ""Living for love"", a thumping 90s throwback with classic M traits such as religious references and a gospel choir, all the way to the epic, confessional/biographic title-track closer, the tone veers between heartbreak ballads and hard-edged bangers. The infectious country-infused ""Devil pray"", the reggae/dubstep-influenced ""Unapologetic b*tch"", the frenetically bouncy ""Illuminati"", the celebrational trap/pop ""Iconic"", the playful, Eastern-flavoured ""Body shop"" with its gentle innuendo (in contrast to the similarly-themed ""Holy Water""'s forced shock value), and the utterly poptastic, self-referencial ""Veni, vidi, vici"", are all brilliant pop/dance tracks, guaranteed to excite and surprise. Best of all, is the soaring ""Hold tight"", combining uplifting shamanic drumming sounds with optimistic lyrics about unity and love (""Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright"").But it is the midtempo and slower tracks that are the album's showstealers. For a persona synonymous with strength and endurance, it is startling to hear her being vulnerable and revealing her weaknesses, as she does on the deeply moving ""Joan of Arc"". ""I can't be a superhero... Even hearts made out of steel can break down"", she admits with unparalleled melancholy, ""I'm only human"". It is the most sentimental track, and it would make a fantastic single. Highlights are the hopeful/sad ""Ghosttown"", and the exquisite ""Wash all over me"". The absolute standout, though, is the regal ""Messiah"", a finely crafted and executed elegy, harkening back to the spiritual introspection of her late 90s and early 00s albums. Pop's greatest narcissist is brave enough to dole out songs like these every once in a while but, also, smart enough to do so infrequently enough for them to be memorable.Perhaps the biggest criticism of the album is that it is too long or contradictory. Madonna's intention was to explore the rebel and the romantic side of her personality with this album, as she has said. So, that should be taken into account. It is essentially two separate albums which sound like a rather effortlessly and effectively flowing unified body of work. On top of this, while the album centres on herself, even when she slips hints or she is actually referencing her past hits on some tracks, it does not sound egotistical. Enhanced by her vocal clarity, REBEL HEART proves that M can still create an album that is very personal and distinctive, yet, also incorporating a sense of fulfilment and enjoyment. Interestingly, by the end of the record, there is a liberating impression that a chapter has closed, and another begins. Whether intentional or coincidental, the symbolism is surely striking.Already welcomed by rejoicing fans and curious casual listeners, and regardless of how well it is going to perform, REBEL HEART has for sure everything a hit record requires; a mix of great songs, the much-needed hype, even an iconic cover (wires rule!). The genius of M is that she never ceases to surprise and amaze. She has always had an impeccable charisma to be experimental, unpredictable, challenging, fearless, and still come out on top. She is a legend in her own right, a leader of contemporary pop artists, in a league all of her own. When she wears her heart on her sleeve, as she does for this album's better part, she is simply unmatched. That is why she is the only real Queen of Pop, if this title is anything to go by. Still standing, still standing out, she remains the undisputed pop royalty, and REBEL HEART is another precious jewel in her crown. All hail ...um, better ""take a bow""!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5E81ZTXOUJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RA10R6E#wasThisHelpful","RR5E81ZTXOUJ4","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Only 3 years between her debut and ""Let's get to it"", it is unbelievable how much Kylie really changed and developed. With previous album ""Rhythm of love"" cementing her gay icon status, as well as her signature sound, Kylie took more creative control on this, and quite a risk by changing her sound to a more urban feel. Obviously not concerned with just scoring hits, and clearly adopting a more refined approach to her work, being more than happy to get as far away as she could from the control and confines she was feeling at PWL (by the time this was released, Matt Aitken had left the SAW team), the album's tracks are more varied than those on ""Rhythm of love"". Although it did not sell as well as its predecessors, that did not discourage her; she continued in this direction on her 1994-1997 releases, where she got to fully blossom into an underground diva. The remastering is brilliant, and the care given into assembling this package is more than evident (I am not a fan of big-sized box sets, but this is superb). My favourite part of the package has to be the promo videos and special TV appearances, they are truly fantastic. But this is a fan's delight, with tons of remixes, photos and notes to enjoy. I splashed out  €100 euros for the limited collector's edition, but I will be picking up the 2CD+DVD editions of the other 3 titles (when I win the lottery I will buy the box sets!), I guess I like it like that!4**** for the album5***** for this edition","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35NCAPD9WAS94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR2NNMG#wasThisHelpful","R35NCAPD9WAS94","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1994 was such a great year for music: Tori Amos' magnificent ""Under the pink"", Sinead O'Connor's fragile ""Universal mother"", the Cranberries' nostalgic ""No need to argue"", Suede's elegiac ""Dog man star"", were all released that year. The latter, back in October 2014 was presented in a fantastic limited edition package. Just before the year ended, the Manic Street Preacher's phenomenal ""The Holy Bible"" got a neat deluxe treatment, too. Remastered by James Dean Bradfield and Tim Young, the album is presented on heavyweight vinyl, for the first time since a limited run in 1994. Also fearured are the band's 1994 Astoria show recorded by the BBC, and a collection of acoustic performances recorded at the band's 2014 Radio 4 Mastertapes session. Obviously this edition is for fans and collectors, so anyone reading this most probably is familiar (possibly obsessed, too) with the songs. For those who are not aware of this record, it is one of the darkest albums ever recorded, one that has to be listened to in order to witness and appreciate its penetrating, astounding brilliance. Certainly not the most accessible material, but definitely one of the most rewarding and unforgettable listening experiences.Contents:- VINYL: LP pressing on 180 gram vinyl- CD 1: ""The Holy Bible""- CD 2: ""The Holy Bible"" (US mix)- CD 3: B-Sides- CD 4: Live- HARDBACK BOOK (40pp): Includes rare photos and artwork, handwritten lyrics and notes from Richey Edwards, and by the bandTracklisting:LP (Side A)01.

"From 1992's shattering ""Little earthquakes"" to 2011's haunting ""Night of hunters"", Tori Amos has certainly come a long way. With 12 studio albums, and 40+ singles, her compelling songwriting genius has produced countless moments to treasure forever. Celebrating 2 decades of recording, Tori decides to pay a visit to her back catalogue. She does not really need a reason for revisiting her own stuff whenever she pleases, but this anniversary calls for a special flashback. Never one to follow the usual tactics of most artists, even when it comes to re-releasing old material, she does it in her own unorthodox way. Instead of gathering the obvious hits, she makes an unexpected selection of tracks to comprise this career-retrospective release, that serves more as a reminder of her idiosyncratic artistic persona rather than a typical greatest hits package.Drawing from 10 of her 12 albums, ""Dust"" presents a 14-song setlist that forms a Tori-fic concept record. Being the mother of these babies, Tori is entitled to her own cherry-picking, no matter how peculiar it seems. Not afraid of giving birth once again to her girls-songs, she goes one step furher and re-records them with full orchestral backing (courtesy of the Netherlands-based Metropole Orchestra), and she manages to offer new perspective to some of them, often even surpassing the tremendous strength of the early versions. Bold or unnecessary, re-interpreting such a repertoire is a challenging experiment, thus, she can be forgiven for the occasional self-indulgence. ""Dust"" is a pretty accessible record for newcomers and casual listeners alike, representing Tori's prolific catalogue. New arrangements, new vocals, new old, new gold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW0N7WE1EHCHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ0QV5I#wasThisHelpful","RW0N7WE1EHCHG","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Billed as Bjork's ""break-up record"", ""Vulnicura"" leaves little to speculate. The cover image of Bjork with a gaping chest wound, provides a visual representation of the album's thematology. As for the curious title, when broken down, the latin words ""vulnus"" and ""cura"" respectively translate to ""injury"" and ""healing"". Though hardly a novel concept, Bjork takes this personal and introspective matter, and skillfully renders it universal, by creating an album in which to find solace, despite its heartbreaking content. After a long period of philosophical (and often pretty inaccessible) albums, she returns with the most human-centered album of her career, which, to those familiar with her work, is some kind of apocalypse. Especially, when considering that the record leaked, and was rush-released, a fact that seems to have done Bjork an inadvertent service, thus, allowing listeners to focus purely on the the actual material. The album's 9 songs, chronicling the story of a relationship, are almost inextricably linked with one another. However, special mention has to be made of the album's glorious centrepiece, ""Black lake"", and the dramatic opener ""Stonemilker"". Reaching further than ever before, with ""Vulnicura"", Bjork proves that she is a phenomenal artist and, also, an amazing human being: wacky, weird, wondrous, wonderful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15FPLAUCKBP9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI9614O#wasThisHelpful","R15FPLAUCKBP9S","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comebacks are hard, but Fall Out Boy seem to know how to avoid the risk of a possible failure. As it would be rather predictable to attempt recapturing their successful brand of alternative punk-pop sound once again, instead, they choose to borrow from different genres and mix various elements, creating a sound that is very different from their previous albums. With numerous samples, plenty of pop culture references, roaring guitars, killer hooks, and sharp deliveries, the result is a small triumph. Single ''Centuries'', which turns Suzanne Vega's ''Tom's diner'''s hypnotic ""du du du du"" melody into a contemporary anthem, and pre-destined hit ""Uma Thurman"", which brilliantly juxtaposes the ""Pulp fiction"" actress to ""The Munsters"" theme tune, are devilishly irresistible slices of electro-rock. ""American beauty / American psycho"" is filled with such complexities, which, combined with their skilled songwriting, work really well for the most part of the album. What the band intended to produce was the right level of artistic progress and fun, as they said, and that is what they did. With the teen angst that was prevalent in their early albums being replaced by a more mature sound, seems that Fall Out Boy have reached their experimental phase, and what a pleasure it is to be doing so in such a winning manner! (Note: Vinyl fans will love the frosty clear blue-coloured LP, I know I did, it looks totally awesome!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOU9TP9J7960/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBEQWII#wasThisHelpful","R2MOU9TP9J7960","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Blow us a kiss, we'll blow you to pieces"", says the verse to ""Killing strangers"", opener (and one of the standout tracks) to ""The pale Emperor"", a fireshot at American culture, reminiscent of its creator's glorious, infamous past. ""We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we love"", bears the chorus. Hmm, scary thought but so very true... ""You're a paper doll, I fold you how I want"", he goes on on ""Warship my wreck"", to continue: ""Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules, if I can glue 'em back together"", displaying a vulnerable side that has very rarely been heard in the past. Along with single ""Third day of a seven day binge"" and closer ""Odds of even"", these cuts - that are some of Marilyn Manson's best ever- are rather indicative of the overall thematology and sound of this new album, his best in a decade.On ""The pale Emperor"", his 9th studio record, Manson unleashes a soul-baring mood of his frayed character. Nothing scary or intimidating about it. Instead, with just a few bursts of the delicious stadium glam rock of the past, MM feels less bold and adventurous than in the past, often sounding, well, pale. But the few punchy tracks are enough to make up for the plenty midtempos on here, and also show his knack for hooks that appear sickly sweet but are rotten to the core, proof that no-one else does wasted decadence with such swagger as his. Heavier elements are very low compared to previous albums, becoming exceptions rather than standards, but there is reason for this: ""I realised that I need to focus more on creating than destroying"", said Manson in a recent interview with Metal Hammer, giving an insight into his change in mind-frame.Back in the late '90s and early '00s , Marilyn Manson's videos used to be small works of art, full of symbolism, incredible cinematography, exceptional set/costume design. His music was equally compelling; hammering anthems and breathtaking ballads with personal and universal quality or appeal, containing agression and fragility, frustration and optimism, often all within one song. Everything about MM meant or signified something, stirring controversy and fascination, making him a true gothic industrial icon. My personal favourite, ""Holy Wood"", is a little too heavy, too ambitious and too self-indulgent, however it is a stunning, intense landmark of an album, a timeless 70+ minute opus of musical, lyrical and artistic genius. But nothing stays at the height of their power indefinitely, which is only natural.Marilyn Manson can boast that he is a man aware of what has been going around him. ""The pale Emperor"" feels like the product of a clear mindset, from someone who is not trying to relive his former glories or reclaim the edginess that made his name in the first place. That would be stupid to do at this point; equally pointless is to go into the new album, expecting another ""Antichrist superstar"" or ""Holy Wood"". Although ""The pale Emperor"" is pretty far from incomparable to MM's top material, it significantly boosts his relevance (which is rather necessary, following his failed-glam-figure status of late years), being an honest album that manifests that Manson's music can work surprisingly well without the shock element. Being wicked certainly suits him (after all, he is the former God of F*ck), but he is more than that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZHYEYO9PKO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEJG1K0#wasThisHelpful","R2OZHYEYO9PKO7","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2005, ""Corpse bride"" had most wondering whether it could top Tim Burton's magnificent, groundbreaking classic animated romp, ""The nightmare before Christmas"". Although it is very much in the same thematic vein, it is even darker in tone, with its creator's gleefully morbid imagination at full speed. Despite its grotesque title, with a charmingly original storyline based around someone accidentally ""marrying"" a corpse, ""Corpse bride"" may sound like an odd, slightly twisted concept at first, but it ironically proves to be a most inviting and heart-warming film. Reknowned for his weird and macabre tales, Tim Burton here presents a story that finely balances between romantic pathos and gruesome laughs, creating a hilarious and bittersweet animated operetta. The voice casting is first-class, and the mood of the film is greatly aided by the wonderful dark, jazzy score and songs by Danny Elfman. Among the biggest achievements is the exquisite animation. Being the first stop-motion film to be created wholly on digital cameras to capture an ultra-sharp image (which is complimented highly by the blu-ray transfer), the bonus features give some amazing insight into how this dreamy gothic fairytale was created, and the effort involved in bringing it to life. A stunning film to look at, visually, and a true work of art, technically, ""Corpse bride"" is utterly mesmerising, one of Burton's best pieces of work ever (and a cut above ""The nightmare before Christmas""). Enchantingly sublime, it is nothing short of a masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZQOWWBULZMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I5XOWI#wasThisHelpful","R1QZQOWWBULZMF","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially dubbed Tourism 2, 2rism and T2, ""Travelling"" is the sequel to the 1992, 7+ million-selling album of ""Tourism"". Followed on from the massively successful world tour of Roxette's ""Charm school"" album, it features a mix of studio and live material, newly-arranged old songs, stripped down or acoustic versions, big ballads and power pop numbers. Although it could easily have been scattered and unfocused, instead, it is a cohesive and fun collection, finding the band reunited, rejuvenated, and sounding as good as they ever have. Filled with the hook-laden pop brilliance one has come to expect, there is a strident Beatles-esque feel, making the album sound refreshingly different to their previous ones. Per Gessle's talent for writing irresistible, catchy pop songs, assisted by Marie Fredriksson's fragile and powerful vocals, are the reasons to their songs sounding nostalgic and fresh at the same time, and improving with repeated listenings. Proof of their never-ending inspiration, is the new version of their classic hit ""It must have been love""; with 5 other already recorded versions, it could seem rather unnecessary to add another one. Listening to Marie's mesmerising delivery, with an orchestra backing the track, surprises and excites. Roxette have always been a breath of fresh air in a world full of the stench of pop mass, just like their fellow Swedes, the all-conquering ABBA, were some decades earlier. If you like to travel in style, ""Travelling"" is a perfect accessory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XB5JVLASOA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074Y2YZ4#wasThisHelpful","R37XB5JVLASOA4","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Former Nicki Minaj hater, hence the title) With hype from MTV VMAs, and previously released singles ""Pills 'n' potions"", and especially ""Anaconda"", as well as one of the best guest line-ups of the year (including Chris Brown, Drake, Ariana Grande and Beyonce), expectations for her new album were high, but Nicki Minaj has definitely delivered. Making a departure from the dance-pop-flavoured second album, the cartoonish rap queen presents on ""The pinkprint"" a harder, edgier sound, closer to her traditional rap-hip-hop beginnings, brightened with poppier melodies, and most surprising of all, actual singing. Her tongue can run faster than one can spell Iggy, but only a few songs on here can approach the velocity of previous material. With the album's lyrics touching upon themes of family, insecurities and loss, among others, it is surely more fitting. She engages in her usual fast flow on a couple of fun and uptempo cuts, and it works in her favour (with the exception of the utterly skippable ""Anaconda"").""Feeling myself"" is among the most interesting upbeat tracks, but I am not going to spoil the fun by giving away the ""fun"" element of it, it has to be listened to! ""Trini dem girls"" is another one. Yet, for all the album's fierceness, it keeps returning to heartache, mostly evidenced by the slower cuts (""I lied"", ""Bed of lies""), particularly by the absolute standout, closing track ""Grand piano""; an unexpected ballad that features piano (naturally) and, wait for it, a violin! Vulnerable and personal, showcasing immense growth vocally in contrast with the almost robotic delivery of the past, this is Nicki Minaj deeply connected to her own artistry, sharing a rare moment of intimacy with the audience. All in all, ""The pinkprint"" reveals a different, more balanced side to Nicki Minaj's character, presenting some of the most superlative work of her career. Never thought the day I would speak so positively for her ""Minajesty"" would come, but here it is. Just like its minimalistic, elegant cover art, ""The pinkprint"" is bold and memorable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33REFV5C7EQSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGPK4SI#wasThisHelpful","R33REFV5C7EQSK","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Documenting the band's unique performance of the ""Ghost stories"" album to an exclusive audience of fans in March 2014, ""Ghost stories live 2014"" presents Coldplay's ground-breaking production, nominated for Best Live Coverage at this year's UK Music Video Awards. Shot in a custom-built amphitheatre at Sony Studios, in LA, and filmed by Grammy-nominated director Paul Dugdale, it is a most enjoyable spectacle, capturing this very special occasion. Frontman Chris Martin said that this sequenced film is basically the band's originally conceived idea: a visual representation of the ""Ghost stories"" album. Listening to these songs while watching the overhead imagery, actually feels much more satisfying than just listening to the immersive dreamlike soundscape of the album which, ever since its release, leaves me with the impression that is void of a certain something. After watching ""Ghost stories Live"", I may have found some missing element; this visual seems to be working as a great companion to it. The release also contains an exclusive live album, recorded between April and July 2014 at the band's shows in London, Sydney, Paris, Cologne, NY and LA. The package is completed by 8 music videos, including 2 films for B-Sides ""All your friends"" and ""Ghost story"", plus the extended director's cut of the ""Magic"" video.

"Taking into account the fact that concision is not Joni Mitchell's forte, one can imagine how impossible a task it was condensing 40 years of recordings into a mere disc, as was originally intended. She was obviously expected to fail, while trying to distill her own back catalogue down to a single, ballet-themed disc. So, here is a 4-Act ballet based on 53 songs that make up this stunning collection, organized into different thematic acts, with many sonic adjustments, presented in a glorious box set. The process, she says, was a lot like making a film. ""I had forty years of footage to review. Then, suddenly, scenes began to hook up, ...themes began to develop. Moods sustained. I was getting there... When this long editorial process (two years) finally came to rest, I had four ballets or a four-act ballet - a quartet. I also had a box set."" We now have it, and it is nothing short of amazing.Compiled, annotated, and designed by herself, the hardback book contains 53 songs spread on 4 discs, with their lyrics printed on the book's glossy pages, 6 new paintings, and an extensive autobiographical text, illuminating aspects of the recording process. Showcasing her wisdom and intelligence, through the soulful and jazz-inflected music created over the years, and with emphasis given on material from her overlooked albums (this is the only fault of this astonishing collection, ie ""Cactus tree"", ""Big yellow taxi"" and ""Woodstock"" are some glaring ommisions),""Love..."" is a long overdue career-retrospective. It stands as a gorgeous potrait of this most idiosyncratic artist, whose legacy will never cease to amaze. ""Love has many faces"", indeed, but this particular album is a labour of love that has the face of an archetypal singer/songwriter stamped all over it. Joni genius.Tracklisting:CD 101.

"The release of ""Re-classified"" is rather puzzling, as it is neither a new album, nor an EP. With 7 songs already featured on previous versions of ""The new classic"", the 5 brand new cuts (""We in this b*tch"", ""Beg for it"", ""Trouble"", ""Iggy SZN"", ""Heavy crown"") could be the second disc on a repackaged version of Iggy's debut album. Anyway. More than half of the songs on Iggy's first album were about her experiences making it in music, and how cool she is. On here she is getting all materialistic, further bragging about her new-found success. No surprise then, since she certainly has strong energy and confidence to support this persona. However, she is also enjoyable, and even more relatable, when she becomes more introspective, showing that she has potential for making music that is equally substantial and impactful. For the time being she is offering delicious hits, which is fine. I just wish that her thematology becomes more varied in the future, and not just boast about superficial acquisitions. That is when she will become a real ""class"" act.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R147S8WRG9OQ6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OISSEC6#wasThisHelpful","R147S8WRG9OQ6F","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For ""Listen"", his follow-up to 2011's smash ""Nothing but the beat"", David Guetta said that he changed his working methods, building tracks acoustically rather than adding vocals to a beat. Whatever the method, the result is as impressive as ever. As with any DG album, the list of collaborators is nothing short of stellar. Many of the tracks may utilise familiar formulas, but when they sound this good it is anything but negative. In fact, what I enjoy most about the new album is the creativity with which he pushes the musical envelope with some tracks and the artists that he chooses to collaborate with. Mixing dance, pop and electronica, fantastic beats, killer hooks and a sprinkling of powerful vocals, he has crafted another solid dance album, filled with potential smash hits. Lead single ""Dangerous"" featuring Sam Martin is so out of left field that had me taken aback by its stunning brilliance. But it is ""The whisperer"", his new collaboration with Sia, that will really catch everyone off guard (unless anyone is expecting a piano ballad from him). He may be accused for producing formulaic EDM, but he sure is the golden goose churning out golden egg after golden egg. This might as well be a platinum one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0AMYKLXKRU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O67EPRW#wasThisHelpful","R3F0AMYKLXKRU8","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since 1994, there is one Christmas album that I keep buying religiously every year for the seasonal gifts. That is Mariah Carey's ""Merry Christmas"". Cheerful, jolly, a little melancholic too, beautifully assembled inside-out, a perfect package. Although her second attempt with ""Merry Christmas II you"" failed to excite me as much, Mariah's poppy vibe is a guaranteed winner. There you have a wonderful collection of festive classics as well as some new cuts (that are 20 years old by now!), beautifully executed and presented in new old-fashioned style. Mariah's voice is a perfect instrument suitable for those trademark ballads she is best loved for, as well as for traditional numbers. Single ""All I want for Christmas is you"" is a true Christmas classic, only topped by Wham's ""Last Christmas"", which is arguably the most Christmas-associated festive song; but Mariah's version of ""O Holy Night"", is also spectacular, just like her fittingly subdued version of ""Silent Night"", and the melancholic, newly-penned at the time ""Miss you most (At Christmas time)"". Many artists have subsequently presented festive albums, however, Mariah's gorgeous collection of religious and secular songs remains unsurpassed. Right then, I'm off to order a few more copies! Merry Christmas, everyone, 'tis the season to be jolly!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IOOKCREKCNK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2J1J5S#wasThisHelpful","R2IOOKCREKCNK3","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until a few years ago, the only ""zig"" I knew was the Spice Girls' ""zig-a-zig-ah!"" from ""Wannabe"" (teenage fixations are dangerous!). Listening to this collection, cleverly presented in reverse chronological order, has made me realise that David Bowie is an artist rather underrated by my generation. Prolific is an adjective often used to describe him, and his songwriting, as well as his ever-changing music styles; these 59 tracks are proof. What impresses me more than anything is that, despite his later work which I am more familiar with, most of his early material sounds even more interesting. Unable to form an opinion since I am not a fan, still I find his shift from troubadour to glam rock king, and others changing roles in between, certainly admirable. Diversity and experimentation were obviously no strangers to him! The artwork and the packaging offer an extra nice touch to an item which is special by itself. Presented in a gatefold cardboard case that opens to reveal 4 images from different stages of DB looking in the mirror (vanity is no stranger to him either!), it is certainly worth spending a little extra in order to have the more comprehensive 3-disc package which includes 2 booklets (these could have been more detailed), a necessary accompaniment to all retrospective releases, but often ommitted by many. As a casual listener of DB's music, ""Nothings has changed"" seems pretty comprehensive and rather essential. Some things change, some don't. I am just pleased that I finally got to get properly introduced to Ziggy Stardust!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYMCRHCG7HM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMUCI6Y#wasThisHelpful","RAYMCRHCG7HM6","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Depeche Mode are my favourite band. They have not stopped progressing throughout the years, while maintaining their original trademark DM qualities. Mostly, though, I love them because they never fail to excite me with every release, ever since I became acquainted with the sublime ""Songs of faith and devotion"", which somehow shaped my music taste. And then there is Dave Gahan; the ultimate male singer/performer, the embodiment of a charismatic band leader. Here is DM presenting their 25 & 27-11-2013 live performances for the acclaimed ""Delta machine"" record, which saw them boasting their classic DM element while pushing their sound furthermore.Filmed and recorded by their longtime creative collaborator, Anton Corbijn, ""Live in Berlin"" is a polished, mastefully assembled presentation, sheer proof of the band's energetic and timeless appeal. Spread over 2 CDs and 2 DVDs, the set list is nicely balanced, featuring new material and older hits. What is included are: the ""Live in Berlin"" full show audio across 2 CDs, a ""Live in Berlin"" DVD, a second DVD, entitled ""Alive in Berlin"", which includes the full live show, behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with the band and fans, and a 2-song acoustic session (""Condemnation"" and ""Judas"", filmed at Salon Bel Ami, a brothel in Berlin). Also included is the 17-track deluxe edition of 2013 ""Delta machine"" album 5.1 mix on blu-ray.All these come packaged in a stylish lift-off box, that includes 5 mini-jackets housing the aforementioned discs, plus a 16-page booklet, illustrated with tour photos. Despite the obvious non-HD picture quality (director's artistic choice, apparently), and the lack of extras, what is more important is the fact that this release captures DM in great form, unlike their previous tour package which was pristinely presented but showed the band in just good form. Good is not acceptable from them, only great will suffice. ""Live in Berlin"" is another testament that DM continue to produce exciting albums and compelling live shows right up to the present day.The Devotional Tour was DM's most excessive, in all aspects, live experience; the Singles Tour, and the Exciter Tour, were a much needed step down; Touring the Angel found them coming right back to the top; Tour of the Universe was a hit-and-miss affair; and now the Delta Machine Tour, a musical and visual creative high. DM are the only band who succeeded in being consistently relevant, without sacrificing their artistic integrity, with vision and thoughtfulness showcased in every aspect of their work. As I have said on another occasion, in a time where pretty much everything is ""depeche"", they most certainly are not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F2TTMRJYN2PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5LQCFM#wasThisHelpful","R1F2TTMRJYN2PQ","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am old enough to remember how big and exciting news was the release of The Division Bell [2011 - Remaster], back in 1994, but young enough to think of the subsequent 20 years as a lifetime. The impact of that album was tremendous. So much, in fact, that I felt almost obliged to purchase the recent, spectacular and precious in all aspects, The Division Bell 20th Deluxe Box. Whenever the name Pink Floyd comes up, I genuinely feel nothing but utmost respect for this band who has remained consistent throughout their 49-year course, showcasing unique talent and vision in their discography, and exhibiting integrity like very few other bands have. ""The endless river"", athough featuring mostly instrumental pieces, presents everything that defines Pink Floyd: it is psychedelic, ambitious, emotional, haunting, occasionally self-indulgent, ultimately distinctive. As this is their final record, I am excited to be able to enjoy the first new Pink Floyd album in 20 years, hoping that, in another 20 years from now, I will be reminiscing about the past, thinking about how excited I am feeling now, just like I did back in 1994.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182SMFSE91977/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQWTGZE#wasThisHelpful","R182SMFSE91977","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When God gives us a gift, no one can take it away. God's gift to Whitney was her angelic voice. Whitney Houston was a vocal prodigy. Her voice was the platinum standard of what a woman's voice should be. What distinguished her from her peers was that she was a rare artist who could interpret a live vocal performance in different ways, and still make it sound just as good, or even better, than the studio version. Her ability to play with melody was underrated genius. Her natural talent was simply incomparable. Her range and voice control was impeccable. No cracks or out of tune pitch, just effortless delivery. Her soaring voice was able to move mountains and skies, showcasing a tremendous technique while simultaneously touching the hearts and spirits of people, bringing comfort and strength, instilling pride and faith.We do not aways know what our gift from God is, or even how to use it. All we need to do is keep our faith. Alhough Whitney did know how to command her instrument, she lacked faith, and so allowed her demons to take over. No one is perfect, and we all have struggles. Hers were made public, but she stood tall. One can say whatever they want about the gradual deterioration of her voice due to her addictions but, up until she sang her last note, she sang live. For better or worse, she had integrity when it came to her singing. She knew at points she sounded weak but she never faked it. She showed that it was not about perfection or the expectations of others. She had to sing as good and powerful as she could at any given time, it was all about singing, about the performance, the emotional intent and the impact she brought out in her performances. Although not even comparable with her vocal prime, her voice had the weight of her life on it, always so emotional.There are not enough superlatives to describe how awesome she was. Prodigy, tour de force, myth, icon, diva, legend. ""Whitney Houston live: Her greatest performances"" illuminates the insurmountable career of the undisputed Queen of Soul whose spirit will never die, and whose musical legacy shall remain unmatched. From her auspicious television debut on The Merv Griffin Show to her glorious comeback/farewell on Oprah Winfrey (one of her final public appearances), this magnificent collection will be forever reminding audiences that, under dozens of stage lights and maddening crowds, in order to silence a crowd all this woman ever needed was a spotlight and the gift in her throat. She was, and always will be the best. Nippy, I look to you, and I will always love you.Note: DVD includes 2 extra tracks, ""My love is your love"" music video, plus Whitney and Mariah Carey's duet of ""When you believe"", as performed at the 71st Annual Academy Awards (1999), both not featured on the CD of the set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1228HKQ67AZ3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG6FMOE#wasThisHelpful","R1228HKQ67AZ3W","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now, this is an early Christmas treat! Always been a fan of the Divine Miss M.'s acting and musical work, she is such an accomplished all-rounder, always mixing up her repertoire, I can never tire of her (can anyone with good taste, really?). Having recorded throughout the years different styles such as ballads, rock 'n' roll, cabaret, boogie-woogie, this, her 25th solo album, pays tribute to girl groups from the past 7 decades. All the way from the irresistible swing of '30s trio The Boswell Sisters' album title track to '90s TLC's heartbreakingly gorgeous ""Waterfalls"", this marvellous collection is guaranteed to get feet tapping and throats singing along (a tear or two may also be expected from daydreamers). Any true fan would be a fool to miss out on this; casual listeners, too, will surely get carried away by its brilliance.

"1989: Pop music was inspired, emotive, meaningful, entertaining. Most of the hit songs written in the '80s still sound great and most have stood the test of time. 2014: Pop music has devolved to being bland, repetitive, processed, soulless. And as about as lasting as the fizz in an open can of soda. 25 year-old pop sensation Taylor Swift is a professional who knows how to develop her craft, she is incredibly successful, and this is why her brand new album is deemed newsworthy. ""1989"", named for the year she was born, is co-written and co-produced by herself, and pop svengali Max Martin and fellow partner Shellback. Here is this young lady sheding her country-pop profile, and going full pop, making a bold transition from a teen country superstar to a young pop diva. Surprisingly (or perhaps not so much), she totally succeds. Taylor-made to the last detail, oozing confidence, maturity, and showcasing her undeniable talent, ""1989"" proves to be a winner.Even more refreshing is the positive outlook of TS. Somewhere between the catchy hooks, and the simplicity of the lyrics, one is reminded that, some things that might seem important, really they are not in the scheme of things, and we should shake a lot of it off and move on. This most enlightning perspective is among the purposes music is supposed to serve, and one that any accomplished pop artist should be able to perpetuate. From her 2006 debut's incredible success onwards, Taylor Swift has been going from strength to strength. 8 years on, she has become a fixture in the music industry and, ultimately, a defining force. There is something to be said for a pop artist who does not trade in sleaze. I may be a GaGa devotee, a Rihanna maniac, a Lana Del Rey worshipper, a Madonna fannatic, but this young lady has talent, taste, and she is making the most of her opportunities. ""1989"" will most probably become another record-breaker. I say, good for her.Standard and deluxe editions come with 5 different sets of 13 exclusive Taylor photo prints, a nice touch (and a clever commercial trick) that makes worth purchasing the physical copy of the album; reminiscent of collecting artist memorabilia, so '80s, so nostalgic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HH8LG1X2I639/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRHANNI#wasThisHelpful","R1HH8LG1X2I639","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following the completion of the re-issues series that started in 2013, it was only inevitable that a collective set would follow, too. So here it is, ""The complete studio albums"" box set by the iconic pop femme fatalle Belinda Carlisle. In the tradition of most similar releases, the set gathers all 7 studio BC albums in their standard editions (not the recent expanded ones), presented in replica mini-LP sleeves, simply but nicely packaged in an elegant clamshell box. Anyone with an interest in Belinda will have heard the music on the original releases, however I will make a few comments about each album.BELINDA, BC's solo debut, emerged in 1986, a year after former band - and America's most successful all-female group - the Go-Go's, were gone-gone. ""I have a feeling of starting out again"", she said at the time. ""I don't know what's going to happen. But the Go-Go's went No. 1 on their first album, so anything's possible."" As was proved, it was. Fresh from rehab, and in great contrast to the Go-Go's punk image, for her own image and sound Belinda adopted a more innocent and feminine look, successfully re-introducing and re-launching herself. The album was a promising first effort, which would lead to a fruitful solo career, as subsequent releases attested. Featuring hit singles ""Mad about you"" and ""I feel the magic"", the heartbreaking ""Stuff and nonsense"", and the achingly melancholic ""Since you've gone"", ""Belinda"" captured the essence of Belinda, and also many hearts (mine included) along the way. (3***)HEAVEN ON EARTH (1987), proved to be Belinda's breakthrough album internationally, and also her most successful. Single ""Heaven is a place on earth"" reached No. 1 all around the world; ""I get weak"" and the hauntingly beautiful ""Circle in the sand"" were smashes, too. Clean of drugs, happy with her husband, and basking in the adoration of millions of fans while on Good Heavens! tour, Belinda's confidence was newly restored since the Go-Go's split, taking her to great - personal as well as professional - heights. Along with Madonna and Michael Lackson, Belinda was on top of her game during those years, establishing her name for good with her sleek 1980's power pop-rock quality. ""Nobody owns me"", she claims on one of the album highlights, and that was possibly true then. ""Heaven on earth"" could not have been more prophetic as a title, a heavenly record in every sense. (4****)RUNAWAY HORSES arrived 2 years later. Although it maintained Belinda's popularity, it did not reach the commercial peak of ""Heaven"". Apparently, there were disagreements regarding promotional tactics; it did not help either that US so-called music experts snubbed it at the time. Still, ""Horses"" sold very well worldwide, reaching gold, platinum and double platinum status in many markets. It spawned 6 hit singles (arguably all 10 songs could have been released as singles), an impressive accomplishment on its own, even more so considering the circumstances. The pop brilliance encountered on this record is unparalleled, that is why it is considered to be Belinda's magnum opus, a bona-fide record, a pop landmark; it is indeed all of the above. Her personal favourite song is included here (""Summer rain""), mine, too (""Vision of you""). 1989 was a great year for pop music, ""Horses"" is one of the reasons. Hop on and enjoy the ride. (5*****)1991's LIVE YOUR LIFE BE FREE found Belinda in the midst of a severe drug problem. Interestingly, and ironically enough, this set of songs is her most optimistic and carefree; plus, she looks at her absolute best on videos and photo shoots from that era (the unforgettable ""Do you feel like I feel"" video is simply iconic). Dangerously poptastic, full of catchy choruses and addictive melodies, the album sounds effortlessly engaging. Considering the cancellation of the promo tour due to her pregnancy, it faired pretty well, despite Belinda claiming later on that this is her least favorite record. Obviously this has to do with the fact that she was not pleased with how her label was handling her music at the time. But with so many brilliantly crafted pop gems one after another, ""LYLBF"" is one of her all-time best, a close second to ""Horses"". And take notice of the great statement the anthemic title track makes, thanks for that Belinda! (5*****)REAL followed in 1993. More guitar-based and raw, it was a departure from the perfectly polished pop of previous albums. Affected by motherhood, Belinda consciously chose to change direction with this, offering a more personal and mature set of songs, which lacked the immediate, broad commercial appeal of past albums. A change in her image was obvious, too, hardly wearing any make-up on the stark cover and inside photos, as if trying to strip altogether (hmmm, please do!). Contributing to the overall sincerity is the fact that she co-wrote most of the songs, which also explains the intensity of her delivery. ""Lay down your arms"" and ""One with you"" are the record's instant grabbers, the rest of the album calls for repeated listenings before coming to appreciate it. ""Too much water"" and the almost religious ""Where love hides"" are favourites. Although it was hugely ignored, ""Real"" is the real deal. Really. (4****)After briefly re-uniting with the Go-Go's, Belinda returned to the recording studio, and resumed working. In 1996, she released her 6th solo album, A WOMAN AND A MAN. Consisting of sleek, finely-crafted, perfectly accessible songs, this is Belinda's most safe and balanced album. This was her gift to the faithful fans, who stood be her since the very beginning (thanks, our pleasure!). Showcasing an artist at her most confident and alluring state, on this album she shines vocally, exhibiting precision and emotion simultaneously. I fondly remember her tres-chic UK TV appearances for the promo of ""Always breaking my heart"", where she wore some lovely dresses with cherry prints on them, what a classy lady! The album included several hits, and revitalized her solo career in Europe. As a result of this success, it was released in the US, a year later, but with no much luck. A fan-favourite. (4****)In 2007, Belinda released her 7th album, VOILA, her first full-length solo studio album in more than 10 years. ""After discovering and coming to love French music, I decided to record these amazing songs myself, with a playful, contemporary feel."", she said. The result is a most unexpected surprise, but a rather pleasant one! Living in France explains her almost impeccable pronounciation, but it is her trademark tremulous vibrato that matches perfectly those songs, breathing sexiness and sophistication to standards which have been re-interpreted countless times, such as ""Ne me quitte pass"" and ""Avec le temps"". This was certainly an out-of-the-box choice, one risky task which she skillfully accomplished. ""Voila"" is magnificent, just like Belinda herself. Merci et bravo, Belinda, vous tes une chanteuse magnifique! Felicitations! (4****)From her punk roots to a French language album, Belinda Carlisle has certainly come a long way. Regardless of her personal weaknesses, her remarkable artistic progression, and the fact that she kept a healthy distance from the demands of the industry (occasionally paying the price for it), they say a lot. Pop may be frivolous and fleeting, but she is acknowledged as an iconic popstress, though an underrated one. This is a collection guaranteed to entertain casual listeners, and excite pop fannatics. Anyone who is in for a pop trip, they will treasure this forever. Me, I will be forever in love with this flame-haired beauty with the razor sharp cheekbones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109MDI8JZNDED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1LVJUG#wasThisHelpful","R109MDI8JZNDED","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sexy, outrageous, camp, flamboyant, risque, grandiose; if one had to find the right word to describe Army of Lovers, that would be ""excessive"". Any other epithet is an understatement for this ""gay"" band behind those hysterical crazy disco hits of the 90s. Never in the history of popular music there has ever been a group as both ambiguous and universal. AOL were so much more than just a fun trio / quartet singing and dancing; their fabulous, fluffy pop songs were pure fun, utterly entertaining, transcending boundaries and breaking barriers. This is the most comprehensive AOL compilation out of the 3 that have been released, featuring a fantastic 18-track selection from their glorious repertoire. An essential purchase for any pop lover, even for those who are not familiar with the genius of Alexander Bard (the man behind AOL, and various other band-projects over the years), it is likely that most will crave for more. Given the sheer perfection of their material, it is totally beyond me how they have received such little recognition, when they could have exploded to become the absolute global pop extravaganza of all time. Because they were that great. Guaranteed to get even the laziest of feet tapping, and with the lyrics printed on the booklet, you'd be a fool not to groove and croon along to these stellar tunes!

"Multi-million album sellers such as ""The colour of my love"", ""Falling into you"" and ""Let's talk about love"", established Celine Dion as the undisputed easy-listening popstress of the '90s. In the '00s, it was ""A new day has come"" which maintained that glorious status. From then on, she has been mostly pre-occupied with motherhood and coping with her husband's health issues, exhibiting a most admirable dedication to her family. Somewhat inevitably, she did not meet with the audience's high expectations ever since; with the small exception of 2007's 3-million-selling ""Taking chances"", which only produced a couple of minor hits, none of her English or French albums made much of an impact. 2013's ""Loved me back to life"", CD's first album of original material in 6 years, arrived in hope of placing her back to her throne, but its reception and commercial success were equally disappointing. Although it is refreshing to witness an R'n'B flavour on some tracks, and her edgier than usual approach on others is surprisingly welcome, most of the songs on here are under par. Saving the set from total mediocrity are the hauntingly euphoric title track, the unexpectedly groovy for Celine's standards ""Somebody loves somebody"", and the stunning ""Breakaway"", hands down her finest recent recording. Thanks to these aforementioned tracks, ""LMBTL"" shows that CD should not be underestimated in the current pop world. Even if this set failed to spark her old diva flame, it shows there is still fire burning inside her.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2DNIBGRTZD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CVRQLY#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2DNIBGRTZD5","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""To have been given the opportunity to record these classic, timeless songs on such a significant label as Blue Note ... is truly a privilege for me"", said Annie Lennox about ""Nostalgia"". ""I really do want to be loved, but I'm also prepared to be hated"". That is one honest, true artist. One that I adore. And one that frustrates me by releasing new albums at such a slow pace that often makes me think that Eurythmics were all she ever did, and the sole reason I love her for. Thus, I find it difficult to slander her for releasing yet again another album of standards. But I cannot get excited, either. Just like 1994's ""Medusa"", ""Nostalgia"" is a set of favourite classics that really offers nothing much. In fact, this time around the selection of songs, often makes any new interpretation sound boxed (can anyone put a fresh spin on ""Summertime""?) which is unfair for an artist of such tremendous vocal skills. Gorgeous voice, strong personality, mesmerizing stage presence, all that have made Annie Lennox truly iconic, will never be forgotten. But ""Nostalgia"" is pretty much another forgettable affair (when was the last time anyone played ""Medusa""?). Being an avid Annie fan, I have purchased amazon's lavish exclusive casebound book edition, but I cannot but be honest and express my disappointment for an icon who appears like a dull diva. I will always stand by her, because I know she is a diva, period.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMWK4UCULBL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG63ACA#wasThisHelpful","RXMWK4UCULBL2","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been quite sometime since someone who is coming from a talent show, showed true artistry, and released an album not made to be massively consumed, but instead created with care, aiming to showcase material that is worthy of the artist's true potential. In Ella Henderson's case, that was somewhat inevitable. Choosing to sing one of her own songs in the 2012 UK X Factor auditions proved that she was in a different league, and as the show progressed, her talent shone through. She may not have won, but based on these songs, she is destined to enjoy the greatest success of any other fellow contestant. Her anticipated debut record is packed with beautifully crafted songs (all of which she co-writes), merging together a most enjoyable variety of styles. Even more impressive are her performances. Ella is a young girl turning into a woman, yet her voice is so full that is beyond anyone's expectations how she is bursting with genuine emotion, singing her heart out in the most engaging way. One can literally hear her voice break on the verge of tears, and cannot help but wonder of what's to come from her in the future, if she can already exhibit such fervour, and deliver with such consistency. I could argue that she is without doubt the best British reality show non-winner ever, and ""Chapter one"" is easily the best debut album from one. Take a look at her on the cover, and notice the little detail under her right eye; sure, that sign of a tear is intentional, but it is the subtlety with which it is portrayed that makes it special.

Using as cover art a photo of a man (drummer Larry Mullen) embracing the lower area of another man's semi-naked body (his son) can only be perceived as a suspiciously cheap trick to engender controversy rather than an artistic statement. Pretty ironic when the album in question is called ""Songs of innocence"", and it is by one of the biggest bands worldwide. Automatically installed directly to no less than 500 million people's music libraries, provided that they were Apple subcribers, ""SOI"" inevitably made history upon its release. And, although the songs were made available at no cost, it is no secret that this unprecedented move was part of a negotiated deal between the American technology giant and the band's label - one that is reported to worth $100 million. Going to your local record store to purchase your favourite album never seemed so last century. Songs of innocence, signs of innocence lost, no doubt.""I don't believe in free music, music is a sacrament."", were Bono's words on the day, making it all the more confusing. Actually, the power of the album is to be found within its sacramental atmosphere. It seems that the key to understanding and appreciating the new record, is to leave all names, facts, prejudice and hype aside. Because the songs on here are pretty good. Less textured musically and more sonically appealing than most of their recent efforts, the new album harkens back to the musical style of the early days. While it pays tribute to their musical inspirations, ""SOI"" is recalling the group members' youth in Ireland, being reflective of the band discovering themselves, finding their place in the world, and touching on their childhood experiences. Bono finally lays down his political megaphone, and writes personal and vulnerable lyrics that come across naturally, highlighting the emotive essence of the record.""Songs of innocence"" is not radical in the ways that ie ""Achtung baby!"" was, but it is personal, inspired, cohesive and enjoyable. It will not win U2 any new fans; in fact, the lack of ambition and innovation will probably disappoint some of the old ones. They grasped at success so tightly in the last decade, not realizing they had lost it. Here, they throw out their past conventions, focusing instead on what they do best, and producing a solid record in their catalogue. Former soul-less corporate rock gives place to a deeper, intimate concept record, one which is not likely to be remembered as their promised rebirth, stillit is fresh, honest, freed from political convictions. Presenting most of what was mostly missing from recent albums, U2 are proving that they can still be compelling when not crushed under the weight of their own ponderousness. It may not catapult them back to their status of the past, as one of the greatest rock bands around, but ""SOI"" is very welcome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30DUPDWS5FEKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI5RMLE#wasThisHelpful","R30DUPDWS5FEKL","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally released sporting a black and white photo depicting a bowing girl in front of what looked like an umbrella, ""Adore""'s reissue cover presents the complete picture frame in colour; the girl apears to be one of the petals of a blossomed red rose. How beautiful, indeed. The Smashing Pumpkins have always incorporated poetic elements in their work, but on ""Adore"" poetic they became. Whereas previous albums were more punchy and straight-forward affairs, on this, a dark, melancholic, melodic, introspective quality runs through each of the 16 songs, appropriately, as during that time the band were dealing with death and seperation (frontman Billy Corgan's mother's death, his divorce, the reunion with his father, asking drummer Jimmy Chamberlin to leave the band etc.). Experimenting with electronic sounds, fusing a '70s rock essence with '80s synth-sounds, and '90s techno-tempos was, indeed, a strange change in direction for the band, especially considering the phenomenal success of their multi-platinum and critically acclaimed previous 2 records.Despite being poorly received by critics and fans upon its 1998 release, ""Adore"" really attained the very same heights as the kicking ""Siamese dream"" and the magnificent ""Mellon collie and the infinite sadness"", despite sounding nothing like either of the two. Actualy, ""Adore"" is entirely different to any former or subsequent SP album. Even B. Corgan's signature angry scream here is replaced with a voice that sounds warm and human. Brimming with creativity and emotion, and transcending all expectations, this conceptual album was conceptualized in the most unexpected and alternative manner. Raw usually means hard, but it can also mean fine and beautiful; that is exactly what ""Adore"" is. Probably the most underrated rock album of the '90s, possibly one of the finest, the definition of true art (listening to the tinkly piano melody cut short in the end of the set will make you never forget them). This brand new reissue is a first-class opportunity to introduce/revisit the Smashing Pumpkins brilliance, they will effortlessly melt your heart, if you let it open. Mine is still bleeding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOMSCXMLU8SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MC79KSW#wasThisHelpful","RLOMSCXMLU8SM","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Released a few months after the sublime ""Born to die"", ""Paradise"" enhanced the mystery about the dark angel better known as Lana Del Rey. Being deeper, darker and dirtier than its predecessor, each of the EP's 8 songs is utterly mesmerising and addictive, making it a perfect companion to her glorious debut. ""Ride"", ""Cola"" and ""Gods and monsters"" are arguably the highlights, but the absolute standout track on here is the cinematic ""Body electric"", a euphoric, Bond-esque ode with compelling lyrics and a matching melody, inspired by the same-titled poem of American poet Walt Whitman. ""And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death"", he writes on ""Starting from Paumanok""; surely LDR identifies with him. Listening to these songs feels exactly as if death is the only salvation from the troubles of one's mortal existence. With this year's ""Ultraviolence"" (a diverse, slow-burner of an album) LDR proved that she is an adamant artist, but with ""Paradise"" she showed her artistic intentions. Her ""Paradise"" feels more like ""Paradise lost"". But it is heavenly, nevertheless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DE9IXZJK4EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LA1QW6#wasThisHelpful","R24DE9IXZJK4EX","A3K2J86VI3TJV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K2J86VI3TJV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This calendar has some of the must stunning photography I have seen on any calendar ever.  Each month features a vacation spot and highlights some of the best features of that place, also provides a tiny language lesson - basically how to say ""What's up?"" in the language of the place.Honestly, the spaces for each date could be larger.  Busy people might want to use another calendar to record their appointments.  However, this is the perfect calendar for our kitchen.  We basically use it to record vacations and other events involving the whole family (typically not more than one per day) - and also to have something beautiful to look at.

"This film wasn't easy to watch, and it commenced haunting me as soon as I had finished.It is in many ways a self-consciously arty film, from the 50s jazz score to the black and white cinematography, to the performances.  Based on a true situation (Dylan Thomas's reading tour in the US in the 1950s instigated by the academic John Malcolm Brinnin), the filmmaker has created settings and dialogue to enhance the situation of an alcoholic, brilliant Welsh poet pinballing between New York taprooms and the stuffiest Ivy League reading rooms.  Brinnin as played by a nearly unrecognizable Elijah Wood is frightfully uptight.  He has chosen to attach to the most volatile possible character to launch his academic fortune - a venture almost guaranteed to fail.  This movie has a sense of doom hanging over it from start to finish.  Even when Brinnin brings Thomas to his childhood vacation home in Connecticut to dry out and recharge in the 4 days between New York and a critical appearance at Yale, the mood is gloomy and menacing rather than serene.  In fact, I actually had to fast-forward during a wild evening with neighbors who were determined to one-up each other with horror stories.  (Side note:  the movie was actually filmed in Swansea, Wales, in 18 days.)It's no spoiler that Thomas's tour of the States could actually be viewed as successful, no thanks to Brinnin's efforts to contain his appetites.  This is a depressing story and no punches are pulled.  I don't need to watch it ever again, but like I said, it is haunting me.  It really is a very well-made movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSHTTU8LF1JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEUX2LE#wasThisHelpful","R3BSHTTU8LF1JW","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shelf isn't going to work for me.  I am giving it the same rating as the average of all the reviews to date.It's not that easy to tell from the picture, but this shelf is primarily a heavy plastic with stainless steel structural details.  It has a small surface so its functionality is limited.  I would not be confident to attach it with the waterproof glue included - have had too many shelves come crashing down in the middle of the night - and the tile in my shower defies the insertion of screws for the alternate mounting option.  It may work in some capacity other than the shower, I'm currently figuring that out.  As a ""luxury shower basket"" it is quite impractical and way overpriced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE17ZE7W9W8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHS14BQ#wasThisHelpful","RE17ZE7W9W8T","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little familiar with Richard Bausch, having read Thanksgiving Night.  I thought the plot summary of this book sounded quite compelling and I was excited to get a copy to read for the Amazon Vine program.  Considering that the Advance Reader's Copy is almost a year old at this point, I still thought maybe the general public just needs to be made more aware of Mr. Bausch's work.  Having finished the book, I think maybe they are aware of him and choose not to read his stuff.Natasha and Faulk are two of the most overwrought characters I can remember appearing together in the same book.  I would never diminish what happened to them - Faulk going through 9/11 in New York and Natasha's horrific experience in Jamaica, on top of not knowing whether her fiancé had died in the attack - but they both become so weak.  They go from attractive protagonists to complete victims, both of them.  And all that angst is so draining.  The effect is exacerbated by Bausch's cool, detached writing style.  I felt like he didn't have much compassion for his characters, his creations.  Natasha has her awful secret, and her friends and family are overwhelmingly worried about her, and she's just a mess.  Faulk's insecurity becomes his defining character trait.  He has the whole story written, in his head and on paper, of why she has withdrawn from him.  He keeps badgering her, she keeps withdrawing from him, and it's not pretty.  The booze is flowing, mostly down Faulk's throat.  They have moments of connection but it's really just a veneer of pretending things are okay, and that's as good as it gets between them.When The Talk finally takes place, Faulk is very drunk, and Natasha is distraught.  There is screaming and property damage.  The ending provides a shred of hope for the future.  I think you would have to be very gullible to hang on to that.Richard Bausch's writing style sometimes reminds me of John Cheever, whom I like quite a lot.  The difference between the two is humor.  Cheever always seemed to have a great deal of affection for his characters.  Sometimes Bausch seems like a boy pinning insects down to a board and observing them.Readability matters a lot to me and is the reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of three.  I was never bored - frustrated yes.  I think Bausch started with a very intriguing concept about the aftermath of 9/11.  I don't particularly care for the direction he took, but I'm not ready to give up on him yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYQFUVNFZT9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307266265#wasThisHelpful","R2VYQFUVNFZT9B","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a while since I was at school - we never had these cute shelves available.  I do have a locker at work, but mostly this struck me as a very versatile product and I wanted to try it in other places besides lockers.My husband made fun of it at first and urged me to take it to work, but it wasn't long before he found a use for it, plunking down a package (from Amazon) by the door to take upstairs on his next trip.  I am currently using it in our bathroom which is in the midst of remodeling, to keep a few items off the floor.  Eventually this locker shelf may make it to my place of business, where my workspace is in dire need of organization, or I may just buy another one.  In general I would classify this as one of those what-did-I ever-do-without-this products.  It is light and portable and provides that extra surface one needs so often, in addition to its organizational features.

"First impressions are important.  These towelettes, both the White Tea and the Peach Willow Bark, smell absolutely great and the initial contact is truly refreshing.  Unfortunately, that's all the good news about this product.The Peach Willow Bark towelettes are intended to exfoliate.  They are very mildly abrasive, not too harsh at all.  However, both towelettes leave a residue on my face.  Several minutes after application, my skin is sticky, and several hours later it is greasy.  I have a slightly oily T-zone but in general my skin is pretty dry.I do love the scents and will find a way to use them - probably as hand wipes after picnics - but I will not be purchasing additional product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1895B4AHEOSZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFN7SIG#wasThisHelpful","R1895B4AHEOSZV","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a Nerf expert, but luckily someone in my orbit is.  Unluckily for this product, he is probably not the target demographic for this particular model.Reading through the other reviews, I can see that a fair amount of adults also consider themselves Nerf aficionados, which means my son is in good company.  He takes his Nerf products very seriously and has tried the competition which, Hasbro/Nerf will be happy to know, falls short.  (It truly is Nerf or Nothin'!)However, this N-Strike SharpFire Blaster is his least favorite Nerf product.The different configurations including a holster get a thumbs-up.  Also it is a plus that the gun comes with 10 darts since they tend to get lost.  Unfortunately the plaudits stop there.The process of loading one dart at a time is tedious.  The gun does not have much power which makes it tough to aim.  This is an old-school model which has quite a bit of kid appeal but is just not sharp enough for more seasoned Nerf enthusiasts.  In all honesty, if I felt qualified to review the product on my own, I would probably give it 3 stars.  I suspect there are a lot of young'ns out there who are absolutely thrilled with this gun.  However, I know from personal experience that for the older demographic, it's not so great.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ROBT5NROZXB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD6KJXI#wasThisHelpful","R2ROBT5NROZXB5","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are fans of the TV series and glad that the show led us to these books.  The Tempe of the books is quite different from Tempe on the show.  In the books, Tempe splits her time between Montreal and North Carolina.  (Speaking in Bones takes place in NC).  In the books, Tempe lives alone and is the primary driver in solving cases, with the sporadic help of a few mildly eccentric law enforcement officials.  Tempe is divorced and in a rather complicated relationship with Montreal Police Detective Andrew Ryan.  Her most sustained relationship is with her cat Birdie.  Her mother Daisy and sister Harry make periodic appearances, but primarily Tempe is a solo act, and that's the beauty of it.  The reader gets to hang out with Tempe.Speaking in Bones tackles issues of backwoods fundamental religion and also cybersleuthing.  I learned a lot as per usual.  Kathy Reichs definitely does her research.  The plot progressed steadily, the book was tough to put down, and the ending was very satisfying.  (No spoilers, but Tempe spends most of the book avoiding both her tax accountant and Ryan's marriage proposal.)I love hanging out with Tempe and am always a little sad when the story comes to an end.  The Tempe of the books is less quirky than Bones on TV - maybe not quite so entertaining but still a very neat lady.  The spouse and I go back and forth whether books in a series can be read out of sequence.  He absolutely refuses to start a series in the middle.  I haven't read all of the Bones books but jumped at the chance to read this latest one, and I definitely think if you want to start reading about Bones here, well jump right in.  Reichs is excellent at providing just enough of the backstory.  I enjoyed Speaking in Bones every bit as much as any other book in the series, and it's a solid 5 stars for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDIQBF5YV1HAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544048#wasThisHelpful","RDIQBF5YV1HAG","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My old hair dryer was a Conair - I think.  It is so old that some of the markings have worn off, and it still works great.  This new dryer - I will call it the ""1875 Folding"" for short - appealed to me because of the folding handle feature.  I jumped at the chance to receive an 1875 Folding to review.First impression - it is noticeably lighter than my old dryer.  Second impression - the attachments actually stay attached!  With previous dryers the attachments would fall off and/or get tangled in my hair so I discarded them pretty quickly.  When I turned on the 1875 Folding with the concentrator attached, I was a bit disappointed.  The air flow on High was just not as powerful as expected.  I have long thick hair and usually go with high heat and high power.  This one was not blowing me away, so to speak.Overall this dryer just does not feel as solid as my old one.  I like that the dual heat and power controls are right next to each other on the handle.  They are easier to manipulate.  However, the plastic seems thinner and cheaper.  I suppose if you are going to do a folding handle, the handle itself will be lighter and feel flimsier.  The retractable cord does work great, which is a major consideration for me.  Personally, even with a folding handle, I would not travel with this dryer.  There are other dryers out there with folding handles (but not retractable cords) that are equally powerful and significantly smaller and lighter.  (Every ounce counts!)I like to finish off my hair drying session with the Air Curler (check it out, I think it's pretty awesome), and this is where the 1875 Folding earned an extra star.  Without the concentrator attachment, my hair swirled around in the Air Curler cylinder like crazy and dried/curled faster - an improvement on my old dryer which did a more than adequate job.  I may stick with the old dryer for Phase 1 of the drying, and use the 1875 Folding with the Air Curler.  A rather elaborate plan, considering my usual minimum-fuss approach - but hey, whatever works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TH6M3ZHWVDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W85ZOK6#wasThisHelpful","R15TH6M3ZHWVDD","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been watching the Longmire TV series and like it a lot, so I jumped at the chance to review this book for Amazon.  The spouse has already started reading the Longmire books from the beginning and recommends them highly.  However, I have never had a problem starting in the middle of a series.It undoubtedly helped to be familiar with the characters from TV, but the characters in the book are different.  There is no Branch.  Vic is different in appearance but not so much in her temperament.  Most notably, the character of Walt himself is very different in the book.  The TV series has quite a bit of humor but it is relatively subtle, and Walt's character is a straight-on, steely eyed Wyoming lawman.  The Walt Longmire of the books has a sense of humor.  He also does not hesitate to express emotion.  I like the book-Walt better.Candidly, the first part of the book seemed a little lighthearted.  The denizens of the courthouse are somewhat playing it for laughs.  It is an easy way for the reader to get to know the characters.  The imminent arrival of Walt's daughter Cady and her daughter Lola has everyone excited.  Yes, there is a death, and a mystery involving a poisoned Indian, dinosaur bones, and a visit from the FBI.  In typical fashion Walt is focused on solving the case while everyone around him is urging him to get things ready for his baby granddaughter's visit.  I don't want to spoil anything but just say that when Cady and Lola arrive, things get serious and the tone changes abruptly.  Walt really gets the chance to show his heart, and the story from there made me shed a few tears.Craig Johnson's writing style is very reader-friendly.  With so many distractions and reasons to put a book down and go do something else, this book made me want to stay curled up and turning pages.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and found the ending to be especially gratifying.  Now I am going to go back and start at the beginning of the series!Edited 5/4/15 to add:  Now having read the first four volumes in the series, I have to agree with other reviewers who suggested that the existence of the TV show has had an impact on the books, and not necessarily for the better.  Although I did enjoy Dry Bones and am keeping the 5-star rating (mostly for the ending), to me the earlier books are much richer.  It's like reading literature as opposed to pop fiction.  I would not go so far as to say the latest book seems dumbed down, but the earlier books definitely have a lot more depth.  Regardless, I am hooked on the series, will read it through to the end, including rereading Dry Bones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBIHDJ01YK0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426930#wasThisHelpful","RBBIHDJ01YK0X","A2UYGOYMV73826","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UYGOYMV73826?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 6 year old Chihuahua likes these Jerky Treats.  She doesn't seem overly excited for them but she eats them every time.They're a nice size for her.  I thought with them being called jerky, they would've been a bit tough and taken at least a few minutes to eat but they're actually pretty soft and easy to bite off pieces and chew.  My dog has them gone in about a minute.I like to think these treats are truly supporting her joints as stated.  Hard to say say for sure but something is better than nothing I'm sure.My dog digests these just fine and seems to like them just fine.  I would recommend giving them a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADTZ5S7ESWAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQYGSZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ADTZ5S7ESWAS","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice Flying Disc.  The dogs absolutely love playing with it.The disc is pretty large.  About 8"" across.  The disc is not flat.  It has a neat wavy edge which I think is nice because it makes it easier for the dogs to pick it up.The disc has a pretty good weight to it (about 10 ounces) so I'd say it's probably best for larger dogs only.  It flies pretty good but lands hard so I wouldn't want to worry about a smaller dog getting hit with it.The disc is very solid and durable.  It's holding up incredibly well.  The quality is great.  We have the Currant color option and love the color.I think this is an awesome disc for larger dogs and I would highly recommend it.This product was provided free of charge for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1183EV66MEIJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RUZC4I#wasThisHelpful","R1183EV66MEIJK","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is pretty fun.  We've just played it with those of us in our household so far and that includes my husband, 14-year-old daughter, 12-year-old son and myself.  The kids enjoy it way more than mom and dad but we don't think it's bad.  They just happen to think it's incredible.The game is very fast and easy to learn.  There's nothing complicated at all in figuring it out.You choose somebody to be the Guesser.  This person draws a card and silently reads the ""dilemma"" that matches the color of space that their ""mover"" is on.  They then take the Dilemma Dial and lock in their choice of what they think the other players will choose.  The Guesser will then read the dilemma out loud to the other players and those players will discuss it and come up with an answer.  If their choice matches the Guesser's choice, the Guesser gets to move forward but if it doesn't match, they may have to move backwards.  It's then the next player's turn to be the Guesser.The Dilemma Dial has 4 options on it.  I KNOW they will choose A/B and I THINK they will choose A/B.  The 2 KNOW options will either allow you to move forward 3 spaces when correct or make you move back 2 spaces if incorrect.  The 2 THINK options will only move you 1 space forward if correct but if incorrect, you don't have to move backwards at all.  You stay put.There are 3 types of cards in the mix.  They all get shuffled together.  The main cards are coded blue and titled Would You Rather...?  This is what I described above.  The other 2 types of cards are quite a bit less and have different playing instructions.  The green coded ones are titled Would You Rather...Blank?  These cards have words in brackets that need filled in from the other players.  You may have to tell them to name a body part before you can fill in the blank.  This allows for some creative fun.  The 3rd type of card is the red coded ones that are titled Would You Rather...Challenge?  This card basically requires the Guesser to choose A or B and fight their case for why that one should be chose and then they have to choose another player to fight for the opposite option.  The other players not in the debate choose who was most convincing.  These can be fun but they can be dull too.  We had one that said High Five or Low Five.  How boring!  Anyway, the winner of this gets to move forward 3 spaces.Overall this game can be pretty fun and entertaining.  We've played a few games and I should point out that it's much better when you have an even number of players because when players are split on their choices and don't want to budge, it can be pretty long and drawn out.  Some of our games have lasted a really long time.One thing I didn't get was the fact that the card holder wasn't big enough to hold all of the cards.  Not a huge deal but it just doesn't make sense.Some of the cards are gross, some funny, some just plain dumb and some head scratching.  With 160 cards and 5 dilemmas per card, that's a lot of dilemmas.  It won't get repetitive for a long time.  We haven't really come across anything yet that I didn't think wasn't kid appropriate.  I think this game is just find for kids 12 and up.  Probably geared for those 12-16.  My kids love it.  I'd recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MC59Z6F85562/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGR5G3U#wasThisHelpful","R2MC59Z6F85562","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved this book, especially the first half.  I had an incredibly hard time putting it down and when I did, I couldn't quit thinking about it.  I think I even dreamed about it a couple nights.  It was so suspenseful and terrifying.I instantly felt drawn to the girls and my heart couldn't help but go out to them.  I couldn't wait to see what they would do and how they would move on from every bad luck situation that they encountered.  They were hit with one thing after another and just when you'd think their poor lives couldn't get any worse, they did.  I even shed some tears along the way which is very rare for me.This was a well written story that will stick with me for a very long time.  It's the 4th book that I've read from this author.  I didn't think I'd find one as good as Still Missing but this one is right up there with it.

"The Cups that I received are a little different than what's shown in the picture.  The design/pattern is different and the bag states NOW CRACK RESISTANT.  My guess is they tried to redesign the cups and make them better but they're actually worse.The main problem is the fact that the white rims are chipping so that you see blue underneath the white.  It looks like paint chipping.  There's little flakes of white all over the cups.  It's not just a few of them, it's all of them.  This is how they arrived.  I would want to thoroughly rinse each and every cup inside and out before letting anyone drink out of them.  That can't be good to swallow plastic flakes.Aside from the chipping issues, the cups are very flimsy.  They're really thin and they bend and make cracking sounds way to easily.  They may be crack resistant but you'd think they'd feel sturdy in your hand, not less sturdy.These cups are more of a teal blue or pool water blue.  A pretty color.  For some reason I was expecting a dark blue color but they're not.  Just an FYI for those who are looking for a specific shade of color.The cups work fine but after a good rinse out and wipe down but that kind of defeats the purpose of disposable cups.  I'm not fond of these cups and wouldn't recommend this particular set.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5DZPA9O4TGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y0FJMI#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5DZPA9O4TGR","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is a pretty nice Panasonic Shaver System.  It comes complete with a self-cleaning station.This shaver can be used on both wet and dry skin.  I think it provides a really close shave with minimal irritation (sensitive skin) that leaves the skin soft and smooth.  The shaving process seems to be a bit slower with this shaver as compared to previous shavers.  It’s not bad, just slower.This shaver runs really fast and strong but it’s actually quite a bit quieter than most shavers that I’ve come across.  The cleaning station is pretty quiet too.  The last one I used was pretty loud, this one isn’t bad at all.The cleaning station also doubles as the charging station.  You simply fill the water tank and dump in a pack of detergent.  1 pack is included and it should last for about a month.  After you’re done shaving you place the shaver into the station and press a button to start the cleaning process.  The shaver will be cleaned, dried and charged.  In my house this shaver is always placed on the charging/cleaning station after use so it’s always fully charged, cleaned and ready to go.I think this is a really nice system.  I would rate it 4  stars and recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVKT8TXD4NL70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","RVKT8TXD4NL70","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Toy Breed Adult option and we have 2 Chihuahuas who love this food.  One of them is about 16 years old and has had all of her teeth removed so the smaller the pieces the better in my opinion.  These pieces are very easy for her to chew and eat.  These pieces are incredibly small.  Probably the smallest pieces of dog food I've ever seen.Both dogs will choose this food over others when mixed together.  They seek out these pieces and pull them out to eat.  They digest the food well and seem to really enjoy it.I like the bag that this food comes in because it's resealable.

"I think this is a really great binder. It has several different features that I really like.This is a 2"" zippered binder that has an optional shoulder strap for carrying that's adjustable.At the front of the binder there is a prong closure flap that opens to a small zippered pocket that is great for pencils and other writing utensils.  Below that is another softly lined and padded pocket that's great for electronic devices such as iPad's, Kindles or other tablets or reading devices.When you open the binder you have a vertical 5-Tab/6-Pocket expanding file behind the front cover.  Colored tab inserts are included.  There is a velcro strap to help keep the contents in place.The 3 ring fixture is mounted on a large flat plastic surface that can actually be removed from the binder if desired.  This plastic portion is inserted in an open pocket on the inside of the back cover.  580 sheets is the capacity of this binder.This binder great quality and seems pretty durable.  It's stated that you can fold back the front cover to maximize desk space but I feel as though I'm going to break something if I try to force it so we've chosen not to do this.I think this is a great binder and if this is the type of thing you're looking for then I would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLOPT19TQAKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NS2LG#wasThisHelpful","R1GLOPT19TQAKM","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think this is a really great Desk Lamp.  I use it on my bedside table and it's perfect.This lamp is nice and tall but the base is small enough that's it doesn't take up too much room.  It can be folded up when not in use so it's pretty compact and saves space.  The arm and head are both adjustable so they can be angled many different ways and the head itself is rotatable too so you can shine the light right where you need it.The light can be very dim or very bright.  There's 4 pre-set modes that you can choose from.  Study, Read, Relax and Sleep.  Each one has a little image to represent it so it's fast and easy to select what you want.  Aside from those 4 modes, you also have a plus and minus button so you can adjust it to any level you choose.  I do a lot of reading in bed so I like being able to adjust the light to what works best.  I also make a nightly trip to the restroom so it's nice to be able to turn a light on dim so it doesn't bug my husband but gives me enough light so that I'm not stumbling around in the dark.  When I need a brighter light, I have that option too.  It can pretty much light up most of my bedroom if I need it to.This lamp also has a USB charging port which is very handy for me.  I always have my iPad, Kindle and Cell Phone on my night stand so it's nice to be able to charge any of them overnight should I need to.The quality of this lamp is excellent.

"I think this is a nice Paper Shredder.  It can shred up to 8 sheets of paper at a time and although there's not a designated slot for credit cards, you can still shred them in the main shredder.This shredder is really easy to use.  The only button is the power button which you simply slide to forward or reverse shredding.  You can shred up to 200 sheets before you need to let the motor cool down.The shredder is nice and powerful and it cuts perfectly.  Shredding is pretty fast and effortless.  For a shredder, it's pretty quiet.  Much quieter than any other shredder I've used in the past.  The size is nice, it fits right under my computer desk and doesn't stand out or look bad.The basket can hold a good amount of paper shreds but when you need to empty it it's really easy.

At the back of the handle there's a small red square on the left and a blue square on the right to remind you which side is hot and which side is cold should you, guests or kids need it.  The water comes out in a nice, wider spray which I really like.  It's powerful but not overly so.My husband installed this faucet in about an hour.  He's installed a few faucets over the years and says this one wasn't harder than any of the others.  Pretty much everything was included that was needed except for a couple standard tools and things that most men will already have.I think this faucet is awesome and I would highly recommend it.  We're very pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIJHK3W35WPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIB6EJO#wasThisHelpful","R2NIJHK3W35WPB","A1ITRGMT80D5TK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITRGMT80D5TK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This collection of Zahn's work is a nice mix of sci/fi and fantasy.Good short stories are hard to write and Zahn does an admirable job of making his writing unpredictable. It's nice to be able to read a story in one sitting and like any collecton, some of his stories are better than others. For the most part though, these are ""A' stories with a few ""B""s mixed in. I like an anthology like this. It comes in handy at doctor's offices and before bedtime. Zahn's ""Pawn's Gambit"" was my favorite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI554G8N6ZMKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150401622X#wasThisHelpful","RI554G8N6ZMKQ","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So great is Tomas’s grief at losing his mistress and their young child that he turns his back on the world and God. He symbolizes his displeasure by walking backwards. One day he finds the journal of  Father Ulisses, a Catholic priest stationed in Angola.  Father Ulisses's journal describes the cruelty of slavery and the church’s indifference to the slaves’ plight. He confronts the church hierarchy and gets excommunicated for his efforts. Disillusioned with Christianity, Ulisses carves a cross that symbolizes his feelings. Tomas becomes obsessed with finding this crucifix. He borrows his uncle’s horseless carriage and drives to the “High Mountains of Portugal.” The descriptions of his troubles with the car are hilarious and pitiful at the same time. During his trip, Tomas unwittingly runs over a young boy with the car, this deepens his sorrow. At the end of his journey Tomas comes to a startling conclusion about Christianity and so concludes the 1st part of the novel.The 2nd part of the book describes a pathologist’s conversation with his dead wife. She explains her version of Christianity as an Agatha ""Christ""ie novel. Next, a mysterious woman visits the pathologist with a suitcase containing her dead husband. This is Rafael, the devout father of the boy Tomas killed.  The father neglected to keep track of his son and later found him dead in the roadway. His wife wants an autopsy performed. Her husband was so filled with self loathing and guilt that the autopsy reveals his extremities are filled with vomit. A chimpanzee is also found inside of the man. Is this intended to be the embodiment of Christ?In the final part of the book, the great nephew of Rafael moves back to the small Portugal village where Tomas killed the boy. The Canadian is accompanied by a chimp who teaches him to live in the present and enjoy just “being.” The three parts of the novel are intricately related by geography and ancestory. The reader gets to decide if they succeed in bringing about a revelation or if the novel is simply the fantastical musings of the writer.The High Mountains of Portugal is an allegorical novel that examines faith and Christianity. It is thought provoking and profound. I enjoyed the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHLJ1SM4JMARD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997174#wasThisHelpful","RHLJ1SM4JMARD","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Anna and the Swallow Man. It's a great story, well told. As happened so many times during the Holocaust, Anna's father leaves home one day never to return. Suddenly, the people Anna once knew become distant and unwilling to help. Locked out of her apartment, she has no way to get food or shelter. In desperation, she chances upon a stranger called the Swallow Man. He takes her under his wing and together, they navigate war torn Poland and Russia trying to stay alive and away from those who would harm them. The plot moves quickly. I recieved the book one day and had it read the next.This would make a great companion book for Anne Frank and it's written for the age group that usually studies the play. It would also be a great book to teach inferences. I would recommend it for the more advanced, mature reader. I have read so many books that I tend to read with detachment, but I can imagine a young girl reading this with a sense of wonder and mystery. According to Erin Clarke. the book's senior editor, ""It reveals life's hardest lessons while celebrating its miraculous possibilites."" I couldn't  agree more. It would make a great book to read together with your daughter or son so that you can discuss the many themes found in this marvelous story. Reading the book was a great experience, sharing it with someone else would make it even better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDDE6MU4NSM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553513346#wasThisHelpful","REDDE6MU4NSM6","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Benincasa lets it rip in DC Trip. She writes with no inhibitions or filters. This is raw Amy Schumer humor with a high school field trip setting.

"This is a beautiful, stylish watch. According to the band size, face circumference, and looks I also think it is designed for a man. The band was way too big for my wife and by comparing it to other Invicta watches, it is either a unisex piece or designed for a man. Any woman thinking about buying it should know that she'll have to have the band adjusted which is a pain in the sitty down.I received the watch for an honest review and I hope this information is helpful.

"This book couldn’t be more timely. There was a news sensation last week when a United States destroyer sailed within twelve miles of the reefs in the South China Sea. These reefs have been developed into Chinese islands with airfields and harbors. China issued grave warnings about the consequences of the so called “invasion”.  This book explains China’s outrage.In the recent Democratic presidential debate, Jim Webb, who has served as a United States Senator from Virginia, Secretary of the Navy, and an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration was asked what he thought was the greatest threat to our nation and he replied, “China”. Peter Navarro’s extensively researched book, Crouching Tiger, explains why there is need for concern and what can be done to counteract China’s rise to power.The book starts by describing China’s one hundred years of humiliation. It has been invaded and exploited by many western nations, including the United Sates, and was brutally occupied by the Japanese before and during WWII. China’s militarization is a product of the distrust caused by these incursions and their desire to become a predominant world power in the Far East.The book goes on to assess China’s military capabilities, its efforts to gain American technology, and its relationships with other Asian nations. It also describes China’s efforts to gain hegemony over East Asia and renationalize Taiwan. The final part of the book explains what might trigger a war with China and what the Unites States can do to preserve the peace.Navarro is a master at condensing mountains of research into a very readable, and more importantly, understandable account of the Sino/American relationship. I received an electronic copy of the book and wasn’t going to read it until I received a hard copy, but I opened the file, read the first few lines and before I knew it had the book read. It is a fascinating look at the most populous nation in the world and one whose economy has now surpassed the GDP of the United States. It raises the question of whether or not China will now surpass us in military might and world influence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SEU6NLAYMINS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633881148#wasThisHelpful","R2SEU6NLAYMINS","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first put these on as I was watching television so I could  adjust the band and see if they fit. The noise reduction was so good I could barely hear the T.V. Next, I used them with my I-Pod when I went for my walk. Compared to my fairly expensive earbuds, these had a much clearer, defined sound. Finally, I compared them to my other headphones. I listened to three songs with those on and my ears hurt afterwards. Next, I tried the Sentey headphones. They are so much more comfortable. The earpieces fit around the ear better and they are better padded. The sound was substantially better also with more bass and better clarity of sound.

"This is a book for those of you who are still operating under the myth that if you can just find the right person to love, you'll be happy. Both authors state that you have to learn to love yourself first before you can love others. One must stay in the moment and shed expectations to enjoy another person.Lodro explains how to approach relationships from a Buddhist perspective and Meggan uses Gnostic Christianity to explain giving and receiving love. Both of them provide valid, easy to understand concepts about relationships. The practical advice they give is sure to increase a person's self-awareness and provides a pathway to develop deeper more lasting, satisfying human relationships.

"The appreciation of art such as this painting of a pug is, of course, totally subjective. The expressive eyes,vibrant colors, and the fact that I love dogs attracted me to this work of art. It added a burst of color to the wall adjacent to our kitchen. The painting is a reproduction done on 100% canvas, hand stretched on a pine frame. It was easy to hang with a push pin. I've had the piece up for over a week and it has begun to grow on me. I used it to replace a poster an aerial view of the Boise State blue football turf with orange suited players. (My wife made me take it down.) She was out of town when I hung this up and when she came home and saw the pug she wasn't pleased. I'm hoping it will grow on her. I whimpered and went belly up with my paws in the air pleading to keep the painting. (I told her it's a reminder to eat healthy.) So far it's worked.

"I saw Conner and Cayden Long's story in a television news piece, so I was intrigued to discover a book had been written by their mother. The book didn't disappoint.  ""Expect A Miracle"" inspires with its story of Jenny Long's struggle to find her place in the world and provide her children with the unconditonal love she received from her mother. Jenny's soul was forged in the fire of mistakes and adversity and she rises above them to become an inspiration for others, but that is just one part of the story. She gives birth to two sons, Conner her eldest, and Cayden, a special needs child with spastic cerebral palsy. Advised to institutionalize Cayden, Jenny shunned medical opinion and along with her husband, Jeff, decides to bring Cayden home and provide him with all the love and care she can muster. Along the way, she discovers what a prince her son Conner is. Conner devises a way to share a sport with his brother. The boys enter a kid's triathalon as a team and, unwittingly, they become a nationwide phenomenon. To truly appreciate their story you need to read this book. At an awards ceremony to honor the boys, a documentary was shown that described Connor's efforts to love and care for his brother. After viewing it Lebron James said, ""I don't have to preach anymore. I can just show my older son what he can do for his brother."" His sentiment moved me to tears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KN0IKE6YZD65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618931288#wasThisHelpful","R2KN0IKE6YZD65","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The United States Constitution states that all of its citizens have the right to a fair and speedy trial and that no cruel or unusual punishment will be administered. Buser's book points out that for the poor and disenfranchised, especially blacks and Latinos, this isn't the case. Many inmates of Ryker Island end up there because they can't make bail. The court system of New York City is inundated with cases and so a Ryker's Island detainee can wait months for his or her case to be heard. By the time they do make it to court, it's often easier and wiser to plead guilty to a crime they may or might not have comitted. While they are in Ryker's they are often beaten, terrorized by other inmates, or put in solitary confinement. After weeks or months of cruel and unusual punishment, the only thing they can think of is how to get off the island. Buser does a good job of pointing out the failings of our justice system. She starts her career as someone who cares and tries to make a difference for those she comes into contact with, but budget cuts and bureaucracy wear her down and make her job impossible. Her account is written in clear, easy to read prose. It explains why there is so much upheaval in places like Ferguson and Cleveland and gives the reader a deeper understanding of some the injustices minorities face. A more in depth look at the gap between the haves and have nots in our country can be found in Matt Taibbi's book The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OKMCC1Q6KI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077842#wasThisHelpful","R25OKMCC1Q6KI4","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am pleasantly surprised at how good the food I cook on this is. I made pork rib shishkebobs with fresh garden vegetables and they were fantastic! The next night I loaded the grill with boneless/skinless chicken breasts, chicken shishkebobs with vegetables, and veggie foils. Everything came out great and the skinless chicken never stuck to the grill.Clean-up is easy. The grill pops off and I put it in the sink with the female part of the plugin facing up. Most of the residue came off when I sprayed it with warm water. The rest disappeared after I used dish soap and a dish rag.The grill heats up quickly and cooks the food evenly.Amazon double packed the grill so none of the plastic parts were broken. I put it together as I watched television. It is light and can easily be carried to wherever you need it. The grill costs less than half of what I paid for my gas grill and when you add in the cost of propane, using the Foreman grill becomes even more economical.

"I got this for my wife. She drives back and forth to Boise, Idaho which is 170 miles away and wanted a container she could re-use. It cuts down on buying bottled drinks and the resulting empty plastic containers.She can't tip her head back to use a regular go-cup and needed something with a straw. This is extra tall, but it fits nicely into her Subaru Outback's cup holders and holds 20 oz. of beverage. However, it's too tall for the cup holders in my Corolla (not that she would deign to ride in a 1998 Classic). The nice thing about this is that she can buy a Diet Coke, add lots of ice, and it stays cold. I also fill it with filtered water when she's home. I recommend that everyone drink only filtered water to ensure they are eliminating the carcinogens found in water sources across the country.This is BPA free, heavy duty pastic that will not leech chemicals into your water like a lot of bottled water will when exposed to the sun.

"Deceit describes the people and the manipulations involved in a merger between two corporations with competing technologies and the hedge fund that engineers the merger. Most of the players involved set aside their ethics and use underhanded tactics to position themselves and their businesses advantageously. Garrett Carlssen, who helped develop the technology that allows computers to read and record information from bar codes which both companies use, observes as the players from all three firms play the game of greed and corruption involved in corporate takeovers.Adelson writes his account with the insight of someone who writes of what he knows. His characters are well defined and their motivations explained. The novel includes the subplot of a relationship between Anne Mills, who works for the hedge fund, and Carlssen. She comes to regret her unethical actions as she realizes money can't buy happiness and actions have consequences. This adds spice to the story.This is a good story that lacks focus. Abdrupt changes in point of view and anecdotes that don't advanced the plot slow the novel down and make it less readable, but, all in all, I enjoyed this tale of Wall Street.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K12IEZ33AOO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692239561#wasThisHelpful","R3K12IEZ33AOO6","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed my romp through small town America. Cobb's writing is simple and easy to  read. He populates his story with a small town sheriff who works for the benefit of the community, young adults who drink, do drugs and carouse, and a protege Sheriff Gordon trains and hires. When a horrible accident, caused by a hit run driver, takes the life of one of the town's trouble causers while he is being arrested, the corrupt town council chairman uses the incident for political gain at the expense of the arresting officer, Ronny Forbert. The consequences divide the community and produce catastrophic results. The novel provides a snapshot of a dying town with little economic opportunity and the effect it has on young lower class citizens.For me, the flaw in the novel is the lack of develpment of Ronny Forbert. The author fails to paint the picture of someone capable of doing what he does. The novel somehow seemed incomplete and the ending was unsatisfying, but it was still well worth the read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFGYBGYBPGJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062391240#wasThisHelpful","R2FFGYBGYBPGJH","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Untwined tells of identical twins whose fingers were entwined while in the womb. The delivering doctor had to “untwine” their fingers before their mother could give birth to them. The two girls, Isabelle and Giselle, are as close as any identical twins could possibly be until a horrific car accident leaves one dead and the other in coma. As the surviving twin lies comatose she remembers their shared past.This poignant account, written in present tense, tells of their high school days and experiences with their family and friends. Danticat explores the surviving twin’s loss of her carbon copy sister, her sole mate and friend.

"This is a nice looking, medium weight pan of sound construction. You can fry anything you want in this pan without oil and it will not stick. I fried two 85% lean hamburgers, dumped a half can of Nalley's chili on top of them when they were done and topped the whole thing with cheese which melted to the bottom of the pan and the whole concoction  slid out of the pan without leaving anything behind. So this is a great pan for braising.The manufacturer recommends using butter or a little oil, no EVO and no cooking sprays, when you fry and to use low to medium heat. So when I tried to brown some hashbrowns, it didn't work even though I used butter and oil and turned the heat up. When I tried to fry two eggs easy over, I couldn't get under them to turn them over. I had to chase one of the eggs clear across the pan and trap it on the edge where it bunched up into a ball. So this is a great pan for cooking things  a certain way and I'm sure with a little practice I'll be flipping eggs like a short order cook. It's also reasonably priced. 9/30/2015 The more I use this pan the better I like it.

"Wright uses the personal story of an Incan intrepreter, Waman, to describe the Spanish conquest of the Incan empire. Waman is kidnapped at sea by the conquistadors and is forced to become Pizarro's translator. Through his eyes we view the great Incan Empire with its massive fortresses, palaces, terraces and canals. Wright draws on historical accounts to paint the portrait of an accomplished civilisation both in its achievements and in the way it treats its citizens, that is, until the Spanish invade.Pizarro, inspired by the riches Cortez brought back to Spain, is financed by the Spanish crown to find and conquer this land. Spurred by greed, these ""Gold Eaters"", as they are referred to by the Incas, launch a brutal, ruthless, campaign to subjugate the Incas. Wright's descriptions of the atrocities committed in the name of Chritianity are vivid and bloody. His use of Waman as someone who has a foot in both cultures allows him to compare the religions and customs of both worlds in a very effective way. Wirght adds flesh to his historical account by following Waman as he lives among both the Incas and Spaniards and seeks to reunite with his childhood friend and mother.I'm a big historical fiction fan and while Gold Eaters isn't a fast moving barn buster, it is a novel that explores the Spanish conquest of the Incan Empire in a profound and historically acurrate way. Wright would have had to immerse himself in the history of Peru for years to write such a descriptive account of the customs and daily life of the Incas and I applaud his effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WK1CXXSMBSYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634629#wasThisHelpful","R2WK1CXXSMBSYF","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zero World takes you on a roller coaster ride of action and intrigue. Imagine a spy whose memory is cleared after each mission, who has no remorse, whose sole purpose is to complete his mission, who has an implant that enhances his physical and mental capacities and you have the perfect recipe for an assasin called Peter Caswell. After each mission his memory is reset and he is sent on another mission. These missions have a time limit and Caswell always kills his target on schedule until one day he fails. This failure leads him on a journey of discovery that ultimately causes him to seek the truth about who is and who he is working for and what their purpose is.This is a fast paced thriller that keeps the reader turning pages until the last word.

"A year or two after Holes came out I was teaching an advanced L.A. class (8th grade) and I asked how many hadn't read the book and 2/3 of them raised their hand. When I asked why, they said their teachers wouldn't let them because it was below their reading level. With a little wrangling, I managed to get a classoom set and we tried to read the book together. A few of them took the book home and read it that night and all of them loved it.Fuzzy Mud is also a good read. I particularly like the way Sachar explores the exponential increase of living organisms and the stress it puts on the environment. Sachar plants the seeds of knowledge in a good story about bullying and peer pressure. The story succeeds. This is an easy to read book with great themes and I highly reccomend it. Sachar's novels appeal to both avid and reluctant young readers and, if I could, I'd give him a pass straight to heaven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LNWCMK01BMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743785#wasThisHelpful","R39LNWCMK01BMQ","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Survive the Night is written for someone with a child-like understanding of the world but contains adult themes of drug use, sex, and murder so I’m not sure who the audience for this book would be. The author fails to establish a believability that would appeal to a more mature audience because it fails to develop a logical, coherent story which leads me to believe it must be written for junior high or high school kids.A group of six teenagers finds its way to a party in the New York subway where no one can leave until the next day.  A free spirit named Shana slips her best friend, Casey, some type of drug. When Casey gets separated from the everyone and finds another member of the group gutted and dead, she goes back and tells the rest of their friends and they embark on a search. Finding nothing they assume Casey is hallucinating. The group ends up hopelessly lost in a labyrinth of tunnels where a tentacled creature kills one after another of them after they do one stupid thing after another to escape, kind of like the Geico commercial with the chain saws.The book is written in present tense, first person, I’m assuming to make the reader wander if Casey was hallucinating or if all the fantastic events really happened. The writing is good enough to keep you reading, but again, when you find out Casey was given Ecstasy which, to the best of my knowledge, doesn’t cause hallucinations, the author loses her last shred of credibility. This book reminded me of a teenager writing for other teenagers and the hospital scene at the end of the book had me rolling my eyes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XW8TE0AY69N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595147241#wasThisHelpful","R37XW8TE0AY69N","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Minor's Stir Fry sauce has a nice balance of sweet and heat. I poured a cup of it over four quarts of stir fried vegetables and chicken and found the stir fry tasty. It's kind of like a hamburger helper for vegetables and I'm thinking it might help families get their children to eat veggies. I used wild asparagus, a red pepper, snow peas, carrots, celery, and a white onion in mine with sauteed chicken and served it over noodles. The sauce can also be used as a marinade or a basting sauce.At 71 oz. there is enough sauce to feed an army which means there's going to be a lot left over after your initial use. If this doesn't keep in the refirgerator, I wouldn't buy it unless you have an army of people to feed.

"Imagine being on an extremely advanced spaceship regulated almost totally by a computer that you helped design. Now imagine being infiltrated by another spaceship whose mercenaries have introduced a virus that messes up said computer so that it doesn't function properly but seemingly has a mind of its own. This is the premise of Lightless. The computer scientist, Althea, has a natural bond with Ananke, the computer she was instrumental in creating. The ""System"", a ruthless interstellar government that will destroy anything and anyone who dares defy it, has manned the ship with three people, including Althea, who are blindly loyal to the System. The infiltrators, who are working for  those who want to overthrow the System's government, unwittingly  use a program that changes the Ananke in a profound way so that they can use the ship for their own purposes. Althea's efforts to fix her computer so that the surveilance cameras and life support systems work properly prove fruitless and her frustrations mount. When one of the infiltrators is caught, an ""investigator"" is sent to unravel the intrigue and the reader observes as the plot twists and turns until it reaches its ultimate conclusion. The read is quick and over too soon.Lightless is an exploration of Artificial Intelligence and the ramifications of intelligence without compassion or ethics.  It helped me understand Steven Hawking's concern about making a machine sentient. I applaud C.A. Higgins for an extremely enjoyable, thought-provoking read.

"Virtues Of War is a Star Wars, action packed, space battle novel. Terra comes under attack when the Centauri colonies rebel. The novel centers on three characters as they are thrown together by the war. Coles develops their personalities well and science takes a backseat to action as the fleets of spaceships bombard each other. Just when Earth is most threatened, the trio plays a key role in the Expeditionary Force's efforts to quell the rebellion. The reader is propelled forward as the very existence of our main characters and Earth itself is threatened.While I enjoyed the book, it would have been better if I knew why the Centauris were rebelling. Usually a rebellion involves mistreatment by the imperial government and I had to hope I wasn't rooting for the wrong side. Also, Coles used too many acronyms. Their use impeded the flow of the writing. A reader would enhance their experience by listing each acronym and what it stands for on a book marker for a quick reference.

"The writing In the Language of Miracles flows like warm honey. I was reading a military science fiction novel when this came. I read the first few pages of Miracles and the writing and the story drew me in like a good book should. Rajia Hassib tells the story of an Egyptian family whose son has committed an unforgivable crime. Because they are Muslim, the whole family is blamed and vilified through social media and the two children are shunned at school. Their lives are put on hold as they seek to deal with a horrible tragedy that has alienated them from a community that already viewed them as suspect. The family is torn apart as the blame and guilt often causes the family members to turn on each other.Hassib's story is not only a study in character but also in culture. Each chapter starts with a quote from the western world and a corresponding quote from the middle eastern or Arabic culture. By showing how Arabic and Western beliefs are similar and developing empathy for her Egyptian characters as they deal with the hate and rejection of the community, Hassib demonstrates how we are more alike than we are different. I very much enjoyed the book as it explored scapegoating the family for a brutal act committed by one of its members.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N11IQWVL083Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525428135#wasThisHelpful","R1N11IQWVL083Q","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iceberg Slim is the result of ten years of research and interviews by Justin Gifford, PhD., an associate professor of English literature at the University of Nevada.  The book is far more than a biography of Robert Beck, a pimp, who operated in the 1940s and `50s. It is also a historical and sociological examination of black culture and countercultural from the 1900s until the Watts riots of the early 90s. As such, it helps explain contemporary black minority culture as it relates to the dominate white institutions of government and law enforcement. According to Gifford, by 1990 one quarter of all young black men were in prison, on parole, or under surveillance by the justice system and almost half of the prison population was black. Opportunities to make a living were few outside the sex trade or drugs. These circumstances closely parallel the plight of today's inner city blacks. According to Time magazine, in Baltimore ""one in four juveniles was arrested from 2005 to 2009.""Thus it was that Beck's role models in his formative years were the black males who dressed well and drove nice cars. These were the pimps, bootleggers and drug dealers. Beck says that he was ""street poisoned"" by the promise of easy money and sex. In and out of prison, he interviewed other pimps to learn his trade. When he ends up in Leavenworth Prison, Beck reads voraciously and was heavily influenced by Karl Menninger's The Human Mind and the idea that ""the absence of parental affection accounted for much criminal behavior."" His knowledge of psychology increased his skills at manipulating women into prostitution and he becomes a highly successful pimp. Eventually a reoccurring dream about his mother and his guilty conscience convince him to quit the trade.Eventually, Beck becomes a writer and gains fame and adulation by writing his most famous work `Pimp"", a work widely read by the black counterculture but mostly ignored by Caucasians. He dies during the Watts riots of 1992 hoping that the black revolution had finally begun.Iceberg Slim explains Robert Beck in the context of the historical times in which he lived. Reading the book gave me a deeper understanding of today's race relations. In a 1967 speech, Martin Luther King Jr. pointed out that America is facing a triple threat of racism, poverty, and militarism. In a Time editorial written last week, Tavis Smiley asserts that these problems still threaten our democracy. He says, ""Protest and riots-uprisings- could become the new normal,"" if these issues aren't addressed. Gifford's book shows us how a society produces an ""Iceberg Slim"" and reminds us that many inner city blacks have suffered for decades under the yoke of poverty, lack of opportunity, and injustice.This book has explicit language and content that some might find offensive, but it is an honest, no holds barred account of Robert Beck's life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20NWI0CMINIKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538340#wasThisHelpful","R20NWI0CMINIKG","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keret writes in the tradition of Jewish humorists like Isaac Bashevis Singer who once famously said, ""Life is God's novel let him write it."" While Keret has a more secular, modern point of view, his stories and humor are decidedly Jewish.

It would make a great companion for a plane trip or a wait at the hospital. My favorite part is when he is demoted to a yoga class of pregnant women.

"In the Nazi's heinous attempt to eradicate European Jews, they invaded Poland and herded Polish Jews from around the country into the Warsaw Ghetto. This book follows Aron and his family as they are herded, like cattle to the slaughter, into the Ghetto. Only they are not slaughtered, that would have been too merciful, rather they are forced to starve, to scrounge for food and water, to watch their fellow Jews be beaten and shot on the whim of their Nazi persecutors. They are forced to watch brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers die or be killed. Jim Shepard's book is an accurate portrayal of this brutish, hellish barbarism.The story is told through the eyes of Aron, a small child who doesn't fully grasp what is happening. He and his friends become smugglers to bring food and goods to the Ghetto for trade and barter helping their families survive. Aron is forced to make several Sophie Choices, something no child should have to do. After his mother dies, he ends up in an orphanage run by Janusz Korczak. This allows Jim Shepard to detail the heroic efforts of Korczak to care for and love more children than is humanly possible. It also enables him to put Korczak's Declaration of Children's Rights before the reader's eyes.Telling the story through the eyes of an innocent gives the story a poignancy that tears at the reader's heart. Aron loves his family and friends, but sometimes his decisions cause their deaths and I wanted to pull him out of the novel and hug him and tell him it wasn't his fault. The book engages the reader from beginning to end as Nazi inhumanity attempts to destroy Jewish humanity.For further reading, after your heart heals, one of the best books I've read about the Warsaw Ghetto is Lucy Davidowicz's The War Against the Jews: 1933-1945.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT801AAFIMCQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874317#wasThisHelpful","RT801AAFIMCQS","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Having taught 8th grade for fifteen years I found his portrayal of Anthony and the issues that the book centers around to be realistic. When a member of his band gets suspended he gets mad.

Teens, especially 8th graders are teeming with displaced anger.He finally finds an outlet for his anger by writing a song with the ""F"" word in it.

The book's themes include peer pressure, community standards, expressing anger in a socially accepted way, and empathy.The author's handling of the issues is both tasteful and well-done. He captures the feeling that teens sometimes have that the next school dance or sleep over, or in this case playing in a concert is the most important thing in the world and if they don't get their way that world will end. They can be both willful and short-sighted and Kevin Emerson's story captures that angst.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3P5LZAXLZEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385391129#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3P5LZAXLZEB","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I very much enjoyed reading The Temple of Light. The novel has several interesting story strands that center on Niccolo, the rightful heir of the Duke of Milan. Since he is young and vulnerable, and those vying for power would think nothing of killing him, he is kept hidden by a secret society of Celtic priests who have infiltrated the Catholic Church. As the years pass, he bears witness to court intrigues and murders and the priests’ efforts to build a temple to bring man closer to God. He also becomes involved in alchemy and the secret rites of the druids.  Piazza adds spice to the novel by having Niccolo fall in love with Angelica. Their love is forbidden since he is noble and expected to rule while she is a commoner. He also befriends an assassin and his sister which gives even greater insights into the machinations of the aristocracy especially when the Inquisition is involved.  This complex novel gives a snapshot of life during the 15th century and displays Piazza’s knowledge of Italian history, so much so that at times I found myself lost among the myriad of names and the relationships between the characters. If the novel were better edited by taking out all those characters that are not absolutely essential to the story, I think it has best seller potential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8CRHP6Y1T0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504000692#wasThisHelpful","RG8CRHP6Y1T0I","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Martha Stewart demonstrated a super easy recipe on her show last weekend. She grated a wedge of Parmesan cheese, added a stick of softened butter and blended them together in a mixer. After her noodles were cooked to aldente consistency, she drained them and reserved a cup of the water.

"After I watched the movie with Anthony Hopkins, I had to read the book. I found The Rite to be thought provoking to say the least. It contains many credible accounts of possessions and exorcisms. The book provides an in depth and fascinating look at the why and how of exorcisms.Anyone interested in theology or the occult will find the book interesting. Many might even find their faith in the church strengthened by the book. After my own read, I find myself contemplating several questions.  If there are demons and they can truly can possess a human being, why is possession more frequent among Catholics than other religions? Why is demonic possession ( in Western industrialized countries) found almost exclusively among true believers of the Christian faith? Is a demon simply the embodiment of evil that forms an entity in a person's mind?Can the phenomenon described in the book be explained through science or psychology? Why does Rome seem the be the epicenter of possession?Reading The Rite brought back memories of a book I read in the 80s about the Church of Satan. Prior to writing this review, I read the reviews For Michelle RemembersMichelle remembers; the True Story of a Year-long Contest Between Innocence and Evil. Most of the reviewers think the account is a fraud, but I think it was one of the scariest books I've ever read. I bring the book up because it might be of interest to those of you who enjoyed this one. I loaned my first copy to a Lutheran minister who had a nervous breakdown not long afterward. He never returned the book and I haven't seen him since.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LSBPONZ0U6WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385522711#wasThisHelpful","R2LSBPONZ0U6WM","AKAZT5193KFR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKAZT5193KFR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It recounts a timeless struggle between father and son. Sam Keen, the father, is an overbearing parent who tells instead of shows. Gifford is the proverbial rebellious child, deeply hurt and angered by his father's abandonment through divorce and circumstances. Now as grown-ups, they try to reconcile by sharing their views and perceptions of the past. Writing this book together gave both a deeper understanding of the other and the reader also gains a deeper understanding of their own familial relationships.The book is both poignant and fascinating and the writing is superb.

"The Good: The design pattern is pretty and seasonal.  It's got a nice shine, and is a good size. The weight is pretty light, so it's easy to move around.The Bad: The sticker on the back is awful to pull off. I had to scrape away at it just so that it wouldn't show through the spaces on the top. The stubs are only on 3 of the 6 points - it's stable if you are very careful about placing an item directly on the center, but if you nudge it even a bit to the side the whole thing tips! And as it's about a half inch above the table, anything on top would certainly spill.

We evolved as a species that had to work hard for its food"" (p. 97).""Many people think they are more active than actual measurement reveals"" (p. 122).""...although we eat food, what we actually need are nutrients"" (p. 229).""Obesity isn't excess weight; it is excess adipose tissue"" (p. 244)""Just consider for a moment the  expectations you would have it an animal's liver or adrenal gland doubled in size.  That would have metabolic and health consequences.  Obesity is an increase in adipose tissue well beyond the functional range that was typically experienced in the past.  The secretions from adipose will likely be  out of balance with the other organ systems"" (p. 247).""We propose that modern obesity can be explained as evolutionary adaptive (or neutral) responses that in the modern environment result in maladaptive physiological responses. We further propose that many of the differences between men and women in the propensity to obesity and the associated health consequences are reflections of the different  adaptive pressures that have shaped male and female biology"" (p. 265-266).""We evolved as an active species; we are not sessile creatures.

"The idea of this heated wrap is much better than how this Serta Cuddler Electric Heated Wrap with Pockets actually works.  First, the photos show the wrap with pockets on the outside.

So, if you are wearing it with the pockets out, there's a very unattractive label on your shoulder.  Turn it the other way, with the pockets inside, and the feel of the soft fabric is affected by... the huge label!  It's hard to tell which way is which even by looking at the seams.Okay, back to the idea of the wrap.  Who doesn't want to be warm, right?  But the heating elements are concentrated in the BACK of the wrap, meaning that when you are sitting, the heating elements are pressed against your back.  Your back is HOT, while your front is... not. It is a weird feeling!  I wanted to pull the wrap more tightly around me so that my front could get some of the heat from the heating elements.

There is an initial greasy/oily feeling, but it goes away.I tried treating one hand and not the other to see whether there were visible effects simply from the active and inactive ingredients... no effects were obvious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNE7EC9HLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EUSL5U#wasThisHelpful","R1LNE7EC9HLV","AS6SH2JM2YY3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6SH2JM2YY3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book, The Professional Guide To Urban Wildlife Removal, is a useful and accurate guide to the DIY oriented person, as well as the person wanting to engage the services of a NWCO (nuisance wildlife control operator).  DIY?  Author David Vyse gives pretty thorough instructions on how to identify and locate the culprit, and then how to get remove the animal or get the animal to remove itself (and babies).  Finally, Vyse discusses the minor construction tips needed to prevent future damage.I like the contents of this book, but it is rather limited on the species covered (raccoons, skunks, squirrels, ""birds,"" bats, and mice).  As a 50 page book, it seems pricey.  However, have you looked at the prices for hiring a NWCO?By the way, hiring a professional is indicated if a bat is located in a room that a child or adult has or had been sleeping in, if there are significant waste deposits, if considerable ladder work is required, or if you think you might have left an animal inside your house after repairs. It's expensive, but you need to make sure the problem isn't worse because of your efforts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAQPJAY760X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986855200#wasThisHelpful","R1BAQPJAY760X4","AS6SH2JM2YY3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6SH2JM2YY3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've not been happy with the numerous travel razors I've tried over the years.  They are too loud, cut too poorly, hard to clean, or battery hogs.So far, I'm liking this Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve Compact Mens Shaver With Double Blades.The positives:  It's not as loud as some (less chance of waking up your roomie).  It feels good in your hand, and leaves you with a close shave (although not near as close as my Norelco SensoTouch 3D).  I don't shave in the shower, so I really don't use the ""wet/dry"" feature, although the O-ring and cinching mechanism sealing the battery compartment seems robust.The negatives: It's a narrow cutting field, so it takes longer to shave (it is a traveling razor, after all).  I didn't feel that the shave was particularly good over the angular parts of the face (edge of jaw, chin).  You have to keep working at these areas.  There is no trimmer, not a brush, as some travel razors have.I'll write more when I get a sense of how long the batteries (2-AA, not included) last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JHBFJXPLX41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009DT34W#wasThisHelpful","R3JHBFJXPLX41","AS6SH2JM2YY3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6SH2JM2YY3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: For this Star Wars-themed Crayola Light Up Tracing Pad, the platform itself works very well. After adding in the three required AA batteries, the light is very bright and even. The colored pencils and markers are only half size (a few inches), but good quality. There are two sets of activities - using the markers to color in the plastic sheet designs, and using the pencils to trace character images onto new sheets. There are a variety of designs - a couple of large backgrounds, an image of each major character, a few ships.Cons: Some of the images aren't set up well for tracing. They're either overly detailed or have huge black areas that take forever to fill in. It would be better to have simpler backgrounds that could be more easily worked behind the many great character images. Also, some of the images seem a little repetitive - how many clone/dark side helmets in different sizes do we need?Including a pencil sharpener would have been a nice touch. Also, the battery case screws are unnecessarily tiny, so have a small screwdriver on hand!Bottom Line: It's a great, fun toy that could use a little tweaking. Use the platform, and supplement the tracing with other images.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6YH8XR7TTY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRUVL2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3O6YH8XR7TTY1","AS6SH2JM2YY3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6SH2JM2YY3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a preliminary review, as I need to take this camera (Samsung Electronics EC-DV180FBPWUS Dual View Wireless Smart Camera) through its paces under a variety of conditions.  Initially, I was irritated at once.  The camera did not come with a memory card!  What?  So I had to wait for a few days to order one (I chose a Samsung 32GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDHC ).  Installation of the card, and initial set up of the camera was intuitive and easy.Selfies are the talk of the town, and digital cameras have to compete against smart phones.  So this camera has two LCDs, ""a 2.7-inch screen in the back and a 1.5-inch screen on the front.""  And guess what?

"I don't want this review to seem overly complicated.  The odors from ""number 2"" - dropping a loaf - mostly come from volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) like hydrogen sulfide.  The odors don't emerge from the water; rather, they are released during the deposit (do I need to make myself more clear?).  Therefore, odors are not ""neutralized"" by any kind of contact with this product, Poo-Pourri, on the surface of the water.I suspect the essential oils overpower the other odors.  That is, the VSC are present, but either your olfactory receptors are being captured with the airborne molecules from the essential oils, or your brain is paying more attention to the essential oils than the VSC.  I don't think this is olfactory fatigue, it is a different process.  It's like using Vick's Vapour Rub to keep from smelling decaying flesh (did you ever watch a SCI show?).  The odor is still there, but it is being masked.The loaf still smells, but you have a hard time smelling it.  This probably means that people with a sensitive nose will smell the VSC.So what does this mean for my review?  First, I don't believe the action of the Poo-Pourri is as claimed.  Thus, the manufacturer is not telling the consumer how it really works.  Ding.Next, the instructions say to spritz it in the toilet 3-5 times, and then the ""essential oils create a film on the surface of the water."" This does make a film, but the purpose of the film is that the product spreads over the the water surface, increasing volatilization, so the molecules spread rapidly in the bowl and beyond. This volatilization is effective, and you probably only need ONE spritz, two at the most.  So you are wasting product if you follow the printed directions. Ding.Lastly, the bottle top is not as secure as I would expect.  Can you picture even a little of these essential oils leaking in a suitcase?  I could smell the leakage when I took the bottle out of the package. Ding.So the product works as a masking agent, you can stretch out the life of a bottle by using less, but the bottle will leak.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29XA2FXAT4MG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01486Z7WC#wasThisHelpful","R29XA2FXAT4MG8","AS6SH2JM2YY3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6SH2JM2YY3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a Thule backpack (Thule EnRoute Escort Daypack for 17-Inch MacBook Pro and 10-Inch Tablets - Gray (TEED-117)) that has been a part of my profile for the past 2 years.  I love the quality and the performance.  It's a bit large when I don't have a lot to carry, however, especially if I am just taking my computer down to Starbucks.  So I was excited to try out this model.First, quality.  The material, the sewing, and the straps all seem to be first rate.  No dings here at all.Now performance.  One side has a bottle holder, and the other side has a padded pocket for either glasses or a phone.  These are okay.  But there are three things that I really have problems with.  First, there needs to be a bit more padding at the bottom of the pack.  I want enough padding in the bottom so that it it is dropped from chest height (it's a pack, right?), the edge of my computer is safe.  I'll put my own padding in the bottom of the computer pocket because I don't trust the padding that this pack comes with.  Second, I have always wanted a computer backpack with a watertight cover.  The photo provided with this product looked like the top flap folded over, a bit like a dry bag.  But it is possible for the top flap to close and the sides to be open, allowing water to enter.  With my computer inside, that's a no-no.  And finally, if you are thin, the straps aren't that secure on your shoulders.  A chest strap would have helped here, as would have more ergonomically designed shoulder straps.Since I planned to use this when cycling to my office or Starbucks, I liked both the orange color and the loop for attaching a blinky light.  I also liked the handle on top when carrying it like a briefcase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SWDNRLQKI6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KBD3I#wasThisHelpful","R1SWDNRLQKI6K","AS6SH2JM2YY3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6SH2JM2YY3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sir Adrian Boult is known to most people as the conductor of the soundtrack to David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" even though he in fact didn't conduct a single note of the soundtrack (the whole thing was actually conducted by composer Maurice Jarre. Boult's name appeared in the film credits only in order to secure a recording grant from the British government, while at the same time, Jarre's name was featured prominently as conductor on the soundtrack recording LP. Apparently, no one noticed the discrepancy!).Boult was primarily a conductor of classical music, and he had an incredibly wide repertoire, a fact which may surprise those who consider him a British music specialist. That's probably due to the fact that Boult's non-British recordings never had wide release outside of the UK. Save for his cycle of Brahms symphonies and a couple of LPs-worth of Wagner bleeding chunks, his presence on US record shelves was confined primarily to the music of RVW, Elgar, Holst and other Brits.So it's very nice that EMI (now Warner) has seen fit to release an entire 11-CD box of his German repertoire (the box cover proclaims ""from Bach to Wagner,"" even though Wolf's short ""Italian Serenade"" is included as well). In general, the recordings and performance come off as sober, middle-of-the-road affairs, with a fairly high standard of orchestral execution in variable recorded sound. Winds tend to be very forward, which makes for interesting listening in the Brahms Symphonies, for example.There is a lot of Wagner in this set. A LOT. And although most of it is well-played, there's nothing interpretively special about it that will make one forsake their Furtwängler and Karajan recordings (also on EMI). Boult provides interesting, low-key endings to both the Parsifal and Tristan Act I preludes, and the Good Friday Music comes off very nicely here. Recorded sound is a mixed bag, though.I am a fan of Boult's way with the Bach Brandenburgs, which are a big-band affair, though informed with what was the then-emerging HIP movement ideals. The recordings feature the late-lamented David Munrow on recorder in both the 4th and 2nd concertos, a feat in the 2nd that is aided by some subtle spotlighting in the mix.Boult's Mozart and Beethoven is also big band, which is alright with me. He draws a fine singing quality from the orchestra in these recordings which are damned for today's audiences by their extreme competence and excellent balances. Such things are - sadly - no longer admired in our thrill-a-second entertainment environment. His Schubert 9th gains traction as it moves along and is entirely satisfying.Sir Adrian was the Ever-ready Bunny of classical music. Forced into mandatory retirement from his post at the BBC in 1950 at age 61, he spent the final 28 years of his long life recording and performing just about everywhere else, primarily with the LPO - and occasional even with the BBC! - with whom he made the majority of his EMI recordings. Those recordings do him proud, and it's very nice to have access to his German rep recordings through this box set.Recommended. Grab it while it's available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157TCJ04SK4JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084HGZKA#wasThisHelpful","R157TCJ04SK4JF","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Needless to say, it was a tremendous performance, especially for a high-school student who was making his first forays into the world of orchestral concerts. Little did I know that that performance would rather spoil me for the rest of my life when it came to Verdi's magnificent Requiem, but it pretty well did.In the ensuing years, I heard Maestro Maazel again conduct the Requiem at the Blossom Music Center with a less-stellar cast of soloists, while also participating in performances as a chorus tenor in venues like St Bartholomew's Church in NYC (with organ!) to a performance at Carnegie Hall that featured close to 600 musicians in the orchestra and chorus. I even sang in a concert at Carnegie Hall that featured Verdi's ""Libera me"" movement from the mass he and a dozen other Italian composers wrote to honor the death of Rossini. So I'd say that I have a fairly intimate knowledge of the piece from the inside and the outside.Which brings us to this new Sony recording of the piece under the direction of Maestro Maazel. The good news is that his wonderfully distinctive interpretation is on full display here, aided by great playing by the orchestra, an excellent chorus and with recorded sound that is pretty darn good for a live recording. Where it fails to compete is in the vocal soloists, all of whom sound rather young and under-developed to take on a piece like the Requiem. Yes, the singing is competent and occasionally expressive, but this quartet simply can't compete with the typically star-driven vocal quartets that grace most recordings of the Verdi Requiem. I say that as one who has been involved in performances in the NYC area where a group of up-and-coming but unknown solo singers have sung their parts with an artistry that's only a few rungs below the very, very best. So, while I was hoping that this might have been one of those occasions, it isn't, and more's the pity.With all of that said, it is still good to have Maazel's Verdi Requiem finally inscribed for posterity on commercial CDs. The Verdi was something of a signature piece for Maazel, and I've always been baffled that none of the record labels for whom Maazel recorded extensively over his lengthy career - DG, Decca, Philips, EMI, Sony, Telarc et al - ever elected to record the piece with him in his prime, and to provide him with a set of world-class soloists and a renowned orchestra and chorus for the occasion. But for whatever reason, it never happened, and we should be grateful to Sony for setting things right to a large extent, even considering the caveats voiced above.For those who know the Maazel way with these large and sometimes sprawling scores, you'll be pleased to know that he is much less indulgent in terms of stretching ritardandi etc than he could be on occasion. He is possibly the only conductor I know who actually observes Verdi's marking of ""stentando poco a poco"" (holding back - note by note, little by little) in the ""Dies irae"" sequence, though even here the effect is less pronounced than I remember it from the performances he conducted in Cleveland. Maazel was also a wonderful accompanist for solo artists, and he does a fine job here, both in supporting his solo singers and in leading them through a few passages that are usually taken more broadly by singers with greater technical resources. The orchestra also sings under Maazel's leadership, and I must say that it is refreshing to hear a true *legato"" coming from all of the performers throughout the recording. Balances are spot on, and the chorus is tastefully given a little more presence in the soundstage than is often the case.I would have given this recording 5 stars had the soloists been closer to the major league types who have graced recordings of the Verdi Requiem in the past. At 4 stars, this is still a highly recommendable version, and a fitting tribute to a great musician who left us all too early in 2014.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXDY611PUK5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6XU1J0#wasThisHelpful","R3NXDY611PUK5X","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I owned the initial CD release of this set. As others have noted, that set included copious program notes that really help to give one an insight into the music. I gave that set away to a friend who's a bigger fan of Stravinsky than am I. I acquired this 22-CD set from a third-party seller for all of $20.99 plus shipping and a little tax. It's worth it to once again own these recordings (it's a shame that Sony didn't see its way clear to include the booklets on a CD-R, or to make pdf's of the booklets available online). Then again, there's plenty of music out there that's just as challenging as is Stravinsky's that can be enjoyed on the purely aural level without any need of a written apologia/explanation.I am not the world's greatest Stravinsky fan. I find probably half of his music enjoyable. The rest seems incredibly light weight and meandering to me. Outside of his early ballets - Firebird, Petrushka and The Rite - it tends to go downhill for me. Yes, I like Apollo and Orpheus well enough, and the melodramas come off well here (mainly due to the contributions of tenor George Shirley), but I have never warmed to The Soldier's Tale or the Symphonies, for example. I can't stand the Symphony of Psalms, but that's probably because I've had to perform the vocally un-ingratiating chorus tenor part on more than a few occasions. Ugh!As an interpreter of his own music, Stravinsky is - IMHO - just OK. There are plenty of musicians who do it better, at least if you consider his oeuvre on a piece-by-piece basis. I like his Firebird and Petrushka here, the Rite, not so much, though it actually sounds better in this issue than it does in any number of other Sony CD issues of this same recording that are currently available.So, worth having, especially at the price. I see that Sony is planning an über-complete Stravinsky set for October, 2015. That set will include all of his mono recordings as well and looks to run to 57 CDs in length. However, it also looks to have a healthy price tag attached to it (currently pre-ordering @ $219). This present budget issue is a good deal, considering everything.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FANBDNDM512C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PTYUQG#wasThisHelpful","R1FANBDNDM512C","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warner Music having acquired the EMI catalog has opted to issue these EMI recordings on their French Erato label, which makes perfect sense.I've performed quite a few of Poulenc's choral works over the years, including Sécheresses and Figure humaine (though I've never had the opportunity to perform his Gloria). I became a Poulenc fan back in my college days, and I remain a fan, even though I never really explored his music much outside of his vocal works. This set provided the opportunity to do just that, and at only $35, it was an easy choice to jump on the bargain.After listening to a number of the discs, I'm more convinced than ever that Poulenc's real forte was in the vocal realm. His solo piano works, for instance, are but confections compared to his vocal works, which plumb the depths of emotion and expression. His chamber music while enjoyable isn't the equal of his vocal utterances either. That said, EMI/Erato could have made better choices when it came to works like the Mass in G, which receives a weak performance by a men and boys choir.I'll take the occasion of this review to recommend that you become familiar with his early work Sécherreses, which combines Poulenc's original voice in a Stravinskyesque work for chorus and orchestra. It's pretty unusual and has received only three commercial recordings - the here-included 1984 EMI-sourced recording led by George Prêtre; a 2007 recording on the Swedish Nosag label conducted by Sonny Jansson; and the very first recording which was recorded at a gala anniversary concert of Les Six given on November 4, 1953, by the Societé du Concerts at the Théâtre du Champs-Élysées, hosted by Jean Cocteau.The only complaint I have is that there are no texts or translations enclosed. Disappointing when texts and translations were included in many of the EMI issues. Why not scan those booklets and include the texts on a CD-R?Recommended - as a collection filler, as a great intro to Poulenc, as a comprehensive edition and for the performances and recordings, which are for the most part top notch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIT3E65XGA4GN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091JQH76#wasThisHelpful","RIT3E65XGA4GN","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 70-CD set presumably concludes DG's issue of what they consider to be Herbert von Karajan's recorded legacy on the yellow label. Every CD in the first three sets in this series was remastered using DG's Original Image Bit Processing (OIBP) techniques, and to great effect. One can't be so sure that's true for this set. Falstaff - which features the cover art from the initial Philips LP/CD release - utilizes the DG CD label look, as do all of the other DG-released recordings.The CD labels for all of the DG-labeled discs indicate they were mastered using the OIBP process. The Decca issues feature a Decca FFSS LP label look, but there's no indication anywhere in the set to lead one to believe they have been remastered, though one might assume as much based on the practice followed for all of the other CDs in this 4-set series.Let me start by addressing the supposed ""completeness"" of this set, and of this series. It is something of a bonus that DG have seen fit to include Karajan's opera recordings that he made on Decca, as they include a few of his finest efforts in ""Boris Godunov,"" ""La boheme"" and ""Madama Butterfly."" His ""Nozze di Figaro"" is a top-flight mix of an interesting use of expressive parlando in much of the recitatives, great acting and some fabulous singing in the showcase arias and ensembles, coupled with a very sensitive orchestral accompaniment - and a studio recording, NOT a live performance as advertised elsewhere. His early Decca opera recordings of Aida, Fledermaus (with the Gala Sequence), Otello (with the Act 3 ballet music) and Tosca are very welcome here, and add substantially to this set had it been limited to only operas released on DG.But here's the rub with this box and this series:1. It's nice that DG included Karajan's Decca opera recordings...so why didn't they also include his 9-CDs worth of Decca orchestral recordings that were made with the Vienna Philharmonic in the 1960s? Seems to me that those very-fine-on-average recordings could have been included in the earlier sets, especially the recording of music from Giselle, which was basically a career one-off for Karajan. And what's with the cover art they used for the Decca recording of Tosca? This set was originally released stateside in RCA's Soria Series with much nicer artwork. Perhaps the cover portrait of Price that adorns the included CD set reflects the cover art Decca used when the rights to the recording reverted entirely to Decca. I don't know that, just making an educated guess.2. There are a number of live opera recordings that were released by DG on CD that are not included. I'm thinking of the Fidelio, Die frau ohne Schatten, Tannhauser, Murder in the Cathedral and Coronation of Poppea that were released on DG CDs in the late 1990s. Was there a licensing problem including them in this set? All of those performances were done at the Vienna Staatsoper, and I wonder if - perhaps - the licensing fee was just too high to include those sets in a box being sold at a super budget price.3. What about Karajan's very earliest recordings that were made just prior to and during WWII? These recordings have been released a couple of times on DG CDs. Why they weren't included in this series is a mystery.4. As nice as it is to have the excellent live performance of Haydn's ""Creation"" included - which gives us Fritz Wunderlich's full assumption of the tenor role, an assumption that was cut short by his untimely death during the recording of DG's studio version - what does it have to do with opera? I'm glad it's included, but there's no reason to have included it outside of someone being nice at DG, and not forcing us to buy this recording in its stand-alone CD issue.5. The lack of libretti for the operas is really unforgivable, as almost all of these recordings featured libretti in their earlier LP and CD issues. DG could have easily fit all of the libretti onto a single CD-R and included it in the box, a solution that worked just fine for EMI when they issued their Complete Karajan sets back in 2008. Truth be told, the opera box has even LESS info available than did the orchestral boxes in this series, as the LP-covers used in the orchestral works at least duplicated the liner notes that appeared on the back of the LP jackets (readable if you possess a good magnifying glass).So, there are issues here, even if they pale when set against the musical performances set down on these CDs and revealed through some accomplished remastering.I'd now like to offer a few reviews of specific recordings to give potential buyers a feeling for 1. the strength of the performances, and 2. the remastered sound on the CDs (those wishing more in depth reviews of the individual operas can avail themselves of reviews written elsewhere on Amazon):Bizet: the included recording of ""Carmen"" was Karajan's second studio recording of the opera, third if you include his movie version, and it's the weakest of the three. Karajan's preference for light voices at this stage of his career is a negative, especially in this opera. What the singers in this DG production can't deliver in sheer vocal weight and glamour they attempt to deliver through vocal acting that wears thin on repeat hearings. It's also a bit disconcerting to have the spoken dialogue voiced by actors, rather than the singers themselves. Not a bad idea in theory, but in practice, the differences between the sung and spoken are glaring - one is keenly aware that the voices just don't match up. Recorded sound is good, better than I remember from the initial CD release. There are better Carmens available, but no one buying this set is buying it based on the strength of the included Carmen.Lehar: Karajan's recording of ""Die lustige Witwe"" is quite enjoyable, a reminder that he was usually very successful when he ventured into the lighter fare. While many prefer Schwarzkopf's Hanna to that of Harwood, I'm not in that crowd (the best onstage Hanna I ever had the pleasure of hearing was sung by Mary Costa). Karajan utilizes a cast that looks odd on paper but works in practice. I have slight grievances with Kollo and Hollweg in the tenor leads, but they still do quite well. The orchestral playing is gorgeous and the interpretation - while not dripping with nostalgia - is excellent. The second CD in the set is filled out with a selection of Suppé overtures. Remastered sound is excellent.Leoncavallo/Mascagni: The La Scala-based ""Cav-Pag"" is a classic, with really great performances from the lead singers. I used to find the Cav a bit on the low energy side, but now I hear it as a beautiful rendition of music that too often takes on the countrified persona of the chorus of villagers. I owned these recordings in their LP and early CD versions, and the sound on this OIBP version is really good - it enhances what were already recommended performances.Mozart: The above-mentioned ""Le nozze di Figaro"" comes up very well in whatever mastering has been included in this box. Getting reacquainted with this recording after not hearing it in probably 20+ years was a satisfying experience. I like José van Dam's Figaro more this time around while I am less enamored of Frederica von Stade's Cherubino and Ileana Cotrubas' Susanna, while Anna Tomowa-Sintow's Countess isn't the equal of other singers in this role. Still, less enamored doesn't equal displeasure - the cast overall is excellent.Don Giovanni is an opera that I have been trying to find enjoyable for 45 years...and it isn't happening. I've performed in it a couple of times and have heard just about every recording, and I still run screaming from the encounter. So, I'm probably not the best person to comment on the included recording, but I will. Orchestra and interpretation are good as is the cast, save for the insufferable Kathleen Battle's mouse-sized voice singing Zerlina. Inexpressive and monochromatic at best, her voice and her overly precious singing doesn't fare well set against the remainder of the cast. Ramey is a good Don if not in the Siepi class, while Baltsa and Tomowa-Sintow are enjoyable if not competitive with legendary singers who have taken these roles. Sound is clear and colorful. If Don G is your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy this.Mussorgsky: Karajan was a champion of the Rimsky-Korsakov version of Boris Godunov, and that's the version presented in the fabulous Decca recording included in this set. Personally, I'm also a Rimsky man when it comes to Boris. I know all the arguments against it and I really don't care - no other version engages and moves me as does Rimsky's. The performance itself is incredibly well performed - strong, direct and of a massive scale. Ghiaurov's Boris is a tour-de-force, and he is in particularly excellent voice here. The entire cast is first rate, strong and idiomatic. The choral sound produced by the combined Sofia and Vienna Staatsoper choirs is overwhelming, while the Vienna Phil plays magnificently, with outstanding work from the brass and woodwinds. Karajan has the full measure of this piece and delivers what I consider to be a near-definitive all-around version. The recorded sound is of demonstration quality, and the remaster has removed any hint of hiss from the analog masters. This recording is one of the highlights of this set. Indeed, it's a highlight of Karajan's entire recorded operatic oeuvre. Highly recommended.Puccini: The 1972 Decca ""La bohéme"" was a classic upon its release and remains so to this day. Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti are both in tip-top form, pouring out streams of golden Italianate tone that is completely satisfying on its own. Yet that tone is coupled to interpretations that are moving and individual. The stars - both earthly and heavenly - were aligned when this gem was set down. The overall cast is excellent, though one might quibble with Harwood's Musetta. The orchestra is tremendous (even considering the rather blatant clam in the trumpets in the penultimate bars of Act 2), while Karajan fully captures the emotional gamut that this opera runs in its relatively short time frame. The recorded sound captured at the Jesus Christus Kirche in Berlin is of demonstration quality. Recommended on every level imaginable.Karajan followed up his Bohéme recording with Madame Butterfly, set down in 1974 with Freni and Pavarotti again appearing in the lead roles. Luxury casting extends to the use of the Vienna Philharmonic and the inclusion of Christa Ludwig's Suzuki, which is finely drawn and wonderfully sung. I do feel that Pavarotti sometimes verges on the edge of lapsing into a croon, but he never really steps over the line. His Pinkerton isn't the usually boisterous, obnoxious American, but is perhaps a more innocent take on the character. At least it's a multifaceted performance, even if one never finds themselves in real sympathy with the character. Mirella Freni is the sweetest Butterfly on disc, and I must say that I prefer this recording to her later DG remake with Sinopoli: what she gains in drama under Sinopoli she loses in the little-girl innocence she displayed under Karajan. I count this Decca recording as my desert island version of the opera. I would note that after years of gouging consumers by spreading this recording over 3 full-priced CDs, DG/Decca have somehow found a way to fit the thing on 2 CDs for inclusion in this multi-CD set. Recorded sound is once again of demonstration quality.Karajan's DG ""Tosca"" is an analogue recording from 1979. The sound is quite phenomenal, though the performance isn't the norm, featuring two romantic protagonists in José Carerras and Katia Ricciarelli who sing beautifully but whose voices are a bit on the light side. I have a hard time imagining this particular Cavaradossi being any kind of a revolutionary, just as I have a difficult time believing that this Tosca had it in her to commit murder, even as an act of total spontaneity. I will say that I enjoyed Ruggerro Raimondi's Scarpia - chalk it up to old age, as I rather disliked his performance when I first heard it on LPs.The digital recording of ""Turandot"" dates from 1981, and while it features a good interpretation and great playing and singing from the Vienna Phil and the Stattsopernchor, it is generally let down by the leads, none of whom can match the performances available elsewhere. Katia Ricciarelli's assumption of the title role was widely and justly criticized when the recording was released, and it hasn't been helped in this new issue. Sad, because this recording was set down only two years after the above-mentioned Tosca, and while the voice is still pretty to listen to in the middle range, the high range is now a mess. It's almost like she sings one way in the middle voice and then allows her larynx to ride high in her throat to reach the high notes. Nilsson she's not. Domingo's Calaf also suffers when compared to the great exponents of this role. His voice is under tremendous pressure most of the time, especially in the high range in which he sounds very uncomfortable, bulling his way through passages that others sing with power and finesse. No one will hold it against you when you find yourself pulling down recordings by Merli, Corelli, Pavarotti or Bjoerling as a corrective to the Domingo Calaf. Hendricks' Liu is too light by half, and that greatly limits her ability to express this role the way it is usually sung, where the artist singing Liu often walks away with the vocal honors for the evening (i.e.: a finely spun high pianissimo delivered by a voice of some vocal heft is always going to be more impressive than the same pianissimo effect delivered by a smallish voice, if for no other reason that there's more dynamic variation between the singer's basic vocal sound and the pianissimo in the larger voice). This is definitely an example of a recording where the ""orchestra as protagonist"" approach to opera has diminishing returns. Sound is very good, if ultimately lacking the clarity and color of the Mehta version on Decca.Verdi: Karajan's second studio recording of Falstaff was recorded by DG, but released on the Philips label at the time so as not to compete with Giulini's DG recording that was released at the same time. A few decades later (after the Philips label ceased to exist), the recording reverted to and was released on DG at full price, with later midline issues on Decca. For this issue, DG has utilized the original Philips art work and branding for the CD sleeve while using the DG look for the CDs themselves. Overall, the performance is excellent, with real star turns by veterans Giuseppe Taddei and Rolando Panerai in the key male roles, with Christa Ludwig, Raina Kabaivanska and Trudeliese Schmidt as Quickly, Alice & Meg, respectively. While all of these veterans' voices had seen better years by the time the recording was set down, the experience and entertainment value they bring is palpable. The young lovers are taken by Francisco Araiza and Janet Perry, with mixed results. Araiza engages in quite a bit of off-the-voice crooning that's uncharacteristic of his normal vocal approach, while Ms Perry's extremely small voice has nowhere to go in either direction to make a dynamic point. No, one needs to listen to a singer with a wealthier voice - like Anna Moffo in Karajan's first recording - to get the full effect of what a role like Nannetta offers the singer. The orchestra and Karajan's interpretation are top drawer - powerful when needed, funny and intimate when required. It's a real mystery why this opera - Verdi's ultimate - isn't more well-known and -loved among the general public.""Il trovatore"" is the famous live recording from Salzburg in 1962. Most vocal aficionados place this performance near the top of the heap, despite the just-OK mono sound. To my ears, the performance has a rough first act, with Zaccaria nearly coming apart in Ferrando's opening aria. Price starts off a bit off-center, but gains her footing by the Act 1 trio. Corelli gains strength through the performance as well. Bastianini struggles through ""il balen,"" but also improves as the show moves along. I have always felt that Simionata had an off night as Azucena. The Chorus of the Vienna Staatsoper and the Vienna Phil give us an Austrian version of Verdi, which is to say it's not the most idiomatic Verdi you'll ever hear. Karajan plays things rather straight, though there are a lot of coordination problems between the stage and the pit. Acts 3 & 4 fare best overall. Nice to have this included, but not a first, second or even third choice in my books.Wagner: Karajan's ""Ring"" has been my go-to version for decades. While it doesn't feature an unassailable cast (which Ring does?), it has enough great singing in it to satisfy most vocal aficionados while the interpretation and orchestral execution are the thing of legend. This is a Ring that surprises in both its nuance and - on occasion - bravura. The sound is quite good - better than it ever was on LP or the initial CD release - if not in the Decca class. Comparing the Act I ""Die Walkure"" in this set to the previously issued DG Originals version revealed no discernible difference in the sound, at least to my ears. Having recently purchased the fabled Solti Ring on BluRay audio disc, I would hope that Universal gives the same treatment to Karajan's Ring in the near future.All things considered, this is a nice conclusion to the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15EV42Z292AAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ULE2W42#wasThisHelpful","R15EV42Z292AAK","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Either my ears are shot or the majority of the amazon reviewers of this recording are hearing things I'm not, or maybe things they're imagining they're hearing.As others have noted, the recorded sound on this disc is mediocre, at best, with no sense of depth and an overall flat sound to the proceedings. Considering this is the Vienna Philharmonic one would hope for something much better.But the real problem with the recording is Boulez's way with the music, which lumps into long stretches of ennui punctuated by the occasional highlighting of interesting detail. The third movement suffers the worst, starting off with a way-too-exacting reading of the opening rhythm in the strings. Compare to Karajan (in any of his recordings) who treats the opening bars with great nuance and subtlety, allowing space for the rhythm to grow and grow until it is being hammered out in the orchestra leading into the first mini-climax of the movement. It's the difference between imagination and the perfunctory delineation of notes and rhythms.As with many Boulez recordings on DG, the sound is shallow and unattractive, and one wonders who is making the decision to present such sound to the consumer.I happen to love Boulez in certain late-Romantic works: Gurre-lieder, Debussy's Pelleas, and the orchestral music of Ravel & Debussy. I know he has it in him to present an echt-Romantic view of music when he so desires. Sadly, that desire is no where to be found on this release.Of course, others are tripping over themselves singing this recording's praises. Go figure.Boulez is a great musician and conductor. The Vienna Phil has this music in their blood. DG has made some great sounding recordings over the decades. But believing that the magical brew is alive and well on this release is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes.Look elsewhere for Brucknerian greatness (try Vienna/Karajan on DG or Berlin/Maazel on EMI/Warner).","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RVXI7SUCB4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004TL2N#wasThisHelpful","R1RVXI7SUCB4Q","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD of Schubert and Schumann lieder (recorded in 1965 & 67, respectively) has become something of a classic among classical music fans, whether they are vocal aficionados or not, and for good reason. It's an excellent program that includes many of the best-known songs by both composers, not to mention a near-definitive recording of Schubert's ""The Shepherd on the Rock.""The program starts off with ""The Shepherd,"" with Ameling joined by Jörg Demus on the Hammerflügel, with Hans Deinzer on clarinet. Ameling's deceptively easy vocalism sails through the piece, capturing each mood with nuance and subtlety. Her diction is excellent throughout and not overdone. Other Schubert favorites included are ""Gretchen am Spinnrad,"" ""Seligkeit,"" Im Frühling"" and ""Der Musensohn."" 19 of the CD's 28 tracks are dedicated to Schumann and include ""Widmung,"" Der Nussbaum"" and ""Der Sandmann.""The CD mastering from 1989 still holds up quite well, with a minimum of hiss and compression from the analog source material. It should be noted that the various tracks are sourced from different recording venues, with varying acoustics and different pianos. It's not bothersome, but it is noticeable.German texts and English translations are supplied, though not in a side-by-side layout. Program notes in German, English, French & Italian.Highly recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3RKP9XUL1O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001TWU#wasThisHelpful","R1F3RKP9XUL1O3","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I like Bernstein in Mahler and Beethoven, I really dislike his way with Sibelius.That's an opinion that I formed early on in my journey with classical music, back in the days of the LP, in fact. Now that I think about it, I probably have not heard these recordings since they made their first appearance on CD. But being one who is always open to reevaluating my position on music and/or musicians, this newly remastered version of Bernstein's Sibelius cycle provided an opportunity to look anew at one of my favorite composers seen through the eyes of one of my favorite conductors.Alas, I'm left with my existing feelings well intact - Bernstein just doesn't ""get it"" when it comes to the Sibelian ethos. His Sibelius is hyperactive, goosed and boosted beyond the point of excitement into the realm of the ridiculous. Such an approach - which, truth be told, is fairly one-dimensional - tends to make the music sound much less interesting and less deep than it actually is. Sure, there are those always interesting ""Lenny"" moments where the conductor elevates a secondary or tertiary voice to ""I hadn't noticed that before"" prominence, but doing so doesn't add anything to one's appreciation or understanding of the music, especially when a byproduct is that the true leading voice gets buried. Elevating Sibelius' ostinato motor rhythms to prominence makes as much sense as would elevating an Alberti bass to prominence in a classical sonata.The First and Second Symphonies suffer the most from this approach, with both pieces coming off as strangely inconsequential compositions (his DG remakes are far, far superior). The Third rather hangs fire most of the time, with the closing bars ending in a most-perfunctory manner. The Fourth is so far off course from the norm that one might be taken in by the prospect, but the almost-always forte dynamic approach causes the various choirs of the orchestra to play at a heightened dynamic level for their parts to cut through the din, and this results in a tonal quality that misses the composer's intent. There is no mystery here, no sense of anything lying beneath the notes themselves.The Fifth fares a little better (as does Pohoja's Daughter), but it is let down by a bland final movement, with the final disconnected chords despatched in the tritest of manners. The Sixth is an uncommitted affair that comes off as a read through, rather than a performance, with a finale that is a not-always-successful scramble for notes and ensemble at a speed that's too fast by half. The Seventh starts out promisingly enough, but Bernstein then elects to goose up the tempi and the dynamics to the extent that this 4-movement-symphony-in-1-movement loses all sense of being a unique direction for the composer. Somehow, Bernstein makes it sound...common.The performance of the Violin Concerto is another overheated, square, monochromatic and ultimately off-putting affair. I invite you to compare this version to the Ferras/Karajan version on DG to hear what is missing in Bernstein's approach. It's night and day. We get something of a bonus in the way of Bruch #1 being coupled on this CD (conducted by Thomas Schippers) - not the greatest performance, but a superior performance to its Sibelius disc mate.The final CD in the set is a ""Great Performances"" disc of Grieg Peer Gynt Suites 1 & 2 and Sibelius' Finlandia, The Swan of Tuonela and Valse triste. Again, it's hard to feel that Bernstein has any real affinity for these pieces. He just doesn't trust them to work on their own merits and seems to feel compelled to pick and pull them into something that he can relate to. Compare his Grieg to Beecham or Karajan and you'll see what I mean.For the sake of completeness, I'd mention that the set also includes Luonnotar (coupled with the 1st Symphony), featuring soprano Phyllis Curtin. Having had master classes with Ms Curtin back in 1974-75, I don't want to be too harsh with her, but her performance misses the other-wordly quality evoked by other sopranos like Karita Mattila and Soile Isokoski, whose voices have an easier top range and who can at least disguise the effort necessary to sing this piece.I can't express how disappointed I was with this set, due entirely to Bernstein's interpretation (the re-done sound is excellent, while the playing of the NYPO is top notch, save for a few blemishes here and there). Compared to Sibelius masters like Herbert von Karajan and Lorin Maazel (try his Pittsburgh set, also on Sony at about HALF the price of this one) who find layer after layer of interest and nuance in this music, Bernstein hardly qualifies as the Sibelian country cousin. Sibelius' music operates on many levels, and it's very odd that a musician of Bernstein's stature seems to be blind and deaf to most of those levels. This is Sibelius taken not on the composer's terms, but on those of the conductor.As there are many great Sibelius options out there these days at every conceivable price point, I find myself unable to recommend this version on any level. Indeed, I would even recommend Sir Colin Davis' just-reissued RCA cycle above this - it features sound and interpretations that are superior to the set under review - even though I found myself calling that set uncompetitive in an amazon review I penned just a few months ago.I wish I could be more enthusiastic, but I can't.Two and a half stars - it's okay...barely.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E7RG3TFKKUUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOFIUDK#wasThisHelpful","R2E7RG3TFKKUUT","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The nice thing about this power strip is that of the 12 standard AC outlets available, 6 run along the sides of the unit (as one can see in the product image), allowing enough space between each outlet to plug in the kind of oversized power cord head that seems to be a feature of much AV equipment these days. On most strips, you have only the option of plugging such a head into the end outlet, and even then it often covers part of the outlet above it, making that outlet unusable.

"I went for the ""book"" version of this BluRay, even though it ran a few dollars more than the standard BD packaging. Very nice!This movie isn't as well known as other Wayne oaters like Rio Bravo or El Dorado, and it doesn't possess the magic of those films either. In fact, it can seem a bit meandering when compared to other top-drawer Wayne fare. But no one bats a thousand and being a B-level success as opposed to being an A level success is often a case of splitting hairs in the eye of the beholder.I can still recommend this movie, especially if it's not familiar to you.

"If you have room for but a single lieder recording in your collection, this is the disc to own, for it captures the unique and magnificent voice of tenor Fritz Wunderlich to perfection.Now, granted, the piano playing isn't the most-imaginative, and Wunderlich himself interpretively surpassed this studio effort of Dichterliebe in his live performance at Edinburgh in 1966 (captured on a MYTO CD), but all things considered, one couldn't hope for a more-sensitive approach to this repertoire, performed by one of the most-gorgeous voices to have ever been recorded, any time, anywhere.Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FPHR7U85HXNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GXG#wasThisHelpful","R3FPHR7U85HXNB","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"No need to review the story of this well-known classic -I'll limit my comments to the BD presentation.First off, I had trouble booting this BD in two of my BD players. Both produced a black screen after I hit the play button. I did a thorough cleaning of the disc with a lens wipe, and that did something because the BD then played flawlessly. So, I saved myself a return/exchange that I didn't need to make.The movie comes up well in its BD guise, with sound and visual acceptable if not a huge improvement from the DVD version.

"My son got me this set as a Fathers Day gift. A good choice as it's not something I would buy for myself!I'm a musician but not an organist. My brother, however, was an organ major and often featured ""God with us"" from The Nativity as one of his concert showpieces, and being a church singer for many years, I heard quite a bit of Messiaen.That said, I was never fortunate enough to hear Messiaen on an instrument that is the magnitude of that at Notre Dame! The instrument is tremendous - colorful, powerful and clean. Latry has both the technique and the imagination required to show this music in its best light. And DG's recording is superlative, with just the right balance of clarity and reverb. And I thought Notre Dame was a tough space in which to record.My not-an-organist opinion? Buy this set.

"These mostly excellent, late-1970s performances of Beethoven's two masses would make a fine addition to any music collection. Strange that I never encountered them in their earlier guise on LP (or CD, either).Special notice goes to tenor Robert Tear, who sings really well in both works, especially the D Major. I've not always been a fan of his singing, which can tend to get stuck in his throat, with too many glottal attacks used to start phrases and to enter the high range. But here, he sounds very conventional in the best sense of the word (perhaps because neither work calls for the solo tenor to scale the high range. That's left up to the poor tenors in the chorus!).Over all, I prefer Sir Colin's later remake of the MS on RCA, which features a better chorus and soloists and a more-flattering acoustic, not to mention digital sound that is pretty much state of the art.Still, for the price - recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWL23T4CRXEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000416J#wasThisHelpful","RYWL23T4CRXEF","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rio Bravo is simply one of the best-crafted Westerns one will ever encounter, and that's taking into consideration that the story line provides a bare minimum on which to hang the entire film.Director Howard Hanks has the full measure of the genre and his incredible cast, who to a person provide high entertainment value. Can one really blame him for remaking this film as ""El Dorado"" a few years later (and pulling off perfection yet AGAIN in the process!)?As much as John Wayne is great in ""Quiet Man"" and ""The Searchers,"" he's really enjoyable here, with his easy and audience-inviting manner of ""reacting"" more than acting. Dean Martin is superb, as is Angie Dickenson, who defines what it means to be quietly smoldering. Yowza!Rio Bravo is one of those films you can watch over and over again and never tire of. The BluRay transfer is excellent, with special mention to the soundtrack also being cleaned up and improved.A note on the pricing: after being unavailable domestically for a few years - and with third-party sellers asking ridiculous prices - the BluRay of Rio Bravo was re-released in the USA on June 2, 2015, and is now available from Amazon for under $10.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EUIHT4SQ9LPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THZUSR4#wasThisHelpful","R2EUIHT4SQ9LPD","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent product that fit the bill at our new digs, where my BluRay player sits quite a ways away from my flat screen TV. It's a heavy duty cable that's nicely and loosely wrapped in a coil. The right-angle adapter came in handy in securing the cable to the back of my wall-mounted flat screen TV. I'd also mention that the cable comes with a separate keychain flashlight that my son grabbed for his use.Note: I am experiencing audio drop outs on my TV set speakers using these long cable runs. The video is fine, but the audio will roll off and come back intermittently. And, the problem doesn't arise on all chapters on a specific BluRay - the extras may play just fine, but the main show has the problem. Weird. A friend of mine who is an audio techie says it's a common problem with long HDMI cable runs. Fortunately, there are no problems with the audio feed going from my Panasonic BD player to my pre-amp (using a 3-foot RCA cable), so I can mitigate the drop out problem by simply using my stereo set up for audio playback and turning off the speakers on my TV.

"Sorry to be the bearer of VERY bad news, friends, but I am obliged to report that the 2014 remaster of these EMI recordings by Warner is quite decent on three of the discs, while an absolute disaster on the fourth (it's especially painful as I make this report on the 25th anniversary to the day that Karajan was lost to the ages).That fourth disc is CD #3 in the set, which contains Symphonies 4 & 5. I know these recordings very, very well. I have owned the 4th & 5th Symphonies in this set on Angel USA LPs and cassettes, British and German EMI LPs, the initial EMI ""Studio"" CDs and finally, the remaster that EMI did for their 2008 Complete Karajan box set, which I assume was the same master that graced their 2-CD Double Forte issue, which I also owned. All of these versions presented the sound of the Berlin Philharmonic under Karajan as I remembered from my encounters with them at Carnegie Hall: warm, blended, colorful, with the ability to crescendo to incredible fortissimos without the sound ever gaining an unpleasant and unnecessary ""edge.""I ordered this Warner set with the expectation that the sound would basically stay about the same as always, with maybe a slight uptick in the clarity of the inner voices, a smidgen more hall ambience and maybe a little more lifelike quality in the instrumental color.That isn't what we've got here when it comes to the 4th and 5th Symphonies.What we've got is a reimagining of these recordings that would have probably driven Karajan apoplexic. The basic warm and atmospheric quality of these analogue recordings has been jettisoned for an edgy and LOUD presentation that bears no resemblance to the way these recordings always sounded on EMI, and even less resemblance to the way these artists sounded in the concert hall. It's as if the engineers have decided that, ""people think Karajan's recordings are mushy, right? We'll fix that! We'll boost the volume and increase the high partials so every strand of the recording sticks out like a HIP enthusiast's wet dream! We can do it! Now, turn those knobs and dials!!!""Now, there's an easy fix for what Warner hath wrought: cut your treble gain by about 25% and maybe reduce the volume level while you're at it. With these corrections the CD sounded more like what I remember from its earlier EMI incarnations.The other three discs in the set are fine. The digital recordings included - Symphonies 1, 2 & 6, along with the Karelia Suite and Valse triste - sound about how they did in earlier issues. Maybe there's a bit more clarity to be had, but things are basically the same. The rest of the recordings - En saga, Finlandia, Tapiola and The Swan of Tuonela - feature good, remastered analogue sound, though I found that boosting my volume control brought an unwelcome edge to the sound that wasn't there in any of the earlier EMI versions. Warner offers no indication anywhere as to what recordings in this set are digital and which are analogue, a rather curious omission, to say the least.BTW - I see that Warner is planning on releasing all of these CDs as singles, utilizing the original LP artwork and bearing a sticker price of $26 PER CD (I assume these are SACDs)!

Maybe they'll take this opportunity to revisit their remaster of 4 & 5.These 5-star performances get knocked down to 3.5 stars for the botched sound offered on Syms 4 & 5 in this Warner set, even though one can enjoy even that particular CD if one does what I did and cuts their treble gain significantly - and maybe fiddles around with god-knows-what-else on their pre-amp.Coulda been a 5-star review, but you can't botch two MAJOR pieces in a set like this and expect not to be called on it.

"These recordings are excellent representations of the Abbado way with music. Everything is alive and beautifully played with details registering as needed. What's missing is that final sense of passion - granted, maybe an all-too-obvious passion, at that - that sets off the greatest cycles from the merely great.I would place this cycle behind Ormandy on Sony - also available at a budget price - and Karajan on DG, though Karajan's cycle must be heard in the latest OIBP mastering for best effect, and that's presently available only in the expensive ""Karajan 1970s"" box set. If you can afford or need only one Tchaikovsky cycle, then go with the Ormandy.That said, there are many fine options out there, including Muti and Maazel. But for the under-$20 asking price, this Abbado set should be a strong contender.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKH1RSZF68MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6P2ME#wasThisHelpful","R3TKH1RSZF68MH","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 28-CD set effectively presents Sir Neville Marriner's Argo label recordings - from his very earliest recordings, through the onset of the digital age - and serves as a nice remembrance of a man who turned 90 in April. Not being a Marriner aficionado, I have no idea what percentage of his entire Argo discography is represented by these 28 discs, but I would guess that it's substantial.The packaging is simple and sturdy. The outer box lifts off from the top, exposing a weighty paper box that houses the CDs. Every CD is presented in its original LP sleeve, though the discs themselves do not sport that unique shade of green that served as background to Argo LP labels, nor are the CDs given the now-ubiquitous LP surface look. It's nice to once again see the unassuming cover designs that graced Marriner's Argo LPs. A few pieces from shorter albums have been grafted on to some CDs to take advantage of CD playing lengths. Unfortunately, the original liner notes that featured on the back of the LP sleeves are missing, replaced with the most-rudimentary of track listings.The CD booklet includes all of the dates and recording venues for each CD, which is nice. A short article on Marriner and the ASMF appears in the back pages of the booklet.Included as ""bonus"" discs are Marriner's 1962 recordings made for the L'oiseau-Lyre label, along with three ASV (Academy Sound and Vision) productions that - I assume - were planned for release on Argo until Decca finally put the Argo imprimatur to rest: Weber Symphonies, ""The French Connection"" and ""The English Connection.""Edit: 7/3/14: I've now listened to the entire set, and I'm happy to report that the sound is fairly spectacular - open, colorful, well-blended and direct. Disc 6 contains the famous Four Seasons recording - very nice to hear this again after maybe 20 years. It really is excellent, as is the recording of Vivaldi's ""La Stravaganza.""I can recommend this wholeheartedly, holding back one star for the lack of liner notes and the non-complete nature of the set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCSZXH4SOZUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IERAFUQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCSZXH4SOZUG","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say straight out that the Bach recordings of John Eliot Gardiner are absolute anathema to my musical sensibilities, and that I find 90% of HIP performances of Baroque choral music to be wimpy, neutered and irritating beyond belief. Overwrought speed and faceless singing have nothing to do with Baroque style - or ANY style - IMHO.When it comes to Bach's B Minor, it gets even worse. The only HIP recording I like out of the lot is Harnoncourt's first version  on Teldec. There's a lot of solo singing in the B Minor, and it better be good, because it's demanding. And the choruses are no slouch, either. The chorus better be damn good, because there's a lot of expressive music contained in this piece.Which brings us to Robert Shaw's masterful, Grammy-Award-winning, RCA Living Stereo version of the B Minor. It is - in a word - tremendous, and tremendous on every level. Soloists, great - check! Chorus, great - check! Orchestra is very, very good if not great, but it hardly matters. Shaw's interpretation? Distinctive, and about as unique as you could hope to find today in the cookie-cutter marketplace of HIP recordings of this piece. Shaw presents a point of view here. If you don't like it, it's your loss, not his.Make no doubt about it, this recording will engage your musical senses and leave you with a sense of fulfillment.I have to say that a number of my HIP-enjoying friends have had to admit that this recording bowled them over.I'd also mention that back in 1999, I offered this recording in the BMG Living Stereo packaging as a featured selection through the now-defunct Musical Heritage Society. We sold roughly 17,000 copies of this 2-CD set within the first 2 months of it being on sale. That at a time when retail sales of new releases by major classical artists were tallied in, at best, the high dozens. Not bad for selling a Bach mass to the masses, wouldn't you say?Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVH0L9XPQCAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001R3MY#wasThisHelpful","RVH0L9XPQCAT","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American-born soprano Anna Moffo's (1932-2006) RCA recordings always fall easily on the ear. Her voice possessed a sexiness that matched her physical beauty (said physical beauty earned her the moniker ""La Bellissima"").This album is no exception, though the rep itself is something of a stretch for her vocally (and many of these selections were rarities of a sort when she set down this album in 1962). Moffo's lyric instrument didn't possess the long-breathed stamina nor the power of her spinto contemporaries Leontyne Price and Martina Arroyo. If you're familiar with those singers in these and other Verdi selections, you may find Moffo a bit limited in the expression, variety and depth that she can bring to this weightier repertoire. What she did possess, however, was a voice that brought you in as a listener and caressed you with a warmly feminine and non-stentorian sound, and that aspect of her art shines a very different light on these selections. No problem, as Verdi is a big boy and his music can easily stand up to a variety of approaches.The voice is enjoyable to listen to here, even if it's more naturally suited to Puccini and the lighter Verdi roles like Gilda and Violetta. While it's nice to hear Moffo singing arias from, say, Otello and Ernani, you won't find yourself wishing that she had recorded those operas in their entirety.Still, it's good to have this album back in the catalog in *its* entirety. Moffo's recording career spanned two decades, and this album was recorded when she was arguably at the height of her power and popularity. Her art is best heard in the Rome-based recordings of complete operas she made for RCA - Madama Butterfly, La Traviata, La boheme, Rigoletto, etc - which feature casts one would have heard at The Met back in the day.BTW - the whole ""collaboration"" thing with the conductor doesn't count for much at this late date. Most people who buy this album are going to be scratching their heads over that marketing ploy (ie: no one is buying this album for the conductor).Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLFLSD3YE4Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN1FJLO#wasThisHelpful","R3LLFLSD3YE4Y1","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rene Leibowitz's fabled Beethoven Symphony cycle with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra makes a welcome reappearance as a costs-next-to-nothing MP3 download. Recorded in - I believe - 1961 for LP release on Reader's Digest, in recent decades the cycle has also appeared on CDs from Reader's Digest, Menuet, Scribendum and Chesky.This cycle is renown for the energetic playing of the orchestra, in large part because Leibowitz opts for fairly fast tempi in the Allegros and an overall objective approach when it comes to matters of rubato. The orchestral playing is very good, even if one can occasionally quibble with the sound coming from various choirs at various times (I'm not that enamored of the solo oboist, for example). There are also occasions of loose ensemble playing, some of it quite obvious. It's what you'd expect from a cycle that didn't have the benefit of multiple retakes. Whether these problems irritate over the long haul is an individual thing.It isn't at all a stretch to say that Leibowitz anticipates the HIP movement to a certain extent in these recordings, though the ghost of Toscanini hovers writ large over the proceedings, even though Leibowitz was a very vocal critic of Toscanini's approach to Beethoven.While Leibowitz is forward looking in his choice of tempi, he embraces the 1960s zeitgeist when it comes to matters of first-movement repeats - which is to say he's a bit cavalier in their observation, playing the first movement repeats only in symphonies 1, 5, 6 & 8, while ignoring the repeat in the Finale of the 5th. No big deal - such selective practice was the norm in performances and recordings at the time this set was committed to disc. Speaking of tempos, I can't say I'm a fan of Leibowitz's race through the instrumental *recitativo* in the Finale of the 9th. More ""recitativo"" and less ""but in tempo"" works better for me.I've been acquainted with these recordings since I purchased them on Reader's Digest stereo LPs back in 1970. They don't wear out their welcome, even if they ultimately sit just outside of any top ten list one might put together. Their main fault is that Leibowitz's objectivity tends to narrow the set's virtues - while its virtues are front-and-center and always enjoyable, repeat hearings don't necessarily reveal new layers of interest, as do, say, Toscanini's recordings. The Ninth is particularly enjoyable (*pace!* my comment above), featuring an excellent solo quartet (Inge Borkh, Ruth Stewart, Richard Lewis and Ludwig Weber) and chorus (Beecham Choral Society) who are well-balanced into the soundstage of the recording.The sound of the MP3 is very, very good, with a nice hall ambience that mirrors what I've heard on hard media over the decades. There are, however, a few glitches here and there that would probably cause one to exchange a CD for a new copy, had one paid CD prices for the recordings. At $1.09 for the entire cycle PLUS a whole lot more, it's easier to dismiss the glitches as incidental and unimportant distractions to one's basic listening pleasure: if you're listening to these while exercising, said glitches are no more distracting than that dog barking off in the distance.I highly recommend this download: 4 stars, holding back one star for the aforementioned glitches.BTW - if you find that you like this cycle so much that you want to own it on CD, I recommend going for the inexpensive ""Menuet"" versions. They seem to stay in the catalog, while others go oop and start costing an arm and a leg. I owned both the Menuet set AND the Chesky set at one time. When it came time to opt for one, I ended up keeping the Menuet version. I simply found it better overall than the Chesky. So, save your money and your valuable time: go for the Menuet versions. Better yet, bide your time - someone else is sure to reissue this set on CD at a budget price sometime in the near future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDO1JAFDH569P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWNY1QA#wasThisHelpful","RDO1JAFDH569P","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the fortune of hearing the Mahler 9th performed any number of times in the concert hall. My first experience was with Bernard Haitink conducting the Cleveland Orchestra at Severance Hall in the 1970s. My next time was hearing Karajan and the Berlin Phil at Carnegie Hall in 1981. I heard Maazel and Cleveland play it at Carnegie in 1982, and lastly, Dohnanyi and Cleveland at the NJPAC in Newark in the late 1990s. Each one of those performances were very special - similar in many respects, yet also individual and different.None of those performances featured the kind of histrionics found in Bernstein's various versions. All of them played the score *as music,* without a non-musical subtext hitting one over the head. I have to say that I rather like that approach, because if there's one thing Mahler DOESN'T need it's help goosing up the histrionics.This DG production is a very accurate reflection of the performance I heard at Carnegie Hall, though it was recorded in Berlin. The beauty of the orchestral playing is stunning, and the interpretation is unique and very satisfying. Unlike Bernstein and others, Karajan doesn't try to blow you away with every movement. He realizes that most symphonies have ONE main climax, and he builds to that climax. Karajan pays meticulous attention to the subtleties of Mahler's score, executing Mahler's myriad changes of dynamics and tempi with both nuance and high precision. As much as I like Bernstein in this piece, Karajan is more adept at giving us what Mahler actually wrote in the score, rather than overly personalizing the music. I'll say it again - the beauty of the orchestral sound is a highlight of this recording. Considering that this is a ""live"" recording, it's amazing to consider the confidence conductor and orchestra have in each other to play the way they do. And, I have to say that Karajan is more successful at pulling off the Second Movement than are others. It all sounds logical in his hands, possibly because - again - he takes a more-nuanced approach that is very respectful of Mahler's musical signposts.What really makes Karajan special in this piece is his treatment of the denouement that follows that climax. There's an inevitability about the Finale in this recording that provides the answer to the three movements that preceded said finale - those movements find their resolution in the finale, as it were. While I found the Finale of Karajan's analog studio recording of this piece quite good, I felt that other parts of that recording were less successful. No problem with that here.This is music making on a very, very high level, so I'm not surprised to read the many glowing reviews of this recording. Neither am I surprised to read the few negative reviews - some people just don't get it. Or, as pianist Israela Margelit once told me, most critics live mediocre lives, and they're most comfortable with the mediocre. They don't understand greatness any more than they understand the truly bad, so they see the great as it if were bad.This recording IS great. Ignore the naysayers and try the recording for yourself.Again, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKWLHH80RBOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GK9#wasThisHelpful","R1MKWLHH80RBOJ","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why on earth did Decca not include ALL of Blomstedt's San Francisco SO legacy in this box? He recorded the complete Sibelius & Nielsen Symphonies with the SFSO, and both are highly recommended and highly sought out sets. Yet, here we get only one-CD worth of each composer. It would have taken all of 5 more CDs to include the complete symphony cycles of both composers.And where's the Schubert 5 & 8 and Rosamunde? Where's Ein Heldenleben & Metamorphosen? Bruckner 6? Where's Also sprach, Till and T & V? The Sessions/Harbison CD? What about the other Hindemith disc (Noblissima Visione, Der Schwanendreher & Concert Music)? Am I missing anything? Hello, Decca. Anyone home? That's at least 6 more discs worth of Blomstedt/SFSO recordings that are missing from this box.Honestly, you wonder what people at the record labels are thinking these days. This set looks to be aimed at least in part at completists, yet it isn't complete. In fact, it contains about half of what was recorded by Decca in SF during Blomstedt's ""San Francisco Years.""Universal has no problem issuing complete sets of recordings by artists who recorded far more for them than did Blomstedt (Karajan & Bernstein, for example). Sure, they're more popular than Blomstedt, but isn't that the point? Why not make it a complete Blomstedt and have done with it?Lame.

"These recordings are of both historical and musical interest. How could they be otherwise? They're the first recordings of a man who 25 years after his death still evokes praise, scorn and indifference among music lovers.The performances have both the hallmarks of a young musician looking to make his interpretive mark on the world and the musical traits that came to be Karajan trademarks over the decades. A well-balanced, well-developed orchestral sound that was his own, coupled with interpretations that are mainstream. The youthful indulgences on display here - the occasional unwritten rallentando, the stretching of a rest to achieve clarity, etc - are just that, youthful. These are gestures that were eventually dropped from the Karajan ethos in favor of an approach that elevated the forest - rather than the trees - of musical interpretation.The sound is generally good, better than I expected, though the top end can become a bit shrill and the winds don't have the greatest presence.Seen with 20/20 hindsight, these recordings were the start of something big, that big being the eventual career that Karajan carved out for himself. Would that career have happened were these recordings all one had to go on in determining musical value and interest? No. Would that something big have happened had EMI not promoted Karajan so heavily in the 1950s? No. Still, when viewed through the prism of today, these recordings do display traits that one can see as being echt-Karajan, even at these early dates. And, they are highly musical performances that can be enjoyed without the need to toss about the caveats one often sees when discussing performances from early in a musician's career.Ultimately, this is a set for Karajan fans only. And even that's a stretch - I'm a pretty big fan, and even I didn't bother picking up this set until it dropped below $10 on amazon. For me, this set rounds out my near-complete Karajan collection. For most others, acquiring these recordings can hardly be a priority.Recommended for fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QEHIME95XEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBHSQ8#wasThisHelpful","R1QEHIME95XEU","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No doubt about it, this is a once-in-a-lifetime performance of the 9th.Yes, there are a lot of warts, big and small. Yes, the performance is highly indulgent, especially with the addition of those ""sul ponticello"" effects in the first movement. Yes, the trombones miss their big entry in the finale.Yet all things considered, this is a performance that demands to be heard at least once. Ignoring it amounts to one committing a serious sin of omission, of sustaining a self-inflicted musical wound, as it were.It may not be your way with Mahler or even Mahler's way with Mahler, but it's a committed performance of an interpretation straight out of the genius camp...or the looney bin, in equal parts. Take your pick.Definitely not a Mahler 9 to be listened to casually (is it ever?), and probably not the Mahler 9 you'll pull down from the shelf all that often, but a Mahler 9 that you'll feel better off for having heard.*The sound is slightly improved in this single-CD ""Originals"" remastering when compared to the 2-CD set issued back in 1992.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12049CGMNCC4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UIWSL4#wasThisHelpful","R12049CGMNCC4X","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Sony RCA ""Masters"" libretto-less version of this Ring last year (ASIN: B006XOBFJC), the one that says on the back of the box that it was produced with a 24-bit process. I really liked the sound on that version, and I'm particularly fond of the bang-up job done by Ren Kollo as Siegfried. He's simply the best Siegfried available in any of the studio Rings.I have just purchased this Eurodisc/Sony ""deluxe"" version of the Ring, mainly because I found it elsewhere for $25, which is about what you'd pay to get the included Stewart Spencer English translation separately (bought it for the translation and packaging, got the music for free!). This presented me with an opportunity to A-B test the two versions to see if there was any difference in the sound.I did this by blind testing the versions against each other. I picked the ""Dawn Duet & Rhine Journey"" from Götterdämmerung as my test - about 10 minutes worth of music that goes from pianissimo to fortissimo and includes some singing as well. I sat down with my Dover score and listened to the selection straight through on one version, followed by the other version, not knowing which was which.The results? Well, the versions definitely sounded different to my ears. The second version I listened to had slightly greater clarity and a slightly more-open sound stage. The extended clarinet solos in the Dawn prelude sounded a hair more realistic in the second version. The instrumental color was more spot on. Compared to the second version, the first version seemed a bit cloudy. The second version also featured a slightly firmer bass end. I felt the voices were slightly forward-balanced in the first version, more integrated into the picture in the second version without losing any presence.Also - and this is important - there was absolutely no change in volume as I moved between the two discs. Often times when CDs are remastered the engineers transfer them at a slightly higher volume level which people then mistake as the disc having more presence or clarity, even though you can get the same effect by just turning up the volume on your old disc. At least I was able to remove that as a variable.Opening the carousel after listening, it turned out that the first version I heard was this Eurodisc version, the second was the RCA Masters version, the one with the 24-bit logo on the back of the box. The 24-bit version did sound slightly better.Does this mean anything? I don't know. I didn't expect to hear any difference at all between the two versions, both of which have a reissue (P)-date of 2012. But I definitely heard a slight difference. I've always assumed the 24-bit thing on the back of these Sony boxes is a marketing gimmick, ie: taking advantage of the fact that 24-bit mastering consoles are the norm in CD production these days, and promoting it like it means something. Only in this case, it seems to mean something.The key operating word here is ""slightly.""I'll need to spot check around the rest of the cycle to see if my evaluation holds up.My recommendation at this point would be to get the RCA Masters version if you want the best sound; get the Eurodisc version for the beautiful packaging and sound that is only slightly less good.On edit: 1/12/15 - AND...I now own THREE copies of this Janowski Ring, as it is included in the super-budget, 40-CD ""Richard Wagner: Great Recordings"" box Sony issued in February 2013. That set is going for UNDER $16 on amazon these days and represents the cheapest way to pick up this Janowski cycle. I haven't had time to audition those particular CDs, so I am assuming that the Eurodisc mastering is the one included there, as the covers to the included CDs are the Eurodisc versions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCSX0FN14NLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EJSV2C#wasThisHelpful","R1OCSX0FN14NLP","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 4-DVD set offers 4 WWII movies whose naval-oriented subject matter is a bit off the beaten track.""Sink the Bismarck!"" is probably the best known out of the quartet, and it features good acting all-around, a compelling story and a nice musical score.

B&W but shot in Cinemascope.""The Frogmen"" is a B&W movie I remember from my youth. A very young Richard Widmark has the lead role, with Dana Andrews and Jeffrey Hunter in secondary roles. It's the story of the Underwater Demolition Teams operating in the Pacific. This is a straight-forward action flick with little time spent on personality conflicts, outside of that between Widmark's character and the frogmen team - he's replacing their recently KIA leader. Aspect ratio is 4/3. Good stuff.""The Enemy Below"" is the only color movie in this set. It's a compelling cat-n-mouse picture that toes a familiar line: my enemy is just as smart if not smarter than me. A US Destroyer chases a German U-boat across the South Atlantic. By the end of the movie, both ships are ablaze and both crews are rescued and united in a mutual respect, proving that the men sent to fight wars and the peoples at war often have very different takes on the nitty gritty of war.I'm a bit embarrassed to report that I had never even heard of the Marlon Brando thriller ""Morituri."" In fact, this movie is the reason I purchased this set - I caught the movie about 1/4 of the way in on TMC last week and really liked the story and the telling. That inspired me to look for the film at amazon, and voila! here it is! Besides Brando's excellent portrayal of a German undercover agent working for the Brits to commandeer a shipment of rubber bound to Germany, the rest of the cast is top-drawer, including Wally Cox (aka the voice of the cartoon character ""Underdog""), who makes a rare acting appearance as a German doctor. Yul  Brenner plays the ship captain, and the German roles in the cast are filled out by a number of actors who always seem to crop up in war films from this era, among them, Martin Kosleck, Eric Braeden and Hans Christian Blech, not to mention George Takei in a very early film role.There's really nothing in the way of extras on this discs outside of trailers.I purchased this DVD set firm in my assumption that none of these films is going to be released on BluRay any time soon.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCU0DV8WNBJ6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EMGJFE#wasThisHelpful","RCU0DV8WNBJ6L","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a very easy read and an excellent place to start one's journey if they are on the cusp of seeking to move away from a religionist's view of the world into a view based more upon reason and empirical evidence.It's important to recognize that Stenger has set out to ""show"" that god doesn't exist, not to ""prove"" god doesn't exist (a task that is really not achievable - one can't prove a negative, especially when that negative is an invisible supernatural being who may or may not reside in the reality we all deal with every day). It's a semantic difference, but an important one. To Stenger's credit, he is clear that this book is an exercise in arguing the non-existence of god from the ""lack of evidence"" perspective. Paraphrasing Donald Rumsfeld, Stenger avers that absence of evidence can be evidence of absence, at least in the case of god.Stenger creates a model to explore the god hypothesis, basing that model on the traits the major religions assign to their concept of what constitutes god (though let's be honest, Stenger's contact point to religion is 95% Christianity, with other religions given only fleeting reference). This has the advantage of eliminating the whack-a-mole debate one gets into with religionists/philosophers when their vision of god goes off the rails to include alien beings, the ultimate consciousness...or, The Force. Let's face it, when most people talk about THEIR god, they're talking about the god that was indoctrinated into them by one of the major religions when they were only children, not alien beings or The Force. Might as well keep the conversation where it belongs.Science doesn't usually deal in absolutes, and so it is with Stenger's subtitle: ""how science shows god doesn't exist."" What Stenger shows is that science has so reduced the need for the idea of god that god is basically hiding out in the gaps, if not already dead, awaiting his demise, holding on by his fingernails as the lack of empirical and even theoretical evidence reduce the chances of his existing to a statistical improbability. So, while one could say that science shows god doesn't exist based on Stenger's model, it doesn't show every possibility out there of what might be considered to be ""god"" doesn't exist. How could it?Best thing about this book? The scientists have thrown off Stephen Jay Gould's belief that religion and science are non-overlapping magesteria, and are finally claiming ground in the ""why are we here?"" argument.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TNJ4CSNYNFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591026520#wasThisHelpful","R7TNJ4CSNYNFJ","A2KI1SGCZT2OEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI1SGCZT2OEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I received a bag of these in exchange for my honest review. I do not 'reward' companies with positive reviews when I receive a free product. I am inserting this disclaimer because there has been a lot of hype about fake reviews lately, and some folks seem to think Vine Reviews are in this category. My reviews are all honest, whether I pay for a product or not.Review:Personally I loved these clusters. I love the crunch, and the flavor is fresh and light. I have had a lot of dried fruits, both the standard, and freeze dried. It appears some folks do not care for the texture of these. When fruits are freeze dried however, this is the texture you get. I happen to love it. When you bite into them, there is a burst of fruity crunchiness. If you chew them up pretty quickly, you get to experience that texture throughout. If you chew slowly and let them sit in your mouth for awhile, they become similar to cotton candy, as they sort of melt into a small soft fraction of the size they were. I like to eat them both ways. If I had to compare them to something a lot of people have tried, I'd say, Imagine the fruity pieces of Captain Crunch Berries, but fresher, lighter, and not so sickening sweet.Ingredient wise, they are simply made of raspberries, apples, fruit pectin, and apple juice. No preservatives, no artificial colors or flavors. They are not of course as healthy as whole fresh raspberries and apples, but then again they are not as unhealthy as the vast majority of other fruit snacks out there.I would have given five stars if the price was better. At the time of this review, eight bags will run you $29.96. That comes to approximately $3.75 per bag. There are 3 skimpy servings per bag. My husband and I ate the bag all in one sitting, and he could have easily eaten a couple of bags himself.In summary, I love the taste and texture of these little fruit bites. I have had a lot of freeze dried fruits, and although these aren't my all time favorite, they do rank highly. If they were a better price I would have given five stars. Because of the cost though, I will not buy them for myself and a star gets taken away.Personally I'd rather have a fresh piece of fruit, but for the 'convenience/snack' niche these are supposed to fill, I think they do a good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39Y5MKGA5TTAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAFMKLW#wasThisHelpful","R39Y5MKGA5TTAW","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just listened to this for the first time and I Love, Love, Love it! I saw that he was going to be singing it on tonight's episode of The Voice, but I just couldn't wait!I was a bit surprised because it's a bit more up tempo than a lot of his stuff. But there is no doubt who is singing the song. You get to hear that old-soul, bluesy style that is unmistakable Sawyer. One of my favorite things about this song (and others on the album) is that the sound of his voice comes through clearly. By that, I mean that the background music does not steal the show. as is often the case when producers get too excited about the bling. (Sorry producers, but this is a pet peeve of mine)...we don't want the voice to be a little part of what you hear, in the midst of all the clang/bang of background music. We want the voice to be the focus, especially when that voice is Sawyer's. And with this song you definitely get that!Bottom line, Sawyer clearly owns this song. I really hope it becomes a huge hit. I am looking forward to seeing him sing it live on the Voice tonight!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEHO43ONTIBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017SCHSH0#wasThisHelpful","RNEHO43ONTIBE","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have many tops and pants in the Cuddl Duds fleece, and I love them all. Most of them I get at Walmart at about $6 cheaper, but I liked this blue color so I bought it here. In person, the color is a little more teal than the blue shown in the picture, but it is still a nice color.The fabric is the softest, coziest thing I have ever felt against my skin, and I live in it all winter. I wear this brand of fleece both for daytime clothes and for pajamas. This particular top is almost exactly like the ones at Walmart, except for one small difference. The tops from W... have a thumb hole at the end of the sleeve. The hole is great for keeping your sleeves down when layering on another article of clothing. This top from Amazon does not have the hole. Instead, there is an embroidered icon of some sort (maybe CD for Cuddl Duds)? The icon looks nice and adds a bit of what may be considered 'bling' to a simple fleece gal like myself. Personally I'd rather have the thumb hole, but that minor issue is not enough to take any stars away. I absolutely love this top and it seems to be well made, in addition to being comfortable.One final note about washing instructions....the label says cold water, gentle cycle. I do not do that. I use warm wash, cold rinse (regular cycle) and it works fine. I have been doing this ever since I got my first fleece Cuddl Duds over a year ago and they all look as good as the day I got them. Also, some folks do not use fabric softener on fleece. I do. I tried the foil ball in the dryer, but it did not work, I still got static cling on these. So I went back to using dryer sheets and all is well. Also, my laundry detergent has fabric softener in it and I have no problems. I use the Ecos Brand detergent from Costcos and this line of fleece comes out looking great every time. Some of my Cuddl Duds have probably been washed 40+ times, and still look good. I'm not saying do what I do, I'm just saying I'm a bit careless about the washing instructions and have not had any issues.Bottom line, I love this fleece. I'm thinking of moving to the Arctic Circle so I can wear my Cuddl Duds in the summer too!

"First let me say that I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Despite the recent attention that has been given to so called 'paid reviews' not being legitimate, that is not the case here. The items we ""Viners"" receive for free are taxable to us, and we are honest in our opinions. If you search my reviews, you will see that the 'free' items I review do not always get a favorable rating. I have given one star, five stars, and everything in-between.Ok, disclaimer over, here's my honest opinion of this iron:To be short and sweet, I absolutely Love it! I am a quilter and currently have four irons. This is my favorite. I love so many things about it, so I'll address one at a time:Steam Function:This works perfectly. You can adjust how much steam you want to use, and of course you can adjust whether it comes out of the the bottom plate, or you can do a direct spray from the handle area. Both work like a charm. No sputtering, no dripping, just perfectly misted steam every time.Heat Settings:The heat settings on this are digital rather than a turn dial. I honestly don't care whether my setting are chosen digitally or with a dial, as long as it works. This works. As far as the heat settings go, I really like a good hot iron for pressing my quilting cotton, both before cutting, and when pressing seams. The cotton setting is nice and hot, the perfect amount of heat for my quilting fabric. My first test was this: I took a scrap of fabric, folded it in half and pressed it just to test the sharpness of the fold. I have to say, that was the sharpest fold I have ever seen. It was all I could do to unfold it and lay it somewhat flat on my ironing board again. Then came the next test...I wanted to press out the fold and have the scrap perfectly flat again. A dry pressing didn't do it, but when I shot it with steam, that's all it took. Absolutely no indication that there was ever a fold pressed in the fabric. Part of this effectiveness I believe has to do with the weight of the iron...I cover that a bit more further down. This is impressive to me, because with a couple of my other irons I really have to press and re-press to get those fold lines completely out, even with steam.Soleplate:This is probably my favorite part of the iron. It is extremely smooth, and glides over my fabric like a dream. Not only that, the pointy part of the soleplate is shaped in a way that I can get into tight seam areas better than I can with any of my other irons. It is very 'corner friendly', and precise pressing is definitely the result.Weight:This is not my lightest iron, so I was initially concerned about that. But I find that the slightly heavier weight was in no way a hindrance. In fact, I feel the weight adds to how effectively the iron smooths out those wrinkles!All in all, I feel this is an impeccable iron. Granted, I am usually fairly pleased with most irons, but this one definitely outshines them all. I hope to get lots of use from this, and if anything negative turns up I will be sure to update this review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U40BM3VK826R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R3U40BM3VK826R","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive cheese board. There are little rubbery feet on the four corners that keep it from slipping, and the size is just right for my purposes.Although the design is beautiful, I assumed the background was white like the photo. It is clear, and therefore the red cardinal does not have the same striking impact as what the photo shows. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. After closer inspection of the photo, I can only assume that it is difficult to impart a 'clear' background photographically.

"I was so excited to try this. I usually cook from scratch due to the lack of good quality, organic food that is already prepared. I live in a rural area where these types of conveniences are hard to come by....our store has mostly just the basic, GMO laden, MSG filled products.When I saw this organic soup I was hopeful that I found something to get me through those occasions when a 'scratch' soup wasn't feasible.To be blunt, I only ate two bites, then threw it away. When I took the first bite, I thought, Yuck...this tastes just like the processed stuff our store already sells. Then I thought, no, surely it's not that bad; so I took another bite. That's when I realized that yes, it was that bad. If I had to describe the taste, I'd say it was like eating something that came from a malfunctioning Star Trek food replicator. I threw the rest of that batch away and gave the other unopened cartons to my neighbor.To be fair, I am very used to my own awesome soups. I guess an unrealistic part of me was expecting an 'organic' soup to taste less processed. Lesson learned, this is a processed soup even if it is organic.That being said, if you are already used to eating soups that are canned or processed in any way, you may not be too put off by this.But if you do a lot of homemade, don't expect the 'organic' label to bring you home cooked flavor. I generously gave three stars in case I'm being overly critical. My honest opinion is probably more like two stars, and that's only because of it's merits of being organic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY24OL7GLAN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DUYK90#wasThisHelpful","R3HY24OL7GLAN3","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for two reasons: It had dough hooks, and the price was right. I figured if it didn't work well I wouldn't be out much.I had recently seen a more expensive brand with dough hooks on a shopping channel, but their price was about five times the cost of this one.I'm so glad I took the chance! I make a lot of homemade bread, and was tired of using my kitchenaid stand mixer. The bowl on that isn't really big enough for 2-3 loaves worth of dough, and so the dough just kept crawling up the blade and hit the main arm of the mixer. I kept having to scrape it down, and I finally quit using it altogether for dough....it was easier to hand knead.Then the shopping channel demo on the 'other brand' hand mixer convinced me it would be great to have one with dough hooks. It would allow me to mix in a bigger bowl, and be able to just move the whole mixer around so it would get to all the dough in the bowl. To make a long story short, this mixer works GREAT!I begin with sourdough starter, and I find that when it's still pretty thin it's easier to just spoon-stir it. Then when the flour additions start thickening everything up, I use this hand mixer. Once the dough is at it's working consistency, it works best to run the mixer for a bit in one section, move the mixer slightly and run in another section, etc. Everything gets really mixed in this way. After the initial dough 'resting' phase, I use the mixer again for a five minute kneading, moving from section to section. For most of my kneading I just use the first or second speed and it works perfectly. No bogging down at all.Finally bread making is a pleasure again! Bottom line, this is probably the best $13 purchase I've ever made! (Actually it was $12.83, I think.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5GHRI0KDA8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XCCULW#wasThisHelpful","R3R5GHRI0KDA8H","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"See Additional comment below this original review:Original Review: This is a beautiful set of towels, mitts, and potholders. I got the chef print, and the yellow is a soft, yet deep buttery color that matches my kitchen perfectly.The first thing I did when I received them, was put them through a wash. I wanted to see how they would hold up. Color wise, there was definitely some fading, but they still look really pretty. Structurally, the towels are very thin, and after that one wash I can tell that they will not last long. They are a bit of a loose weave, and almost every towel had pulled threads/snags by the time I took them out of the dryer. They look to be in about the same condition as towels I have had for the last 8-10 years.That being said, I love the oven mitts & potholders. The mitts are a bit smaller than any of my other ones, which is a benefit in my opinion. They are less cumbersome than large bulky mitts, and are easy to get on & off. They have plenty of thickness to them, and they fully insulate my hands from hot dishes.I rarely buy new kitchen towels, as I tend to keep the same color scheme for years. But mine were getting old, and these were offered to me for free in exchange for my honest review. Since they matched my colors so I was glad to try them out. If I were to see this set in a store I would be able to tell that the towels are pretty thin, but I would probably still buy the set. The Amazon price at the time of this review is at about $22.00. For six towels, two mitts, and two potholders, I think it's a fairly decent deal. If the towels hadn't snagged after just one washing, I would've given five stars.Additional Comments 8/28/14: Well, I reduced my rating to two stars. The potholders are both starting to come apart at the seams. The binding is coming apart and the fabric is fraying. I washed them once, and have only used them a few times as it has been too hot to cook much. I was pulling something out of the oven today when I noticed the fraying. I have had other potholders for years, and never had this problem. The dish towels look like regular dish towel fabric, but after using a few times I see that they are not as absorbent as any of my other towels. Even though the towels are thin, the nap is a bit stiff and the threads almost seem to have a water repellent property to them. Basically this is a cheaply made set, even though the design is really nice. I'm giving two stars instead of one, because I do love the design, and for those who have to pay for the set, at least the price is pretty low. Glad I got them for free!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RA19TXPK7RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKG17DM#wasThisHelpful","R14RA19TXPK7RT","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time trying this body cream, so I do not have any reference to how it compares with the old formula. All I know is, it is heavenly! I'm not a connoisseur of scents, so I don't know that I can be very eloquent in my description of it....but I will try:It has a soft, yet very rich scent, very nutty, and maybe a tad bit of vanilla & fig. I do not detect much of a fruity scent at all, unless you count the fig.Texture-wise, it is fluffy & light, very moisturizing without being overly oily.This is one of my favorite body creams. I tend to switch around a lot and I seldom come back to the same product once it's gone. This one however, will probably end up being one of my mainstays. Meaning, throughout all my switching around I will always have a jar of this available.

"These Chums are my favorite retainers ever! I love that they just slip onto the ends of the ear pieces. Unlike those rubber-bandy things that go way up on the sides of eyeglass ear pieces, these are way more understated and unobtrusive!These go on pretty easily, once they're on they stay on. I couldn't care less about the tips being fish shaped, but that certainly isn't a detriment either.To get away from the type of rubber-band retainers that go way up on the earpiece I ended up ordering these, as well as a pair of the Gripz brand retainers to try. I like these Chums a lot better, basically because the Gripz brand pulled at my hair too much when taking my glasses on and off.These 'Chums' are definitely going to work well for me.

"This was a bit hard to get used to, as I normally use the Hobbs Heirloom 80/20 fusible batting. I have come to realize that all fusible battings are very wrinkly out of the package, and you really need to smooth them out quite a bit before using them.The Hobbs fusible is much softer and more pliable than this June Tailor one, and it is easier to 'hand' smooth right off the bat. This June Tailor batting is way stiffer, but a little less wrinkly to start with.This batting says to steam press it, but I did not do that at first. I generally  prefer a dry iron, for reasons I won't get into here. So anyway, I used this batting on a wall hanging with applique. I proceeded to smooth the batting as much as I could, then I made my quilt sandwich. I pressed the back side first, then the front side, starting in the centers and gently smoothing as I went out. The result was a hard, warped wall hanging, that almost felt like it would break in half if I folded it. It didn't of course, but that's my way of explaining how stiff it was.I proceeded to quilt my wall hanging, and I re-planned my quilting to try and flatten the warped areas. That worked somewhat, but there was still warping. It almost looked like a curved platter. Low in the middle and all the edges curved up. I could've served tortilla chips in my wall hanging!Finally, I thought well, I'm gonna go ahead and steam it. My applique was securely sewn down and quilted by then. The result......MAGIC!I should've used steam in the first place. Everything flattened out perfectly, and it was even slightly less stiff. It reminded me of that plastic window stuff....you know for weather proofing? If you've ever used it, you know that when you run the blow dryer over it, all the warped areas magically flatten out. Well that's what the steam iron did. All the areas on my wall hanging that needed to be flat went flat, and all the areas that were already flat stayed exactly the same.I entered the wall hanging in our annual quilt show and got a blue ribbon! (Photo Shown).To sum up, I will explain the reason I only gave four stars instead of five. Bottom line, I like working with the Hobbs better. I like that it's more pliable, and that I don't have to use steam. All things considered, I feel the Hobbs it's just easier to work with. I will still use the Tailor brand in a pinch though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQ0J5O9U0661/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WKUTZC#wasThisHelpful","R2IQ0J5O9U0661","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am extremely bummed to have to give these shoes only 3 stars.First impression out of the box was that they felt very heavy, and very stiff. But no star deduction for that, I just figured they must be good solid shoes! I couldn't wait to try them on; Which is where my disappointment set in.First, I will say that I normally take a size 37 in these types of shoes, and in Dansko's I also take a 37. But based on various reviews, I decided it would be a good idea to order up one size in the Sanita's, so I did. I ordered a 38, and both shoes came stamped with 38.I put the left one on first. It was like putting my foot into a piece of formed concrete, but I was still able to slide my foot in fairly easily, and once on they were pretty comfortable (Very similar to Dansko's). The right shoe however would not even go on my foot. So then I put on a pair of thin hose to try and make it work, but I still could not get my foot in the shoe. I do not have wide feet, they are normal width and somewhat bony. The edge of the leather on the top part of the shoe, felt like a piece of iron jamming into my top foot bone. I think if I forced it any more it would have broken skin, or created a bruise.Finally I gave up. I held the shoes up against each other, and the right one did look slightly smaller than the left, but not much.After all this, I decided to experiment. I got a fairly new pair of my Dansko's out (size 37), and put the right one on. Then on my left foot, I put on this Sanita shoe (size 38). The Dansko 37 actually fit looser than the Sanita 38 shoe!So for me anyway, I assume a size 39 'might' work in the Sanita brand. I ended up boxing these up for a return though. I decided not to exchange them, because I really don't know for sure whether to go with 39's, or try another pair of 38's in hopes that they both match.And in case anyone is thinking maybe my feet are uneven, I will say that I am 57 years old, and I have bought many, many pairs of shoes over the years. I have never had a pair that were so mismatched size-wise.On a positive note, I did love the look of these in person. I do want to eventually try some more Sanita's, but I will wait until I can try them in person.Hopefully others will have more luck with these. I debated whether to give four stars instead of three, since everyone else seems to love these. But since I had no choice but to return them, I felt that the three star rating was generous enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WBLJIAM94QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EM66D18#wasThisHelpful","R11WBLJIAM94QT","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love everything about this baker. It's beautiful, it's sturdy, it cleans up easily, and it has cooked everything perfectly so far. There is no seasoning required, and the size is perfect for DEEP dish lasagna. I don't really need the length of a 13x9 for my lasagna, for just myself and my husband I'd rather have the depth. I put a lot of stuff in my layers!In fact, a lot of casserole pans are just too shallow in my opinion. So this is a refreshing option for those of us who like 'deep-dish' food!The only thing I was a bit surprised about is the weight of this pan. I know it's cast iron, and I know cast iron is heavy. I have several cast iron skillets, and a few other cast iron pieces. But for some reason, I just didn't expect this to be as heavy as it is. Maybe heavy skillets just aren't as big a deal for me, because I only use them on my stove top and do not have to do any bending while handling them. Others have commented on the weight in a favorable light, and I can understand their thinking. But when my joints are acting up, this is a bit uncomfortable to get in and out of the oven. Fortunately I have a strong husband though, so it's not much of an issue for me.But back to the positive.... so far I have used this for lasagna, baked chicken, and a couple of casseroles. It worked great every time, and I look forward to using it a lot more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CLA73UD4TYQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS7FCV8#wasThisHelpful","R3CLA73UD4TYQC","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are pros and cons to this vacuum, but all in all I like it and enjoy using it.Pros....Suction: Surprisingly, this little vacuum has great suction. I cannot believe how quickly the dirt collects in the canister. For bare floors, I can't set it on the lowest setting, or it sucks so much I can't drag it across my linoleum. But the second lowest setting works great.Weight: This is probably the thing I like most about this vacuum. Compared to my heavy duty vacuum cleaner, this one literally feels weightless! I do have a lightweight broom vac that I keep in my basement, but it does not have the suction that this one does.So to sum up the pros, the weight/suction ratio is tremendous; It's has the suction of my heavy duty vacuum, with the weight of my tiny broom vac.Cons....Flexible Hose: There is a plastic clamp-like thing on the front of the vacuum handle that the flexible hose attaches into. When using, the hose keeps falling out and I keep having to put it back. I'd tie it in permanently, but that would hinder my use of the attachments.Edge Cleaning: I should say ""NON Edge-Cleaning"", because no matter how I maneuvered the vac along the walls, etc, it did not clean the edges very well at all. My heavy duty vac easily excels in this area. If you want edge cleaning with this vacuum, you will definitely have to use the attachments.Those are my pros and cons. A few other notes to consider are: The cord is 19 feet long. I did not realize how short this was until I had to unplug/replug a few times when doing my living room. It is advertized at the 19 feet though, so this did not affect my rating. I have attached an extension cord that I will leave on it permanently.Also, the washable filter is easy to remove, wash, and reinsert. It does look a bit insubstantial though, so time will tell how long it lasts. If anything noteworthy arises concerning this, or any other issue I will update my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ATOZ5JSSG5FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGEW9CA#wasThisHelpful","R3ATOZ5JSSG5FX","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These scissors are great for both kids and adults. They are nice and small, easy for little hands to maneuver, yet the holes are made so that adults can use them too. Unlike my previous craft scissors, these scissors have one hole larger than the other. For me, I can easily fit my thumb in the small hole, and 2-3 fingers in the larger hole which allows for better control when cutting around tight curves.I have found these to be great for my sewing box. Being a quilter, I like to have a lot of these small scissors handy. I have a pair by my ironing board, a pair in my 'binding' box, a pair by my sewing machine, and a pair at my cutting table. I don't know that they would hold up to cutting several layers of fabric or anything, but I have rotary cutters for that. For paper cutting, light fabric cutting, applique, and crafts, these definitely do the job.Now that I am stocked up with these craft scissors, I expect to get a lot of use out of them.

"This replaces an older pair of bolt cutters we have. With our old ones, it takes a 'lot' more effort to get them to work.My husband has a taxidermy business and uses all kinds of cutters regularly. He often uses heavy gauge wire...just about every day actually. He also needs to change the length of a bolt periodically, and for all jobs these bolt cutters work wonders! Just before writing this review, he cut a bunch of six gauge wire, and he said they 'cut like butter'!He has used them to cut several things so far and we see no sign of nicks or dulling in the blades. They are truly heavy duty cutters!I also love the design of these cutters. They fold up nicely to save space, then they open easily and securely lock into place when you need to cut with them.Haha, he said I could have his old cheap bolt cutters for my craft room, to cut my floral wire with! You know, the stuff that you can bend a few times and then break? I declined his offer, but I may use these heavy duty ones once in awhile to cut heavier wire in his shop....just for the fun of it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RI2APA0Z5TMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GABZTPY#wasThisHelpful","R2RI2APA0Z5TMK","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this knife for free in exchange for my honest review. My husband is a taxidermist and a hunter, so I thought this would be a great product to try.When it arrived we immediately took it over to our shop and got out a tanned hide that needed prepping. He used the knife to thin a few areas on the nose pad. This was mainly just to test the sharpness of the blade, as fine shaving like this generally works better with small thin bladed knives. Nonetheless, he liked the way it worked and the blade seemed nice and sharp....to use my husband's words, he said ""Wow, super sharp!""Next, he took some scrap hide pieces and went into his salting room which is windowless. With the lights out in that room it is pretty dark. He had me to turn out the lights, then he proceeded to use the knife in the dark with only the 'knife-light' on.I'll just sum up quickly here by saying he is really excited about this knife. He can see extremely well in the dark when using it, the blade really is very sharp, and he is really excited to take it with him hunting next season.A hunter always hopes of course, to get their deer while there is still plenty of daylight, but you never know what circumstances you might run into. Even on just a dark cloudy day, the light on the knife would still be of help!Bottom line, even tho we received this for free, we feel it is definitely worth buying. Now that he's tried it, if he lost it, or it fell out of his pack or something, we would definitely pay $59 for another one (that is the price at the time of this review). Of all the things we have received to review over the last few years, this definitely ranks as one of our favorites!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B38F1SP880PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP3TOD6#wasThisHelpful","R2B38F1SP880PS","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work perfectly for both myself and my husband. I got the extra large for him, and the medium for me. My husband is a taxidermist so he wears gloves for certain jobs. He is able to feel through these and maintain his manual dexterity while protecting his hands. There is a slight texture which helps when he is working with anything wet or slippery.For me, I like to use them for cleaning house, coloring my hair, and clipping my doggie's hair in those special places that get 'dirty'. I have medium size female hands and the medium gloves fit perfectly. There is just a tiny bit of room in the fingertips, so a woman with longer fingers would probably like this size as well. These hold up nicely during use, and even though I received both sizes for free in exchange for my honest review, I would have no problem buying them when I run out. They are probably my favorite disposable gloves I've ever tried. And to put that in perspective, I did receive another brand of disposable gloves to review quite some time ago. I did not like those as well and did not give as favorable a review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWK5TENTSCWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGSGN46#wasThisHelpful","R3DWK5TENTSCWF","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these to use in the morning when I make smoothies with my VitaMix. A little background.....My Vitamix wasn't blending very well, so I called the company. I was told I needed to start it on low, then turn it all the way up as high as it will go and leave it there for at least 30 seconds to a full minute. I don't know if any of you have this machine, but it is the loudest freaking blender I have ever had in my entire life! Which is why I always tried getting it to work on low speed.Anyway, with it running full blast I always have to tightly cover my ears and step away from it. It was horrible to take my hands away from my ears long enough to turn it back down, so I got really good at turning the speed up and down with my foot!My husband suggested I buy some hearing protectors, and at first I was skeptical. I had already tried those foamy ear plugs, and put my good heavy duty 'stereo' headphones on over the plugs thinking that would help, but of course it didn't. Since these hearing protectors look similar to my headphones I thought they would probably be ineffective too. But out of desperation and caving to my husband's insistence, I finally bought these after a couple of hours of research. I didn't want to spend a huge amount of money, but I didn't want to go deaf either.The result? I truly am in shock over how much these helped. Before I even tried them with my Vitamix running, I knew they were going to help tremendously. When I first put them on, I was amazed at the complete and total silence of regular household noises. I took them back off and started tapping my foot on the kitchen floor to see how loud it was, then put them back on while continuing to tap. I could feel the vibration of my tapping, but I could not hear it in the least. Right then and there I made some smoothies so I could test the noise of the Vitamix.  I can still hear my Vitamix running, but I can stand right in front of it with these on and the noise is very low. I can hear myself talk with these on, but it's very far away sounding. I wish my husband would've suggested these a long time ago! They are one of the best things I've purchased in years!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W666Q04YZMSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PW98WO#wasThisHelpful","R1W666Q04YZMSZ","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several sets of earbuds, so I have a lot to compare these with. I judge this type of product mainly by two criteria.....fit and sound.As far as sound goes, they are as good, and maybe slightly better than my favorite buds that I normally use. I say 'slightly' better because it really was hard to tell. But after switching buds back and forth several times during a few different songs, I do think these might sound slightly more 'full'. That being said, the price tag on these is about three times what I paid for any of my other sets. I'm glad I received these for free in exchange for my review. If I had paid $79, I would have returned them.I will say that the wires on these are definitely a bit more substantial than any of my other buds. So I'm guessing that the construction is probably decent. My biggest complaint about these is the fit. These come with four sizes of tips. I tried all four and the only ones I could kindof get to work were the very smallest ones. I even had to kindof hold those in snugly to get the full effect of the sound.As for use with a cell phone, (I always use buds when on my cell) these will not work for that purpose. When talking with these in, they slowly work their way out.If these fit better, I would have rated them higher. As it is, these will basically sit in a drawer and be my 'emergency' ear buds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33B146P57B8W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH0YDY8#wasThisHelpful","R33B146P57B8W3","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sorry I'm not joining in on all the five star reviews here, but according to review guidelines five stars mean ""Love It"", four mean ""Like It"", and three mean ""It's ok"". As classy and well made as this watch is, I have to be honest, and go with the three star ""It's ok"" rating.Maybe I'm just not used to watches this big, but this thing looks absolutely Huge on my wrist. Like a big man's watch! I usually like big bold jewelry, which is why I accepted this watch to review. And I worked several years in a jewelry store, so I'm no stranger to a big 'gold' presence. But as bold and beautiful as it looks in the photo, I felt that in person it was just too much. It's not just the dial that's big, the band is pretty thick & masculine looking too. I had my husband to try it on and although it was about the right size that he'd wear, it is a bit fancy for his tastes.There are a couple of things I do like about the watch; The dial is very easy to read, and it clearly has an elegant, expensive look. The stainless steel core, plated with gold is a combo that is generally safe for those who are allergic to more inexpensive metals. (I mention this based on my jewelry store experience....I personally do not have issues with inexpensive metals.)My one piece of advice to those who are considering buying this, is to make SURE you like a huge manly look on your wrist before buying this. I put a ruler under the face of the watch, and it measures 1 1/2"" across including the gold rim around the dial. So it might be a good idea to cut a circle of paper with a 1 1/2"" diameter and lay it on your wrist before you spring for this one!One final note, most people will not have the correct tools to remove links, so you will need to take it to a jeweler for that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KO7U9TFIB6ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADSGV34#wasThisHelpful","R1KO7U9TFIB6ZB","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without being able to see ingredients, I accepted this cleanser for free in exchange for my honest review.It does cleanse well, although my skin tends to be dry and does feel a bit tight after using this. The tight dry feeling isn't a huge factor though, because after my shower I always follow up with a toner and then a good moisturizer.On less effective cleansers, I sometimes get a bit more residue on my cotton pad when using my toner. I know this product cleans really well though, because my cotton pad is as clean/white as new when toning after this cleanser.If you are mindful of ingredients though, don't be fooled by the advertised ""White Tea & Vitamin E"". This product also has a lot of questionable, not to mention downright bad ingredients in it. My biggies to avoid are the parabens and this has a nice variety of these buggers, including one of my all-time no-no of ingredients, 'propylparaben'.If this was a face cream or lotion, it would've merited only one star. But since it is a product that is on my skin briefly then gets rinsed off, I am generously giving three stars.So here's the bottom line:If you don't care about ingredients and just want something to cleanse well; AND your skin is either normal or oily, then I say go for it. You will probably love this.For those of you who don't care about ingredients but tend to have dry skin.... If you like to cleanse and go, your face may feel a bit tight after using this. If you have dry skin and use a moisturizer after wards, you'll be fine.If you care about ingredients, you should be able to find a lot of healthier alternatives, no matter what skin type you have.Personally, I will keep this in my shower for emergency use. If it ever gets used up (which I doubt), I will not replace it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R321AE3VXJRGPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YWC6#wasThisHelpful","R321AE3VXJRGPI","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works on a variety of doors, and does not damage the surface in any way.The upper portion that goes over the door has a flexible tab-like thing underneath, that catches to keep it snug on narrow doors, and flexes in for use on wider doors. All of the parts that touch the door are made of a really soft rubbery material that grips, gives, and does not leave marks.The hooks are ok, and it's nice that there are two of them. If I had to find a negative, it would be that the round wire part that attaches the hooks to the main door sleeve (see product photo), tends to rotate quite a bit. So I find that I need to regularly rotate the hooks to straighten them, especially after use. I did not take away a star for that, because it doesn't affect the functionality in the least, and it's easy to straighten. It's just the sort of thing that an anal person like myself would point out.All in all, this is a great improvement over the old stiff hooks from way back when. I did receive it in exchange for my honest review, but I would have no problem paying for another one should I find myself in need.

"I've used a lot of Avery printing supplies in the past, and they are all great. These cards are no different. Printing on them is a breeze; text and colors are sharp and vivid using 'card stock' setting and high print quality. Even with standard print quality they look great, maybe just not quite as vivid.As usual, these cards punch out perfectly, leaving no rough or unfinished looking edges. I love being able to design my own professional looking cards and have the option of changing things up a bit whenever I want, rather than ordering  several hundred at a time and being stuck with them forever. Of course, in my business, I do not go through tons and tons of cards, so this is a very fun and cost effective solution for me. For those of you who run through your cards like crazy, ordering from an outside company would probably be more cost effective. But these would still be great for whipping out something a little different once in awhile, or for getting you through in between orders if you happen to run out.All in all, a good product that works great for a great variety of business/marketing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2408RPWMTBM4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XPHB#wasThisHelpful","R2408RPWMTBM4M","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely, positively, love, love, love these cards! I was able to fit so much information on them, including business name, contact info, logo & slogan, and even a price list on the inside. For printing preferences, I chose card stock & high quality, and they turned out beautifully!To create in your cards in Microsoft Word, you will need to download the template if you do not already have it. The Avery product number is '8820', and the template number '5302'. Typing in either number at avery.com will take you to the proper template to download. Or, if you want to use one of their pre-made designs, you can even do it right on the Avery website and print your cards from there. You simply replace their generic info with your own.  All fields are lined up and ready to go, and there are tons of designs to choose from. This is great for those of you who do not have MS Word.I ended up doing something different however....I started with the MS Word template but felt a bit restricted there. Design-wise, I feel I can do so much more in Photoshop, so I made my own template there and filled in the printable areas. They turned out perfectly lined up when printed! If you love the creative freedom you have with Photoshop (or the Elements version) and want to set up your own template in Photoshop, please look at the comments section. Immediately after posting this review I will post the instructions in the comments. That way I won't crown this review with a lot of info that only a few will probably want.Also, I am posting a photo of the cards I created, so you can see how they line up on the sheet. Lined up this way, when you print the front, then turn them over and print the same thing on the back, they will turn out just right. (You will have two card 'fronts' and two card 'back' per sheet.) These are not my final product, I have some tweaking to do. But the pic should give you a good idea how to line up your text in case you opt for the Photoshop instructions.Bottom line, I am extremely happy with these cards.

"I have had this machine for going on a year and a half now, so I have given myself plenty of time to use it before writing my review. I will try to be quick and to the point on the pros and cons I have found, although it's sometimes difficult to be brief on a machine of this caliperPros First:*I absolutely love the large throat space and can easily quilt everything from table runners to lap quilts and wall hangings. I wouldn't try to quilt anything in the full/queen/king size ranges, but that's just me. Others may find it doable.*I also love the smooth, even stitches that this machine produces. I rarely need to play with the thread tension, but when I do it's easy to adjust and I don't have to fight with it! Also, there are plenty of accessories (including quilting foot and 1/4"" foot, of course), and I love that the 1/4"" foot also has markings for 1/4"" from the end of the fabric (so you'll know exactly when to turn the corner for binding,etc).*I'm saving my all-time, absolute favorite feature for last, and that is the simple, lowly, thread cutter. I always thought it'd be handy to have, but turns out it goes way past handy! Quilters will know what I mean when I say it is so awesome to automatically have your top/bottom threads cut whenever you need to start a new line of quilting. Not having to reach under the quilt to clip the bottom thread is heaven! Even when just doing straight line piecing I have found that I love the automatic cutter. Now, when I use my other machine, I really miss that automatic thread cutter!Ok, Cons next:*The bobbin placement is a bit difficult to get used to. My hands are about average sized, and it was hard to get used to maneuvering the bobbin case in from the side. Plus, I really had to crane my head down and sideways to see, which could be uncomfortable for someone like me who has periodic neck issues. I'm not saying you can't do it if you have large hands, but I am saying you may have difficulty, especially at first. All that being said, I am used to it now and can do it easily, so no star deduction for this feature.*Next con is the feed dog/presser foot pressure features. It is very subtle, and oftentimes I cannot even tell that I have made any adjustments. I have to go from one extreme to the other to really notice even a minor difference. I mention this because, my neighbor has a competing machine that is pretty much like this Brother in every way, just more expensive. (Her machine starts with a 'J'). I have tried hers, and the pressure adjustments are much more responsive than mine, so either my machine is just a little whacky, or there is a reason for the price difference. This is the one and only negative feature I subtracted a star for. I really wanted this feature, because as I said I tried it on the competing machine and it worked like a charm. So it was one of the selling points for me. Needless to say, because of this I find free-motion quilting easier on her machine than on mine.Next I will just share a couple of observations that do not fall into Pro or Con categories, and these comments do not affect my star rating:Threading for me, wasn't intuitive compared to other machines I've had and I found myself looking at the instructions pretty often in the beginning. Now I can whip it out pretty fast, unless I haven't used the machine in several weeks.Also, although the speed capability is nice, I find that I personally cannot always use it maxed out. Sometimes my seams get a tiny bit off when I go too fast. The foot pedal is very easy to control tho, so this is really just my issue, not the machines'.My last comment is more of a 'wish' item. If only this machine had even just a couple of decorative stitches it would be a pretty complete package. As it stands now, if I want to incorporate a zig-zag or even a simple 's' curve stitch into my quilting, I have to go back to my little machine with the small throat space. But I knew this was just a straight stitch machine when I bought it, so of course no star deduction on that either.All in all, I love this machine and fully expect to get a lot more use from it. I was actually considering five stars instead of just four, but the pressure adjustment issue was enough to slightly edge my rating down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VFDFLNPDW6S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003C29EL4#wasThisHelpful","R2VFDFLNPDW6S2","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fifth brand of coconut water I've tried, and my favorite so far. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of any coconut water but it is a pretty healthy beverage so I try to drink it periodically. Of all the brands I've tried, the main difference I can taste is in the freshness. Some taste like they've been sitting around awhile...almost spoiled in fact. But at least three of the brands I've tried taste pretty fresh. And of all those, this one tastes the freshest, followed closely by a brand called 'Taste Nirvana'.My husband is the real coconut lover in the family, and he loves coconut water. When he tasted this one, he also said it was his favorite, and he used the word 'fresh' to describe it as well.Although I received this for free in exchange for my honest review, this is the brand I will buy now, as it's the easiest one for me to get down. (and my husband of course, guzzles it!And now, an interesting tidbit....The main reason I ever decided to try coconut water in the first place, was because I saw a health show on tv where a doctor was saying that coconut water is so similar to human blood, that in emergencies they can use it for blood transfusions. (This is a fact that can be verified with online research). It has electrolytes in it that are similar to those in our blood, and it is easily absorbed by the body. For this reason I consider it an especially great drink for recuperation after a workout!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFCEAN2EVSLDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM9HN0#wasThisHelpful","RFCEAN2EVSLDU","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This handy little chopper is a great alternative to a bigger food processor. So far, everything I have tried chops up perfectly. The more you 'pulse' it, or the longer you run it on continual speed, the finer the pieces. And for the most part the pieces are uniform in size. I have chopped carrots, onion, celery, cucumber, and frozen raspberries (for a dessert recipe). The only thing that had a few larger pieces was the carrots, but I chopped a big batch of them, and there were only 3-4 slightly bigger pieces; they were very easy to pick out.The noise isn't too loud, it's quieter than my full size processor. It's not quite as fast as a full size, but the speed difference is negligible. Plus, in the long run it's quicker, because it's a breeze to clean, and I don't have to haul my bigger one in and out of the cabinet all the time now. This is so small I can just leave it on my counter top. I love that you can just chop in the bowl, then put a lid on it for later use.The bowls that come with this are exactly the same size as some pyrex bowls I have, and I can use those with the blades as well. That makes it very handy for chopping up a variety of items and storing them separately for later use.I am very happy with this so far. I have used it almost daily since I received it, and expect to get a lot more use from it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOTUYY88MXZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK13Y#wasThisHelpful","R3AOTUYY88MXZM","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works like a cleanser and toner in one. All you do is put some on a cotton pad and clean your face with it. No rinsing required! I love how easy it is.I have done the same thing with my natural toner when wanting to clean my face in a hurry. This cleansing water works better. It gets dirt/makeup off with less effort.My skin doesn't feel the same afterward as it does with the toner....with this product, I at first had to kindof get used to what I thought was residue. But I started noticing that my skin was not drying out so much throughout the day as it would with regular cleanser and/or toner. So I think what I must be feeling is some sort of humectant that is attracting moisture to my skin.Basically, my toner makes my skin 'feel' cleaner afterward, but my cotton pad feels more gentle with this cleanser and hours afterward my face feels more moist. Sometimes I don't even use lotion now. With my toner, my skin would be bone dry after 15 minutes, even with my toner-then-lotion routine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQ3MH4UYYWNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJ796#wasThisHelpful","R2KQ3MH4UYYWNM","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If not for all the tiny round silver things that fall off, this tissue would've gotten five stars.The paper is all beautiful and it's a great price for the amount you get, but I ended up using just a few sheets and putting the rest away. Some  pieces of the tissue do not have the silver circles attached, but it's hard to get one of those pieces out without loosening some silver from the other pieces.The circles are small, flat, discs just a tad bigger than glitter. I wanted this mostly to put in decorative tins with baked goods. Turns out I couldn't use much of it, because I certainly didn't want that stuff on my goodies! In fact, I don't really want it anywhere at all!So please bear in mind that this rating and review is coming from someone highly opposed to glitter of all kind. (I have thrown away all xmas decorations with glitter, and when I get a card with glitter I slip it into a clear baggie to keep the glitter contained.) Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful, and if you like glitter, you will love this tissue.

"This coffee maker has some nice options. We like the programmable timer so the coffee is ready when we wake up in the morning.Also, there are 4 brewing choices. The first choice is to just use no specific brew setting at all; this will make regular coffee just like any coffee maker not equipped with brew settings. The other three choices are 1. A small pot (2-4 cup brew), 2. Bold coffee, 3. Extra Bold coffee. These three settings slow down brew time to different extents, causing the water to stay in contact with the grinds longer, which allows more flavor to come through.We like a light roast coffee, but we end up using a lot of it because we still like plenty of flavor without the charred taste that medium and dark roast coffees can sometimes have. So we thought we'd try all of the different settings, especially since we only make a 4 cup pot each day. We were hoping we'd be able to use less coffee.Well the 2-4 cup setting, as well as the bold, and extra bold settings all brought out a bitter, burnt, charred characteristic that we didn't like, even when using less coffee. So then we tried the standard setting, with the regular amount of coffee and although it wasn't really charred tasting, it was a bit more bitter than usual. So then we tried using less coffee than normal, and on regular setting, and that's where we found our perfect cup of coffee!So even on the standard setting, you will need less coffee. For those of you who love strong coffee, or for those of you who love a certain brand that rhymes with 'charbucks', the bold and extra bold settings will really bring out that type of flavor, while using less coffee.As for the other features, the thermal carafe is awesome! We drink our coffee pretty quickly so we don't really need that feature, but I always keep hot water on the stove for tea throughout the day. Now I can heat my water on the stove, pour it onto the carafe (or just run plain water through the coffeemaker), and it stays hot for a few hours. Anything that saves electricity, is worth taking advantage of in my book.I hope to get years of use from this coffeemaker. If I have any adverse issues in the near future, I will be sure to make an amendment to my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXKRIV60AIDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I3V0#wasThisHelpful","R2PXKRIV60AIDF","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had these for about a week now, and use them every day to walk my dog. I will never be without them now!The rubber is soft enough to stretch onto my boots, but still sturdy. The cleats work wonders, I now feel very secure on our icy roads. I live in NW Montana and we finally got our winter snow & ice the past several days, so I was glad to be able to use these.Previously I had a different brand. Those were round shaped (a hard rubber circle), that was really difficult to pull onto my boots. And on those, there were only cleats under the ball of the foot, not the heel. They worked, but walking was very awkward...with no cleats under the heels, they were way lower than the ball of the foot where the cleats were. So with those, I was trading slick roads for awkward walking.With the Stabilicers, walking feels completely comfortable. I can't say enough about these....I guess I am just so pleased to find something that works so much better than my old pair. The only advice I have, is to make sure you order a big enough size. I am a female with a shoe size 7 1/2. According to the size chart on the packaging, a ladies shoe size from 5-8 is supposed to order a small. But after reading reviews of this product from other sellers, I decided to order a medium and I'm glad I did! They fit nicely on my winter boots, my hiking boots, and even on my regular shoes. Since this seller does not list sizing (at the time of this review), here are the numbers:Men shoe size 4-7, and women 5-8, Small.Men shoe size 7.5-10 and women 8.5-12, MediumMen shoe size 10.5-13 LargeMen shoe size 13.5-16, X-LargeLike I said though, it'd be a good idea to order up a size, especially if you are in the upper range for your size category. My husband wears a size 12, and we are going to order an extra large for him, even though the chart recommends large. If that does not work out I will post a notation. If there are no amendments, that means it worked out great for him.Bottom line, I absolutely love these, I don't think I could fall if I tried!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4GFVWQTSM59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNKZ8DA#wasThisHelpful","R1M4GFVWQTSM59","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will say right up front, that I do not use dry kibble for my dog's regular diet, I have him on a homemade diet that I prepare myself according to the guidelines of experts such as Dr. Becker, etc. I won't get into the reasons I feed my dog a homemade diet, that is a whole different bandwagon.But my dog is spoiled, and he gets treats for just about every reason known to man. That can get expensive, and it the calories can also add up. So I periodically get a small bag of the highest quality dog food I can find, and give him one piece at a time for his treats.This dog food consists of really tiny pieces of kibble, so for my little Jack Russel it works great for treats. There are a few larger pieces throughout, but even those are small. If you feed kibble for meals and you have a small dog, this will be great.Now for the quality of the food.....First I will list all the good things about the ingredients in this food:*Contains freeze dried lamb (in addition to the standard lamb meal).*Also has freeze dried lamb organ meat.*No gluten, and no grain (this means no corn, wheat, rye, etc).*Has montmorillionite clay (nutrient rich, great for detoxification).*My dog loves it (to be honest, he loves pretty much everything).*Has a lot of natural healthy ingredients, such as pumpkinseeds, blueberries, squash, and green tea.I will add here, that even though this product has no grain or gluten, it does have starch in the form of tapioca. There is really no other way to form the kibble though, some sort of starch is necessary.Now I will list the biggest thing I don't like about the formulation:*It has Ground Flax....I know, many of you are probably thinking, ""wait, isn't flax good?""Well yes, generally flax is awesome, and it's best eaten 'ground' if you want the benefit of the healthy fats and lignans, etc. The problem, is that flax goes rancid very quickly, especially when ground. Sure there are some preservatives that help (vitamin e, etc), but that is not enough to insure that the flax stay fresh. If you doubt what I'm saying, do your own research. I would much rather see coconut oil (a much more stable fat), added to dog foods.Fortunately, this is just a small bag, and the contents fit in my refrigerator. If you decide to feed this to your dog via larger bags, please try to keep it as airtight as possible, and in a spot that is as cool as possible. This will prolong the shelf life. And who knows, maybe there is so little flax, that even if it does go rancid the result is negligible.I don't mean to pick on this food, as I feel it is fairly high quality 'for a kibble'. The thing is, that it's not just this dog food. Just about every dry kibble food I look at has ground flax.And I for one, will never give any dog food a five star rating if it has flax in it. So please take my rating in that context.Bottom line, I think compared to other dry kibbles out there this is amongst the top in quality. And for tiny treats, a small bag like this will last a long time!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBC0DT1RACG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MX19GM2#wasThisHelpful","R2FBC0DT1RACG","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sprayer is so easy to use! Instructions are clear and to the point. My main application is for stain rather than paint. I have used it on the log siding on the sunny side of our house (a small portion of our house where the logs fade quicker), as well as on the floor boards of my porch. This is my first time with a electric sprayer so I can't compare with others of it's type. But compared to the pump sprayer we always used before, this is a dream!It puts out a smooth even spray, no clogging or spotting, and the job goes very quickly....even with the frequent refills required for a larger job. Cleanup is a breeze when all you have to do is throw out the liners! The capacity of the canister is a bit small for larger jobs, but that is not a con in my book, because this is not being marketed as a large capacity sprayer. Plus, this size is so easy to handle and maneuver!I received this item in exchange for my honest review, and I take that responsibility seriously. I do not give out five star reviews just in 'appreciation' of a free product.

"Before buying this, I did a lot of research on the grinder attachments that fit the Kitchenaid mixer, as well as on stand alone grinders. No grinder had 100% great reviews, so I really had to read about all the good and bad for each model. After much deliberation I finally decided that this grinder would be my best bet. I hoped that I would have the same experience as the other 'positive' reviewers, and I was not disappointed!To put it simply, this grinder works perfectly! Although it's may not be as fast as a commercial grinder, it is way faster (and easier) than the old manual hand grinder we used for years. I used this for two large deer that our family harvested this season, and was very happy with the speed. I constantly inspected the venison for grease and metal shavings that others found in various grinders...but there were Zero of these contaminants from this grinder in our meat. I like that the grinder plates and cutting blade are stainless steel. There are no plastic parts that I could see. We cleaned it before we used it, then again after. All parts are very smoothly finished and easy to get clean.I am definitely happy with this purchase and hope to get years of use from it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQJENBJJV6XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVC0LC8#wasThisHelpful","R2RQJENBJJV6XZ","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These wipes are for geared for makeup removal, and they work fairly well for that purpose. They are a good size, and there is a decent amount of wetness to them, although there could be just a tad more moisture in my opinion. For no makeup, or just light makeup, one wipe will effectively clean your face. For full makeup (foundation, eye-shadow, etc), it will definitely take two wipes.My skin tends toward dryness, and these wipes leave my face a bit sticky, as well as somewhat drier than with my regular face cleanser. I find I need an extra bit a moisturizer afterwards. They have a light pleasant scent but do smell a bit like alcohol, even though I could not find the word 'alcohol' in the ingredients. Also, I'm not excited about the propylene glycol in the ingredients; but since these are not an everyday face cleanser for me I can use them one in awhile without worrying about it too much.Basically, although these do not perform as well as water & a good face cleanser, they do serve my purposes....an occasional convenience when needing a face cleaning substitute.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNSPKPKP1ZC03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HD7SCLC#wasThisHelpful","RNSPKPKP1ZC03","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will begin by saying that my rating is based upon the faulty product I received, and if the situation is resolved I will amend my rating. All in all, I think this has potential to be a convenient little unit.First the good.....I absolutely love the size and weight of this little pc. It is lightweight and easy to hold, and the prop works great. You can choose the angle for the prop, and it stays in position securely. Although there is no cd/dvd drive, if you have hard copies of software you can transfer the setup files to a usb and install them that way. I will not be using all my software on this, as it is mainly going to be an on-the-go type unit for me. But so far, the few things I have installed have worked well.As far as setup goes, it was extremely easy. I think even a first time user could do it. Once the 'really quick' setup is complete, everything runs smooth and fast. There was absolutely no time spent on downloading & 'updating' Windows....a new but pleasant experience for me.Now for the bad....The detachable keyboard does not work. The original one didn't work, and the replacement they sent after being on the phone for almost two hours didn't work either. The tech support folks were friendly enough, but they could not get it working, even after manipulating the pc through remote assistance. Based on some of the other reviews, it appears this keyboard malfunction is a recurring issue. So after another 40 minuted on the phone today, they gave me two choices, either send it in for repair, or exchange the whole unit through Amazon. I have already emailed Amazon to see if I can just get a whole new replacement.So basically, I'm giving three stars for now.

"I have used only two other electric toothbrushes before, one was a brain scrambler, and the other was not. Yet the non-brain-scrambler I was using up until this Oral B, cleaned better than the scrambler. I don't think it was slower, it just seemed to be smoother.When I was offered this product in exchange for my honest review, I almost didn't take it because I love my non-scrambler toothbrush so much. But I travel periodically and like to have everything in doubles so I can keep a toiletry bag packed and ready to goI'm glad I did, this toothbrush not only cleans really, really well, it is very smooth like my other favorite electric toothbrush. If some of you don't know what I mean about brain scrambling, it's when the toothbrush is so vibrational that it feels like your brains are shaking around in your head. My older one that did this was a cheaper one, so that's probably something to look out for!As far as the features of this toothbrush go, there are some really great ones. It of course has the two minute timer, as well as a mini 'pulse' timer for each section of your mouth. There are also a variety of modes for deep cleaning, gum care, etc. But my number one, hands down favorite feature is the Pressure Sensor!Let me explain.........To say I tend to use too much pressure is putting it mildly. In fact, I have even gone through periods of vertigo after too vigorous a brushing with my electric toothbrush. We all have little calcium carbonate crystals (otoliths) in our inner ears, and sometimes for reasons 'unknown', they can break loose and travel to our semi-circular canals, wrecking havoc with our balance. I know it's from brushing too vigorously with my electric toothbrush, because the last three times I went through a several day bout of vertigo, it was after a very thorough brushing. When I say thorough, I mean I go through a minimum of 2-3 of the two minute brushing time periods, and I strain to get every crevice of my mouth that has never seen daylight. And I probably press too hard. My last bout of vertigo was a good reminder to say the least. I'll stick with two minutes from now on.But my point is, I can't say enough about the pressure sensor! It repeatedly reminds me that I'm pressing too hard, and I'm finally learning to ease up. If this toothbrush ever gets lost, stolen, broken, or beamed into space by aliens, I will definitely buy a replacement. Immediately!And finally, let me clarify about my brain scrambler...based on my statements you may think it's just me. But believe me, I have had both of my previous electric toothbrushes out side by side, and compared them one right after another. Some are definitely smoother, and some put out some mega brain scrambling vibration!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LP2OTBIVIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8ODHOA#wasThisHelpful","R2LP2OTBIVIP","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for a month long camping trip we took with our dog in October. After getting them and reading the ingredients, I decided they were definitely worthy of human use as well. In fact, the ingredients are better than many of the wipes made for humans.So I ended up using these on those days we couldn't get to a shower, and they worked great! It took 2-3 wipes for each 'bath', but there was no sickening powder smell, no residue, and they cost way less than the expensive bath wipes made for people. I actually felt nice and clean after using these. They are bigger (8""x7"") than most wipes, and also a bit thicker and softer.I feel I no longer need to buy separate human wipes when we go camping. At 100 wipes for around $6.50, it's a no brainer!

"I did not have to pay for these; I received them in exchange for my honest review. The price at the time of this posting, is $17.50. At first I thought this was way too expensive, but that was before I realized that the one pack of five cloths I received was just a portion of what the consumer gets when they actually buy these. When you buy them, you actually get 30 cloths, (6 packs of 5 cloths).My immediate impression after the first use was that they are awesomely fantastic! They are big & thick, they work as advertised, and don't leave a residue or smell. They do not fall apart at all, and they have plenty of wetness to do a whole adult bath, yet they are not dripping wet.My husband and I go on long camping trips (sometimes roughing it), so it's hard to get a shower every day.

"First I will say that I received this item in exchange for my honest review. I have written a lot of reviews for 'freebies', and although most of my ratings are usually favorable, I have found it necessary to give some items lower ratings. This is not one of them!Simply put, this is the perfect mattress pad. I got the queen size, and it fits my bed perfectly. I have a 9"" mattress with a 3"" memory foam on top of that (12"" total). Although this is advertised as being able to fit up to a 22"" thick mattress, and on my bed there is plenty of spare material under the mattress, it still hugs my mattress nice and snugly.The loft is medium cushy....enough to add a bit of comfort, while not being too thick for my washing machine. It did have the unpleasant 'new' smell when I first opened it, but I washed it before it's first use to take care of that. It washed up nicely, it fits great, and is very comfortable to sleep on.Bottom line, I cannot find one negative thing to say about this, and feel very good about giving it a five star rating!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PRHY0YZ7RI7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN72W2S#wasThisHelpful","R2PRHY0YZ7RI7S","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first multi charger I have tried so I don't have anything to compare it to. It works great though, just as I hoped it would. I have two Sansa MP3 players, and two cameras that can charge via usb. With all four plugged in this unit, they charged completely and quickly.It is fairly small (about 4 1/2"" by just over 2""), and I find it easy to slip it in a corner on my desk, or in the corner of my kitchen counter for an unobtrusive way to charge things. I have always charged everything separately before, and never really thought about buying a more efficient contraption like this. But I was offered the item in exchange for my honest review so I thought I'd give it a try. Now just after a couple of uses, I would miss it if I didn't have it. If it suddenly went 'poof', I would for sure fork out the money to buy a replacement! This is a nice item that works as advertised, and I have no problem giving it Five Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWOLOUO43I6MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA0F8E2#wasThisHelpful","RWOLOUO43I6MI","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this brand of silver internally off and on as needed for several years. Actually on their website, they have a stronger one (600 ppm), that is the one I use. And for those who are worried about the 'topical use only' notice on the label...it is true that the FDA requires this on all angstrom silver. If you find angstrom silver in a health food store that does not have this notice, they are simply not complying with regulations.Colloidal silver is not the same thing, it is definitely inferior.You can find lots of info online on angstrom particles vs colloids. One such website gives the following info: 1. It takes 1 million angstroms on a horizontal plain to cross the distance of one micron. 2. A colloid has been found to be a micron or bigger in size.This means that the angstrom silver particles are at least one million times smaller than colloid particles and are easily absorbed by the body. (The website in question was at cilihealthstore.com/home/news/size-matters-angstrom-vs-colloidal/).I always hear about the 'danger' of silver...specifically that it will turn you blue. There was once a guy on tv who turned blue from colloidal silver. He admitted he took large quantities of it regularly for several years. He had no other adverse effects.This product is angstrom silver, not colloidal. Since the particles are smaller, they tend to not get trapped in the tissues.  As I said, I have used this as needed for years with great results. Usually for something like a sore infected tooth, but once I used it successfully on an infected eye. It always works great, and I do not have to worry about it killing off the beneficial bacteria in my digestive system.I have nothing to do with this company, I just didn't want this product to get a bad rap unfairly. If you check my review history, you will see that I have reviewed several supplements and health products from various companies. I have a background in nutrition and managed a health food store for years.Oh, one more thing....I have used this for my dog as well, with great results. My neighbor has a dachshund with a bad toe...he has been on various antibiotics for the past 2-3 years. A couple of months ago, she started putting just a few drops of the angstrom silver in her dogs food. The toe has finally cleared up and her dog is walking normally again.I am a big believer in going natural whenever possible. Angstrom minerals (no matter which one you use), have particles smaller than any cell in your body, and absorption is pretty much guaranteed! I hope this info will shed some light on this product for those who are considering it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR13Q2A3UISAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU7EOEY#wasThisHelpful","RR13Q2A3UISAP","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These shapes are magnetized along all the edges, and it's amazing how many structures you can come up with. I gotta be honest, I thought this set would be nice to keep around the house for when kids came over. But I am a 57 year old gal having a ton of fun it myself! And of course my nieces and nephews have come up with some pretty cool creations as well. It literally keeps them occupied for hours! Also, none of the pieces are big enough for a child to choke on...so it's a very safe toy.The only thing I didn't care for, is that the set did not come with any photos, instructions, or any information about the product whatsoever. But I didn't let that detract from my rating because it's very easy to just jump in and have fun! Plus, this is an item I received in exchange for my honest review so maybe the packaging is different in that situation???In any event, this is a great toy to have around, both for kids and adults who are 'young at heart'!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUAHSNXUXSEUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMVQLJC#wasThisHelpful","RUAHSNXUXSEUH","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to be clear right off the bat....these do not taste like rich, gooey, sugar filled/ hydrogenated fat filled, candy bars. Also, don't expect them to taste anything like the girl scout 'thin mint' cookies.That being said, I personally really like these. The taste is definitely chocolatey, with just a touch of mint. The texture is as some say, a bit chalky. But take it from someone who has managed a health food store and has lots of experience with many different bars.....the taste is better than I expected, especially given that the majority of ingredients are definitely do-able. They are mostly organic, plant based, gluten-free, and non GMO!When I look for a protein bar, I want the following....good ingredients, a decent amount of protein (these have 15 gms per bar), no trans fats, and low sugar (no matter what the source). These bars do have 19 gms of sugar, which is the one and only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 (wish they would've use a bit of stevia).When I am working out hard though, I feel like I can handle the sugar on those days. Bottom line, these are a great protein/energy boost for shortly before or right after a hard workout. They are a bit spendy, but that is to be expected with higher quality ingredients.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULX2Z3RUO55D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZO6E0I#wasThisHelpful","R2ULX2Z3RUO55D","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a product I would pay for. I chose to receive it in exchange for my honest review, and I had high hopes. I have bags beneath my eyes, maybe not the biggest bags on the planet, but big enough that no makeup technique will hide them.The product is supposed to make a difference quickly, after anywhere between a 3-10 minute treatment. I left it on for 10, and it did not make a difference. Absolutely none at all. And it's not like they recommend using it more often for better results....it says to use it before a girl's night out, etc. So there should be at least some improvement right after using it.I generously gave it two stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, the product has pretty natural ingredients which is important to me. It felt good on my skin and did not irritate at all. I mention that because in the past my eyes have become irritated and watery with other products. So for most people I would say this is fairly safe to use, although please keep in mind that anyone can be allergic to anything, no matter how natural.The second thing I liked was ease of use. I know some have had issues with the skimpy instructions, and yes they are minimal. But the process itself is minimal. Just pour one whole vial on the set of two pads, let it soak in, and put them on under your eyes. Maybe the reason I had better luck with the actual procedure is because I separated the pads a bit before pouring the solution on. So I didn't have to work much at getting them apart. It was a bit tricky getting them on smooth, but I just used a q-tip to help maneuver them and work out the few wrinkles that were created.The bottom line though and the reason for my poor rating, is that there was absolutely zero difference in the look of my eyes with this product. The price tag at the time of this review, is $75.00. Based on my experience, there is no way I would ever pay even $5.00 for it. This might work for some. But it definitely doesn't work for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUYLX91ZW1DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKOV3JE#wasThisHelpful","R1DUYLX91ZW1DU","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time trying a version of this particular software, and although there is a bit of a learning curve, it is well worth the time.I have a lot of experience with Photoshop & Photoshop Elements, and have always used those for most of the flyers, trifolds, graphics, etc. I need to do for my business marketing. I periodically would try something more geared to the type of publishing I need....such as MS Publisher, etc. But I found that although those programs had their benefits, nothing could compare to the the results I could get with my Photoshop products. (I use lots of photos in my marketing materials.) Although Photoshop had a few limitations as far as desktop publishing goes, I was able to work around those limitations in order to make use of all it's other advantages.When I was offered the Corel Draw in exchange for my honest review, the first thing I did was look at other reviews. (I don't want something just for the sake of getting a free product.) Long story short, the few reviews that were posted at the time looked promising so I decided to give this a try.I have now used this several times, and have gone through some of the tutorials. I was really glad to see that I can use a lot of layers, rearrange the order of the layers, and adjust the transparency of the layers. Page components are simple to place and move, text is very easy and intuitive, and there are a ton of features that I never knew I could get outside of Photoshop. I think I have found a piece of software that I can actually get a lot of use out of.At this point I am by no means an expert, but I plan to keep using this and learning more about it in the next several weeks. As I stumble upon anything else that is noteworthy, I will be sure to add comments to this review. Since I did get this for free, the big question now is, would I buy it? Knowing what I do now, you bet! It's great to crawl out of my 'Photoshop box' and learn something new that I feel is worthy of my time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RH9LZBC22WLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYYMX4W#wasThisHelpful","R3RH9LZBC22WLR","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing works really well, and there are several things I like about it.1. There is a nonslip grippy thing at the top where it hugs the shower spigot, so it doesn't slip down like my old one did.2. You can't tell from the picture, but in addition to the two larger hook-like projections at the bottom, there are four more smaller ones inbetween. The way they are arranged makes it perfect to hold a razor on two of them.3. On the bottom shelf, the wires are shaped in a way that allows separation of items.4. The shelves are nice and deep... enough to hold fat bottles, yet the shower spigot still clears the unit.5. And last but not least, I love the look of it. The two front sections are made of a bright beautiful textured material that is the most heavenly color of blue I've ever seen.Those are the pros. As for cons, there aren't any in my opinion. I really like this caddy, it is extremely functional not to mention beautiful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAB0KDK5UBPU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF0FNS0#wasThisHelpful","RAB0KDK5UBPU0","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sorry to be negative and I hesitate to even leave a bad review, as the majority of my reviews are positive. This product however is one I will no longer use, hence the one star.Before I start my rant, I will say that yes, I did clean it before the first use as per the included instructions.My biggest gripe, is that this sprays so fine that a big portion of the oil just goes into the air. Every time I spray it, you can see feathery, cloudy stuff floating in the air for a long time afterwards. It looks similar to walking into a room where people are smoking, except it's more confined to about a 3'x3' area around where it was sprayed. So not only is some of the oil wasted, it leaves a very fine mist of oil on other nearby work surfaces. I always scoot away right after spraying and wait till I can no longer see the mist in the air; so I'm not breathing in oil.Plus, it's very inefficient. I have to pump the heck out of it, only to get just a few seconds of spray, and only a small percentage of it goes into the pan.I bought this to replace my last mister, which was a simple sprayer (not the pump type). The old non-pump sprayer worked for a solid two years before breaking, but I have not been able to find another one like it.Bottom line, I have tried this off and on for the last couple of weeks and I just don't like it at all. So today I took the oil that was left in the mister and poured it back into my olive oil bottle. I know many people have given favorable reviews, and it was based on those reviews that I bought this product. I really had high hopes, but unfortunately this sprayer doesn't work well for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZICGM7RJY3QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DSEWV2#wasThisHelpful","RZICGM7RJY3QC","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent wallet and I will probably use it, but quite honestly I was hoping to like it a bit more.The flap that the bills fit in, is pretty tight....you can just barely get unfolded bills in it. If I end up using this wallet I will probably fold my bills just for easier in & out use.In addition to the bill pocket on the inside, there are three credit card slots, and a slot for a driver's license. I was hoping to have a couple more slots, but three is fine in a pinch.Of course from the photo & written description you can see that the outside of the wallet has a change zipper on one side and a cell phone pocket on the other. I have a standard flip phone, and it fits perfectly in the phone pocket. All in all a nice wallet for quick trips where you just need to carry a phone, cash, and a few cards. Keep in mind though that this is Not an rfid wallet, even though it's made by Travelon.If I had to say what I like best about the wallet, it's probably the print on the inside.

"I first tried these a couple of years ago. They work surprisingly well, especially if you take two capsules at a time. I use them on an as need basis. The directions say to take one capsule 3 times daily. I do not take them daily, just during high stress times; I take 2 caps a few times throughout the day and they really do seem to with my stress level. A bottle lasts me a long time that way. Also, I sometimes take one at night along with a melatonin and I sleep better than with just melatonin alone.If you have constant stress, you may want to try taking them as directed (one each dose, but take them every day).I have taken these for a couple of years and am on about my third bottle now.

I have some sandals with pretty good nubs like these, and with those I can do bigger sections of my foot.

"This purse has a lot of great features, security wise (strap can't be cut, locking zippers, rfid, etc). It's also very streamlined, lightweight, and comfortable. The flashlight is surprisingly bright for such a teeny little thing, and you can either detach it, or use it attached to the strap that hangs inside the main body of the purse. The flashlight strap is long enough to give you some freedom with the light, yet it's not so long that it gets buried in your stuff. The same strap also serves as an attachment to hook your keys onto.What I don't like about the purse, is that it is just a bit Too streamlined (flat). There is no specified cell phone pocket, especially for the older flip phone type which I carry, and when all the pockets are filled (I don't carry much), your stuff will somewhat infringe upon the two bigger sections of the purse. Since there are no inside photos at the time of this review, I will describe all the pockets & measurements below:The main body of the purse measures close to 2 1/2"" wide at the bottom when pulled taut. This measurement is divided between the main zippered section, and the front flap pocket (about 1 1/4"" ea). Behind the front flap pocket is a flat slide pocket. (Not very secure, best for things that won't slide out easily). On the back is a flat zippered pocket. Inside the main compartment, are one zippered pocket, three card slots, and one slide in pocket behind the card slots. I find that the pocket behind the credit card slots is the best fit for my cell phone.A pen loop would have been handy, but I can live without one.I am trying to get used to the narrow spaces in this purse, because I really do like it otherwise. To give you an idea what I put in the purse, here is a list of what I carry: A lipstick, a chapstick, a comb, a skinny eyeglass case (for those sunglasses that clip onto regular glasses), gum, a small travel pill box, a few Dentek brush picks, my cell phone, a pen, and a metal RFID wallet. I use a separate wallet because the three card slots are not enough, plus I like to be able to take the wallet out and put it in a jacket pocket for short trips to the store, etc. For bills and change, I use the zippered pocket inside the main purse compartment. If I am going to an appointment where I will be in a waiting room, I can actually fit my kindle in the main compartment as well, but its very tight & makes it hard to get to my wallet and other stuff.If you carry more than what I do, you may want to go with a bigger purse, or use this just for 'minimalist' times. If I could change anything about this purse, I would have added a cell phone pocket inside the front flap section. That way the phone could be kept separate from the other stuff you may want to put in there. As it stands now, I have to use the flat slide pocket (behind the card slots) in the main section. It's a bit bulky and gets slightly in the way.So there you have it. It may sound like I'm doing a bit of complaining, and I don't mean to; I just want to be thorough about what I like and don't like. I just really like to have things organized, at my fingertips, and easy to get to. All in all I really do like this purse, but may look for one that is just slightly bigger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TE6PWDDZ6EL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBSVWUQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TE6PWDDZ6EL3","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are medium sized scissors, great for office use, and for various light to medium weight fabrics. I used these on several papers and fabrics, and they did well except for on heavy denim. On the denim, the blades were sharp enough, but the scissors themselves seemed to flex somewhat. But since I have heavier duty shears for those stiffer type fabrics, I will keep these in my office and happily use them there.I almost took one star away because of the flexing I felt when cutting the denim. But I decided to stick with five stars, because these scissors aren't specifically advertized for thicker fabrics. The description says they will cut through a variety of papers and fabrics, but it does not say that heavy fabrics are included in that 'variety'. Plus, the brand being 'Mead', leads me to expect more of an office experience from them.As far as the feel, the finger holes are very comfortable and slightly cushy. They are ergonomic and I feel no hand strain with them.I have no problem recommending these for everyday office use or light/medium weight fabrics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15O3EX7SOT7NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSEAU4Y#wasThisHelpful","R15O3EX7SOT7NE","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this filter, and I could not think of one bad thing to say about it, hence the five stars. It's a filter. And it fits my Eureka. And it works as expected.As for the scent, I could not detect much, but I did detect it a little. So for those of you who are sensitive to strong smells, I don't think this filter will be a problem. If you expect to be hit over the head with an out-of-this-world-freshness, you won't get that either. It's just a nice, faint, pleasant scent.Before trying this, my vacuum (a couple of years old) had never had it's filter changed, and it was starting to smell a little 'vacuumy' when I ran it. That vacuumy smell of course, disappeared with this filter, and was replaced by the mild scent described above.I received this filter in exchange for my honest review, so I did not pay for it. After checking the prices that are current as of the writing of this review, the cost on this filter is only a buck or two more than the plain Eureka brand, and about a buck less than the 3M brand. Would I pay for it when it's time to change filters again? Of course!  Even though the scent is very mild, I like it better than the plain unscented filter I had before, and to me that is worth paying an extra buck or two.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZN2LEXV6TR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKKI5DO#wasThisHelpful","R2OZN2LEXV6TR2","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me say that I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am generally pleased by most items I try, and am usually able to honestly give favorable reviews. I wish I could have done that for this item.I like timers, I find them handy, and use them for Christmas lights, garden watering, etc. So I am not new to timers. I thought it would be nice to have another one for my candle warmer, which I always turn on then forget to turn off. That's why I decided to give this product a try.When I first opened this package, I thought Wow... this is a small, nice looking, unobtrusive timer. (I am used to bigger ones.)So my first impression was that I thought I was going to love this. I have always been able to easily program all my other timers. Granted, I usually look at the instructions but they have always been easy to follow. Definitely not so with this timer! Maybe all the other timers I've ever used were just very simple, but nonetheless...well, just read on:First: You need to set this up with the correct date, time, latitude, sunrise/sunset times, and daylight savings time option. This portion of the setup alone, consists of ten steps.Second: You need to set up the timer for your event(s). You can have up to seven events, and your events can be either just one day, every day, just weekends, or just weekdays. You can either choose actual on/off times, or have the timer coincide with your sunrise/sunset times (from the first set of steps). You need to go through 14 steps for this, although a couple of the steps may prompt you to skip ahead in certain situations.Third: In order for the event times to actually work, you then need to set the operating mode. This is a three step process, although you need to choose from six options in step one alone. I won't get into the details, but I think it would have been much simpler to choose from either 'On' (using event times), 'Off' (disable timer completely), or 'Random' (using timer, but with 30+- delays to give lived in appearance). Another option that is important, but not included would have been a 'manual' option, to bypass the timer. Instead there a few other options that complicate things unnecessarily.Before I continue, I will mention that you can operate up to two different items with this timer, but both must use the same event times.Ok, after all was said and done, I did finally get this darn thing programmed and plugged in. And it does work...which made me consider giving four stars instead of three. But I didn't because I KNOW I will need to keep the direction sheet folded and placed near the timer. If I ever want to change the programming I will definitely need instructions again.This thing has a lot of options, but to me they are unnecessary ones. I'm surprised something this complicated wasn't set up to run two different devices independently, instead of both having to be on the same time schedule. And I would prefer a manual option (as mentioned above) as well. If there is a mode that works as a manual option, the instructions were definitely not clear about it.Would I ever buy this if I need another timer? Maybe if it was the only one left on the planet, and I had no choice.

"This carpet washer does a very decent job of cleaning the carpet. There are pros and cons, but all in all I feel very good about recommending it.First the pros:1. This has to be by far the easiest thing I have ever put together. I did read directions, just because feel incomplete if I don't. But I would not have needed them at all. The top part of the handle needs pushed down into the main handle, and then three screws need put in the unit. Of the three screws, 1 is longer than the other two. The directions are very clear as to which screws go where, but honestly because of the placement of the holes, you can tell where the matched pair of screw go vs. the single longer screw. Basically, that's it. Put the handle in and put in three screws. It took just a few minutes.2. It's super easy to get the water tanks in and out. The top one is for the cleaning solution, and the bottom one is for collecting the dirty water. When it's time to refill the cleaning solution and dump dirty water, it is very quick and easy.3. This is simple to run, and for the most part it cleans really well (I have medium nap carpet).  For more soiled areas you do need to either pre-treat, or go over it several times with the machine.4. This has double cleaning brushes, which is of course better than just a single brush! On my carpets I still had to make many passes in areas (see cons), but I imagine lightly soiled carpets and/or low nap carpets would be very quick and easy to clean with the double brushes.To summarize the pros, this works as expected for a good 'home' carpet cleaning machine.Now for the cons:1. For areas that are minimally soiled, a couple of passes work very well. But for more soiled areas, I found myself having to go over several times, releasing cleaner, then sucking up water, repeating, etc. (I have a medium nap carpet).2. It does suck up the water fairly well, but not as well as I'm used to from having my carpets professionally cleaned. No matter how many times I went over an area to suck the water back in, it never got to a point where it was dry enough for me. In an ideal situation, when the cleaning solution is empty, the dirty water tank should be close to full because they seem to be about the same size. I would empty the dirty water at the same time I would refill the solution tank, and it seems like about 75% of the water was being sucked back out of the carpet. It might be better with a lower nap carpet.To summarize the cons, it is a bit time consuming to really clean a carpet, and then to get as much water out as possible. A LOT of passes are required, unless you are just touching up a minimally soiled carpet.I would like to emphasize though, that I did not let the cons detract from my rating, because let's face it...this is a home machine, not a commercial one. So I feel it would be unfair to expect it to work like a commercial carpet cleaner. My expectations are high, but not unreasonable.I guess the bottom line, and what made me choose five stars, is that even though this doesn't quite measure up to a professional job (in terms of water extraction and speed), it still does a very good job. I am extremely happy with the way my freshly cleaned carpets look!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CAMQ2PLG8KKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT5IEPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CAMQ2PLG8KKB","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very happy with this computer. But I'll first address my one and only issue, which was set-up time. I was surprised that the computer automatically ran about a 15 minute self diagnostic upon booting, then I was prompted to run a more thorough ""recommended"" diagnostic. The prompt said it could take up to 30 minutes. Since it was recommended, I did it. It took an hour and a half! Then next time I went to start it, it tried going through all that diagnostic stuff again, so I cancelled out of it. Now it starts normally and quickly. I really haven't had a new computer do that before, so I didn't know what to think. But all is well now so I did not let that one small issue detract from my rating.Now for the positive comments....One thing I really like about this computer is that it came with less bloatware (software I don't need), than most new computers I've gotten. I did not have to go through and uninstall a bunch of stuff! It did come with McAfee Antivirus, which I may go ahead and use for awhile.By today's standards, this computer has a somewhat minimal configuration, and has no dvd drive. But that did not alter my rating either, because the price tag is really great. Plus, a really nice separate dvd can be purchased for around $20-$25. In comparison, I have seen lesser computers in this same (or even higher) price range. Just that fact alone made me want to give six stars, but alas, five is the limit. Although I received it in exchange for my honest review, I would have no issue paying what I consider to be an excellent price for it.I also love the all-in-one aspect of this system. Some people may feel that having to keep it plugged in is a pain, but I personally find that to be a non-issue. For me, this is like a desktop without the big heavy tower. And it takes up less space depth wise on my desk than my laptops do. Granted (as mentioned before), the configuration is less beefy than many desktops, or even laptops for that matter, but since the price is minimal as well I feel it is a fair trade-off. And despite the minimal configuration, I have not found any significant speed issues thus far.The other thing I really love is the 19 1/2"" display. It's awesome to have such a big screen, and it really doesn't take up much room at all. It's nice and thin, fairly lightweight (yet sturdy), and it's not at all cumbersome to move around. I also love the keyboard. It is about an inch smaller depth wise, and about 1/2"" shorter lengthwise than my other wireless keyboard, so it is very streamlined. The keys are standard sized and very comfortable to use.I am still fairly new to Windows 8, so I will be using this computer to really learn the ins and outs of that operating system. If I run into any negative issues in the next several months I will be sure to update my review. But so far, so good. I am a happy camper!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REP9PX9N81A27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE80STG#wasThisHelpful","REP9PX9N81A27","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this toothbrush!!!My previous one was a battery operated one (also a Philips) and although it was decent, this one is far superior.This one does not cause a vibration that makes me feel like my brains are being scrambled. My previous one, I would have to hold really lightly against my teeth because of the wicked vibration.And yet this one works better, even though my brains feel nice and tight inside my head while brushing. It feels much gentler, while at the same time I can tell the head is oscillating much faster. But best of all, it cleans extremely well! I have adult braces, and a regular toothbrush just doesn't do the job. This thing makes my teeth feel so slick and smooth, like I just came from a professional cleaning. The brush head is pretty small, but I really like it for getting into small spaces. I have a small mouth anyway, so the small head is a big bonus.So yeah, I am loving this toothbrush! If it conks out or stops working as well down the road, I will be sure to update my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UC0K2678XERC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZHP49K#wasThisHelpful","R1UC0K2678XERC","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All in all, I like this bike rack. I'll address the cons first, then the pros.This is a nice bike rack once its put together. The photo makes the rack look pretty simple, but there are a surprising number of pieces and hardware to assemble. So my first 'slight' con, is the assembly. But...I did not let that affect my rating, because let's face it, a lot of items need assembled nowadays, and very few of them are simple. Plus, once it's together, it's done.My second con, is the weight. This is heavy and cumbersome to maneuver, both during assembly and when inserting in the hitch.My third con is access to the tailgate. For my vehicle, there is no way to open the tailgate with this rack on.As for pros.....Both of our adult size mountain bikes fit really well. They are easy to take on and off the rack, and feel secure when mounted on the rack. Also, the rack does feel very tight and sturdy once you get it bolted into the hitch. So even though the weight of this rack is heavy, I do feel it adds to the sturdiness of it.I feel the pros outweigh the cons for the most part. If there had been a way to access the tailgate with this rack on, I would have given five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRSYHOY1RA7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHR0H1K#wasThisHelpful","R2CRSYHOY1RA7H","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As soon as I took this out of the box I was disappointed. The utensil holder is attached to the drain board, but there are no holes to drain the silverware. There is no way I will use it this way, as I don't want my utensils sitting in water, or even dampness. That is a breeding ground for bacteria! Plus, the way the main part of the tray is shaped, it holds all the water in, there is no feature to sit it on the edge of the counter so it drains into the sink. The drainboard is deep enough to hold a good amount of water, so it's not that I think it will overflow or anything. I just can't get past the sitting water. If you are one of those people who washes dishes, puts them in the drainer, then dries them and puts them away immediately, and then dumps & dries your drainer, well then you might like this product.The only reason I gave this two stars instead of just one, is that the rack (without the drainboard & utensil holder) fits in the larger side of my double sink, so I can envision a use there for small batches of dishes. It will not fit in a standard sized sink though. (I have one of those extra deep sinks that is bigger on one side and smaller on the other side.) If you're wondering how it will fit in your sink, the measurements of the drainer only without the board, is 14 1/2 x 12 3/8.Others have complained about dishes not standing up and glasses falling & breaking, etc. I personally didn't have a problem with that, but I use lightweight Corelle. Plus, I found that plates were more stable facing one direction than the other. For cups and glasses I had no problem at all, they stayed put. But that really doesn't do me any good since I will only be using this as an in-sink drainer. That doesn't leave room for many cups, as they will be unable to fit on the outside slot thingys between the drainer and sink.I received this product in exchange for my honest review, and bottom line I'm glad I didn't pay for it. It's a nice looking little set, but the lack of utensil drain holes, as well as the lack of a way to drain the main board into the sink, are not great features for the way I like to do things.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGJ7215H96GKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPBNGI4#wasThisHelpful","RGJ7215H96GKT","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of my review covers the top two things I look for in a cleaning product.First of all, Scent.... I will pay more for a really fresh, clean scent. When I'm at the store looking for cleaners, I open all the bottles and sniff them to see which one I like the most.  Actually, they don't even have this  particular cleaner at my local store (I live in a tiny town). So I was excited to try it in exchange for my honest review. I knew I loved the scent of Gain laundry detergent, so I hoped this smelled just as great. And it does!Second, Does it clean well? Yes!!! Mainly, I have used this diluted in a spray bottle for bathroom sinks, counters, faucets, and kitchen surfaces as well. (You don't need much to do the job!) I have also used it to mop my floors. In all cases I am very happy with the cleaning power.  Surfaces are squeaky clean, and no filmy residue. And of course I love how clean my house smells too!Now that I've tried it, I'm bummed they don't carry it at my local store. I am going to take the bottle in when it's empty and ask if they can keep it in stock. Bottom line, it works, it smells fantastic, and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11590JQZS5BY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHRK2BQ#wasThisHelpful","R11590JQZS5BY2","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I want to say is this: If your insomnia has NOTHING to do with caffeine consumption, find another product...Maybe straight melatonin, or herbs like Valerian, Hops, & Skullcap. If your mind races with stress or worry at night, then add theanine to the aforementioned products.Ruta Sleep is specifically meant to get rid of the caffeine in your body so that it doesn't keep you awake. It has two active ingredients; Rutaecarpine (the caffeine eliminator), and time release Melatonin (a natural hormone we all produce at night to help us sleep). Of course as we get older, our natural melatonin production decreases greatly. This is why so many of us more mature adults suffer from insomnia, and why melatonin is added to many of the natural sleep aids out there.Ok, on to the meat of the review; does rutaecarpine eliminate the caffeine? Well yes, I think it does. I am not a coffee drinker, but I do drink tea fairly regularly and have to watch the amount I drink. I get the shakes if I drink more than three cups a day. If I take 2 of these capsules in the evening of a 'three cup"" day, then 'shock of all shocks', I actually start getting tired! In fact, I almost get downright sleepy. But if I don't hit the timing just right, then it doesn't work as well. In other words, if I miss my 'tired' window and stay up even a little bit past it, then I can't go to sleep very quickly. But on the other hand, if I get to bed right during that 'tired' sweet spot, I go to sleep within 30 minutes (that's really fast for me). So timing is an issue. I think each person has to go through a little trial and error to find out what works best for them. And for me, once I'm asleep I generally stay asleep pretty well. So even though the melatonin in this is time release, it's not an important factor in my situation. My issue is the initial time it takes to fall asleep, so like I said, the trick is to go to bed during that sweet spot of sleepiness.So yes, I think this product has the potential to work really well for caffeine users. The description is pretty clear about caffeine elimination being an important mechanism of action. But if your insomnia has to do with factors other than caffeine, you may want to try something else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QY3TQPSGLMNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLERZC4#wasThisHelpful","R1QY3TQPSGLMNS","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nifty little gadget. I'm a sucker for organizational containers, and tend to collect so many of them that I have 'clutter' from all my containers. Which defeats the purpose, of course.This awesome little thing though, was actually useful from the first day I received it. It can be used as a round tabletop-desktop container, or it can be 'unfolded' into to a double half moon shaped container that attaches via magnets to a refrigerator, file cabinet, or any other metal surface.Right now, this is in my sewing room on the side of a metal cabinet beside my sewing table. I keep my seam ripper, scissors, and presser-foot screwdriver in it, as well as my chalk pencil and a few other sewing essentials. The magnets are very strong, and so is the material it's made of. The container is very stiff, even though in the picture it looks kind of like one of those soft can coolies. It can really stand up to holding some heavy items.The only problem I have, is that it's not on my refrigerator where it worked really well the first couple of days. I moved it because I decided it'd be even better in my sewing room.So even though I received it in exchange for my honest review, I will be buying two more; one for my refrigerator, and another one for my office. I love anything that organizes without cluttering up my work surface, and this fits the bill!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REY7FC7TP1N1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4613Y4#wasThisHelpful","REY7FC7TP1N1V","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I'll say that I received these plates in exchange for my honest review.Second, I'll say that I accepted these plates in exchange for my review because I have been using them for a few years now and still love them.My local grocery store sells these, along with a few other choices. I have bought the others a few times, but only if the sale is too good to pass up. Most generally, these are the best buy for my money. They are pretty darn sturdy, and hot heavy foods are generally not a problem for these plates. There is a decent sized rounded lip around the plate that really helps hold the food in. Of course if you're going to eat a huge 8"" chunk of lasagna that is 4"" high... well, you might want to double the plate. But your basic piece of chicken, potato salad, and baked beans will work well with just a single plate. The 10+"" size works great for just about everything, especially bigger appetites. I even use this size plate for serving; it works well to hold a plate of cookies, crackers, candies, etc. The medium (8 1/2"") size is perfect for most appetites, and the small (6 3/4"") size is awesome for snacks, desserts, or kid's portions.This particular green/pink design has been around for awhile now, and although function is the main feature I look for, the nice design is a definite plus. (I like pretty things, and these are pretty.)Bottom line, there is no reason to give less than five stars, so five it is!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTPEZIP0AH7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DP5VX5I#wasThisHelpful","RSTPEZIP0AH7Q","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just bought two of these bigger bottles, for the second year in a row. Always before I bought the small bottles just because I love the scent and like to put drops of it in the water kettle on my wood stove. It makes the house smell awesome in the winter. It also works great in an oil burner. or in a steam inhaler.My new favorite use for this though, is for wasp repellant. I am allergic to both wasps and bees, and was reading about natural repellants. I found out last year that eucalyptus oil works wonders. I put in a sprayer that can spray oil type products, and I spray it on all the areas that wasps like to build nests in the spring. (Cheaper spray bottles will cause it to clog, even if you thin it with water). We have a lot of wood on our decks, both in the flooring, railings, and ceilings. There are cracks in the ceiling that make great 'nest' spots, so I also spray it in all the cracks. Last year was the first year we didn't have any wasp nests in those areas. Early on, I do think a small nest was forming because I saw a few going in and out of a specific crack. I got up the next morning while it was still cool and sprayed the heck outta that crack, and a few wasps came stumbling out and died. I didn't see any there after that.Another great time to use this is when you are building a deck, a wood fence, or anything that will need stained. Put some teak oil and eucalyptus oil in with your regular stain, mix it well, and all your wood will naturally smell 'bad' to the wasps! I don't know how long that lasts, but I would think you'd need to re-spray vulnerable areas in subsequent years. And I don't remember the ratio for it, but I'm sure an online search would give you the same info I got.One other thing I do is dab a few drops of this on my clothes and on the bill of my cap. It also keeps the mosquitos away!So bottom line, I will order a couple of these big bottles every year. It may not guarantee that I won't get stung, but it sure raises the odds in my favor!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYNMBC55XVAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DINDGW#wasThisHelpful","R2OYNMBC55XVAK","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have in the past, used two other types of elastic shoelaces. The first type had hardware that went at the bottom of the laces as well as at the top....a bit of unnecessary complication in my opinion. The second type were the simple curly laces that stay put, just by the nature of the curls that stuck out of the top holes. Those were hard to lace and kept needing the curls stretched out during the lacing process, but were 'ok' after I was done....and the laces did not come out of the holes 'very often'.Enter the Ten Seconds Elastic Laces: I had just gotten a new pair of sneakers that came with the old tie up laces, so off I go to the Amazon website to find some more of the curly stretch laces. I happened to see these, and at first the hardware in the photo turned me off because of my experience with the other ones mentioned above. But the more I looked at the photo and read the description, the more worthy they appeared. So I ordered them. And I am extremely happy with them. They laced up very easily and smoothly, they are WAY easier to adjust, there is plenty of string to keep loose enough for my high instep, and the little hardware clip at the top is nice looking and took only about two seconds to feed strings through & adjust. With my shoes on, the shoestrings feel nice and secure, my shoes do not feel at all like they will slip off, yet there is plenty of give so my feet don't feel constricted.Now that I know how much more I like these over all my other stretchy shoestrings, I am going to go back an get the black, grey, and white.

"The first thing I did when I received this flashlight, is try to impatiently rip it out of the packaging. It's in there tight, so when it gave loose it flew across the room and hit the tile floor in my kitchen. I thought ""oh crap"", and tried to turn on. I had to first unscrew it and take the little protective paper out that conserves the batteries. But once I did that, it came on, no problem. So first thing I can say, is that it definitely withstood a pretty hard fall.Next thing I wanted to test out was the light strength/brightness. So I waited till it was dark (I live in a rural Montana area, so dark is DARK!). I took it out on my deck, along with four other flashlights (5 total). On it's highest of the two intensity settings,this flashlight was brighter than all but one. The one that beat it out was a 'Coast PX25', but at the time of this review, that flashlight costs $30.85 compared to $17.90 for this Rayovac.The beam width was about the same in both, but the Coast was noticeably brighter. But then again, the Rayovac was noticeably brighter than the three remaining flashlights I compared it to. All of the flashlights I compared this to, were fairly small handheld ones, averaging 3 1/2"" - 4 1/2"" in length. The Rayovac is slightly larger, at just under 5 1/2"", but the heavy duty rubber protective covering accounts for some of that.Bottom line, I feel this flashlight deserves 5 stars. If the cost was as much as the Coast flashlight, I would've given four stars. But given the reasonable cost, the light quality, and the ""can safely be dropped"" factor, I am very happy with this flashlight. It'll be a great, sturdy light for my husband to throw in his pack for those pre-dawn hikes to his hunting spots next fall!I should note that I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review, so my references to cost are for the benefit of those who would have to pay for this flashlight. If I had to choose between this Rayovac and the brighter Coast light, (and pay for it out of my own pocket), I would choose the Coast for myself and the sturdy Rayovac for my husband.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKZJHOPYO3JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y6DM9W#wasThisHelpful","R2QKZJHOPYO3JO","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is the original review I left. Please also read the comments afterwards, as they give additional info on how this situation played out:Original Review:First of all, let me say I do not normally leave one star reviews. You can easily verify that if you want. Now I'll get into the pros and cons of this computer:Pros: Price is good for the ram, hard drive size, etc. That's it, no more pros.Cons: This is probably just going to be one long rant.....This laptop has not run well from day one. Start up time averages 7 minutes from pushing power button to password login screen. Runs ok after that when offline, but email and internet are slow.I have been on the phone with Toshiba tech support a number of times. They have determined it is a windows software issue, and they will not warranty that. Furthermore,  I cannot restore this computer to factory settings without losing Windows 7. Apparently it originally comes with Windows 8, and is downgraded to Windows 7 prior to being shipped to the consumer. The restore discs that came with the laptop are Windows 8, and tech support said I need to contact Amazon to get a Window 7 restore disc. Plus, if I did decide to restore to factory settings using the Windows 8 discs, I need to change some bios settings first, according to the paperwork that came with the computer.I don't really know if I want Windows 8, I want to use a lot of the software that I already have that works with Windows 7.Edit...Am on the phone wth Amazon customer service right now. Will see how it goes.I can only assume that the factory downgrade from Windows 8 to 7, caused some issues. If the slow startup was normal, and just something that was simply going to happen, I could live with it for the next 5-6 years. But no one seems to be able to tell me if there is something really wrong, that could cause more problems in the future. They can only guess that it's an operating system issue.I have owned only about 4-5 computers in my life. They last me quite awhile and I can usually figure most things out for myself. This particular laptop was a huge waste of $800.00! If anyone else who bought this has had the same issues, please let me know how you handled it. Once the box is opened, it is apparently non-returnable.Edit: Just got off the phone with Amazon, they are sending a replacement. Also, I received an email from Kaspersky support who was also looking into the problem for me. They said there were driver issues at startup.If the replacement laptop works better, I will amend my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4NAUIGUO70P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7PWRSY#wasThisHelpful","R3D4NAUIGUO70P","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little light is pretty handy. It was easy to interpret the mounting procedure and it works for my purposes. I have it under a cabinet that is about 5ft wide, and at the ends of the cabinet are a wall and a refrigerator. Given that the cabinet is in kind of a closed off area, I thought the light would be really birght, as it would be more contained. But it's really kind dim, even on the brightest setting. Also, it's not much of a spreading light.Nonetheless, I really like it and it does the job it was intended for. I have all my dog food, dog treats, supplements, etc in that area. In the morning I like to mix up my dog's breakfast concoction in that space and not have to turn on the big overhead lights. It works perfect for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MAOUC6ZUQ362/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G5CE12#wasThisHelpful","R2MAOUC6ZUQ362","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a quilter, I have used a variety of irons in the past few years. As long as the iron gets good and hot for seam pressing, I'm pretty easy to please. For this iron, there are many pros, & only one con in my opinion:Pros:1. Heats up quickly and gets nice and hot. As another reviewer mentioned, it does have the automatic shut off, but when I'm ready to press a few seams, the first thing I do is reactivate the iron by moving it down then back up again. By the time I get my quilting blocks placed on the ironing board, the iron is once again hot and ready to go.2. I don't use steam much, but of the three irons I currently own, this one has by far the largest steam reservoir. With my last iron, a little plastic container came with it for the purpose of filling the water reservoir. One fill up is all that iron could hold. I used that same cup to put water in this iron, and it looked like it only filled it up about 20%. So I'm guessing this will hold about five times as much water as the other iron. A nice feature, as this iron is just a tad smaller and lighter than the other one.3. The cord is very long (about 12 ft), a great plus in my book.4. The handle extends into a heel type rest for keeping the iron upright. This heel also keeps the cord from getting in the way when ironing.5. Fairly lightweight (therefore good for taking to quilting retreats).6. No annoying beeps!!!!! This may not mean anything to others, but to me it's important. The last iron I got is great except it beeps when you plug it in, it beeps when you turn the dial on, and it beeps when it goes into auto shut-off. Nothing is more distracting than when you're concentrating on tricky seams or applique, then all of a sudden BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP! Fortunately, this T-fal does NOT beep!!!Cons: The only con I noticed is not really a big deal, and one I think I will get used to. The shape & angle of the heel rest makes the iron sit at a more 'slanted back' angle than any other iron I've ever had. Yes, it is very stable, but the angle takes some getting used to when grabbing the handle for picking up or setting down. My wrist isn't flexible enough to maneuver it, I end up having to angle my whole forearm. (I hope that explanation is understandable). I don't have bad wrists or anything, it's just a little awkward.I have a quilting retreat scheduled this Thursday-Sunday, and because of the light weight and long cord, this is the iron I will be taking. I fully expect this to work well during my retreat. If I encounter any negative issues I will update my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKM4EJQV49RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG84YQU#wasThisHelpful","R1YKM4EJQV49RB","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently went on a motion sensor light & motion night light buying spree, which is maybe why I was given the opportunity to receive these particular lights in exchange for my honest review.First of all, I'll say that all of the motion sensor lights I own would probably get a least a four star rating. I'm pretty happy with all of them. With these, I don't even have to decide between 4 or 5 stars, I give 5 without hesitation. I often review things by listing pros and cons. I will do half of that procedure (the pros) with these lights. I won't do cons, because there aren't any in my opinion.Pros:1. Nice and bright, without being blinding.2. Great sensitivity. These turn on exactly when you need them to.3. Great mounting system. There is a hole in the back (adjustable) bracket to use for mounting. It's very easy to slip the hold over your screw or 'larger' nailhead, and then push it down into place. When you need to change batteries (3 size C), you just move the bracket so you can slip it off the screw or nail.I have not used these outside, but I do have another model of Mr Beams light on my outside deck. The batteries in that one have been able to withstand the wicked winter temps we had this past winter, and they are still going strong. So I can only assume that the batteries in this product will fare just as well.Bottom line, I am very happy with these lights. I'm pretty night blind, so I love having lights come on just when I need them to!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7VOKSZJ8J0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HS42LLW#wasThisHelpful","R3S7VOKSZJ8J0J","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third tens unit, and although it's my least favorite of the three I now have, I feel that for the price it's a pretty decent deal. I do like the fact that it is the smallest one I have, so the control unit can very easily fit into pretty much any sized pocket. There is a variety of modes, yet some of them feel so similar to each other that I can barely feel a difference. That is not necessarily a negative though, just an observation. It's still easy to find a mode that feels fairly massage-like.I also prefer a two channel unit, one that has two cords with two pads coming from each cord. It's more clinically effective to have two pads per sore area, so if both trapezius' are sore for example, it's better to have two pads on the right, and two pads on the left. With this unit, you have to go with only one pad on each side, or only do one side with the preferred 'double' pads. Again, this did not affect my star rating, because the price for a good two channel unit is of course, higher.The main reason I gave four stars instead of five, is that from the first time I used this, I felt a sort of hot needle/pinching sensation right beneath the 'snap' part of the pads. If you've used tens before, you'll recognize this as the feeling you get when the pads start to wear. These particular pads were brand new, and seemed to be very moist and plump, just like new pads should look. So I don't know what the issue is. But as I turned up the strength of the signal, only the massage/kneading got stronger, not the pinching feeling.All in all if you want a decent, convenient little tens unit that is easy to use, and is a good price, it'd be worth giving this a try. Keep in mind though, that these are the snap type pads, and not all snap pads are interchangeable. One of my other tens units has the snap pads, but those snap are bigger and won't fit these. Just sayin', be aware of that when you go to buy new pads.One final note, the booklet that came with this is the best and most informative one I have, even considering both of the other units I own were more expensive. It's easy to understand, yet thorough at the same time. Great for a first time tens user!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2XD0OIDBQ26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWLQ3R4#wasThisHelpful","R3P2XD0OIDBQ26","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to try this but it did not meet my expectations. I'll break it down into simple pros and cons, and follow with a summary.Pros:1. It does put out some decent steam for 'short' periods of time.2. There are a many attachments that will allow you to use this just about anywhere and on anything.Cons:1.The steam doesn't last long. The light turns green when it's ready to release full pressure steam. This mode does loosen dirt and stains effectively, but the full pressure mode does not last long At ALL. So you have two choices... keep running it with a tiny amount of ineffective steam (way less than you would get from water boiling in a tea kettle), or you can release the trigger and wait for it to gain full steam power again.2. My second con describes the cumbersome part; It is difficult to hold onto the steamer by the handle, hold down the trigger, and then try and figure out where the third hand is going to come from to push in the button that keeps the trigger engaged (so you don't have to keep holding in in). All this while making sure the cord stays out of the way of the steam. Maybe my hands are too small, but I could not use one of my already engaged hands to activate the button that keeps the trigger pressed, without setting the steamer down on something so that I could free up the hand that was holding onto the handle. I soon figured out that this was all pointless to do anyway. As the full pressure steam runs out quickly, you have to wait & let it build back up, then go through the whole process again. It finally got to where I just kept the trigger engaged until the steam subsided, then released the trigger and set the machine down until the pressure built back up again. Usually the steam pressure lifted before significant hand cramping set in.3. Effectiveness; Given the use/wait/use/wait procedure to run this, it took me 20 minutes to clean just a small portion of my shower walls, and the result was not great. Minor stains and dirt was dissolved, but I still felt mineral build-up. So then I got out some soft scrub and cleaned an equal sized portion of my shower on another area. The soft scrub method did a better job and took about 5 minutes.I'm sorry to be negative.  I am generally pleased with most items and tend to give favorable reviews. Honestly, this item seems more like a 1 or 2 star product for my particular use. The reason I gave 3 stars is because based on other reviews, my issues with the product may not reflect how the majority of users feel. So I did not want to drag down the rating of this product unfairly.I am a woman with periodic neck and shoulder issues and was eager to try something that may make cleaning easier, as prolonged scrubbing can get to me. Maybe a man may find this easier to use. Bottom line, I found this to be no quicker, no more effective, and no easier to use than a cleaning product and elbow grease.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4OEZMHOUT4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G00BTY0#wasThisHelpful","R1L4OEZMHOUT4V","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great tshirt for Big Bang Theory/Star Trek lovers. Looks awesome in person, and there's no doubt that this picture looks exactly like Sheldon.I always put new clothes through the wash before wear them, and this had no fading or degrading of the design whatsoever. (I always turn printed tshirts inside out to wash).As far as sizing goes, this fit just right. I am a 5'7"" female, 125 lbs. I sometimes order a small in tshirts, but since this one said slim fit I ordered a medium. It's slightly looser than the smalls I usually get, but it's a great fit. It is loose enough to be comfortable, but slim enough so that it doesn't look like a sack!

"I always put loads of greens in my morning smoothie, but saw this at my local health food store and was curious enough to try it.I was pleased to see that it is made from Organic kale. It mixes well, and yes, it does taste like kale. The cruciferous taste is even stronger in this powder than it is when using fresh kale, but it doesn't bother me too much. If the taste is off-putting to you, I highly recommend mixing some mint flavored liquid chlorophyll with it. It actually makes this a pleasure to drink that way. (Look for chlorophyll without the parabens....a couple of clean brands include the Sunny Green, as well as Now Foods brand). Just mix the powder with a glass of water, and add a tablespoon of the chlorophyll. Yummy!Basically, if you are a person who does not like to eat your cruciferous vegees, this is a good way to get all those great nutrients. And if you are one of the rare folks who suffer from an Over-active thyroid (most people with thyroid issues are under active), then this is a great alternative to all the popular iodine laden sea vegetables like spirulina, etc. Just remember....over-active, use cruciferous. Under-active, use sea vegetables.Bottom line, I won't use this a lot because I get tons and tons of greens every day. But I was curious, and this will be nice to have in my cupboard just in case. Or it can be a nice refreshing between-meal drink when mixed with the minty liquid chlorophyll.  Another great use will be for camping and road trips....we travel in the boonies where it can be harder to find healthy meals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3M0DNCZZYG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G55LU7Q#wasThisHelpful","R3U3M0DNCZZYG4","A3RFNCMOL3FSE8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFNCMOL3FSE8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a lot of books that were channeled, and a lot of books on reincarnation, karma, etc. This one is refreshingly different, with lots of new insights. No matter what I read, there are usually questions left when I'm done. The information in this book answers many of those questions.Some parts of the book, were kindof ho-hum, and I would think ok, the good parts are over now. Then it would get fascinating again and I would have a hard time tearing myself away. It was back and forth like that throughout the book. I think that's due to the questions that were being asked during the dialog. Some of the questions I guess were just questions that weren't important to me. But boy, when a question came up that sparked my interest I was glued to the pages. Some of the book seemed very basic, and some seemed more advanced. All in all, a great mix. It doesn't tax the brain for too long at a time that way, haha!This is a pretty obscure book that I found by chance, but I'm glad I did.

I saw another offer on Amazon for this exact table for $69 + $8.95 shipping, so this offer, at $42.50 (currently), is a better deal.This is not precision manufacturing, but the bolts screw in nicely and tighten up to provide a solid table.  It's a happy medium between being light enough to easily move or being so sturdy that it's heavy and hard to move.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7290ISTLI2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J8PAPE#wasThisHelpful","R1H7290ISTLI2O","A1F0ITW7KPUKQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F0ITW7KPUKQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased two Smart Solar Solar Stainless Step Light - White LED 3081WRM1 a few years ago and was happy with them.  They eventually failed (as all battery products do) and I ordered replacements.  They didn't work, so I ordered another set. They were also DOA, so I ordered the Kootek® Outdoor Waterproof Solar Lights and they fired right up. Some people have commented about the lack of light provided, but even on a good day, the Smart Solar version produced at best 10% of the light the Kootek®'s do. So, I'm happy with them at this point.

"I've owned TiVo's since 2000 (early adopter). I recently purchased a refurbished TiVo Roamio unit and started it up. One thing I really liked was the ability to transfer season pass info and old programs from the prior TiVo to the new Roamio.  Very slick.  My problem is the remote.  It didn't work like my prior TiVo remotes.  Kept skipping channels, responding incorrectly, etc. I contacted TiVo online and was told the new Roamio remotes were that way. Either that or I was using it incorrectly, or it was programmed incorrectly.  I reprogrammed (connected) it and it still didn't work.  I purchased another new Roamio TiVo remote and it worked fine.  So, I called TiVo and asked how they would handle this.  I was told by Christopher that since I had purchased another TiVo remote they would not do anything for me. I said I could send the new one back for a refund, but he said they wouldn't do that.  So, after 15 years I'll be looking for a new DVR system the next time I need to upgrade.  TiVo has been outstanding for the last 15 years, until this incident.

"We purchased one of the pre-made Bamboo bee houses from Amazon a year ago.  It deteriorated over that time, so we wanted something that would work over a longer period of time.  I purchased a section of white 3 inch PVC pipe at a local hardware store and cut it to length to fit these nest tubes.  A couple of eye hooks were screwed into the PVC so it could be hung from a tree.  We'll have to replace the tubes at some point, but at least the basic structure will stay intact.  This order of 100 tubes filled the 3 inch PVC once, but there was not enough left over to fill it again (or make another one).

"I've been reinsulating my attic and have purchased several tools to use on the batts of insulation. At first I was disappointed with this knife because the reviews were so great and I thought was different than the others.  Then I flipped it over to the serrated edge and it really started doing the job.  Normally you would compress an insulation batt as much as possible to make it easier to cut.  With the serrated edge on this knife I've been able to cut R-30 without compressing it. Also, the serrated edge has been great for cutting out areas for electrical boxes, etc. So far, out of all the insulation cutters I've tried, this is the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38NRD73SOWAAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IQ5HO6#wasThisHelpful","R38NRD73SOWAAM","A1F0ITW7KPUKQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F0ITW7KPUKQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A company I worked for had their own printing department and I used to go there to get some items cut. Two things about this HFS printer remind me of how the printing department cut thick items. First, the clamp on the material you are cutting. Keeping a number of pages, or a book, locked tightly in place is a key part of the process.  Second, this cutter doesn't just drop down, it moves forward creating a slice type of cut, as opposed to just chopping. The printing department cutter also ""sliced"" this way. The cheap paper cutters use the chop method and it's ok for a limited number of pages, but after about 10 or so pages the effectiveness decreases substantially.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RB92M1XWCBQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NO7PYYI#wasThisHelpful","R1RB92M1XWCBQW","A1F0ITW7KPUKQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F0ITW7KPUKQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If these six stories don’t move you there is no hope. Elite Ghosts is the follow up to Elite Metal but can be read standalone (bet you will find yourself going back to read Elite Metal if you haven’t yet). These stories tell the tale of some incredibly brave men and women found in a situation not of their own making and finding the strength to go on and do what is necessary. They aren’t always quiet or pleasant. There is grumping and griping, bitching moaning and groaning but there is also the shock and awe of finding love and a new future.Target: Tungsten by Heather Long – This is a follow up story to Pure Copper by Heather Long from Elite Metal but you don’t have to have read it to get this story but it does contain spoilers if you haven’t. Copper thought she has lost everything when she lost Bradley “Tungsten” Peck and only her determination and her best friend Dr. John “Mercury” Thrace and finding love in the unlikely form of former CIA analyst Gabriel “Brass” Danvers. Now Brad is back from the dead and wants her back. Can she forgive him his deception? What about the new happiness she has found with Gabriel? Can these two strong yet very different men do what is best for this strong yet delicate woman?Zinc's Heart by Rebecca Royce – Zinc is bitter. He lost everything when Operation Phoenix went south. He and Tungsten were wrongfully picked up by the ghosts and forced to play dead for 3 long years. He can’t believe his best friend and brother from another mother, Adam Steele, left him on the field. Now he has to go save Adam’s little sister Sarah who isn’t so little anymore and may be the cure for the breach between Zinc and Steele.Lithium’s Rescue by Sabrina York – A case where the attraction is instant, explosive and potentially deadly or lifesaving. Michelle has information the Ghosts need and Ben “Lithium” Butler has to keep her alive long enough to get the information into the right hands and if his hands wander along the way…Thallium's Submission by Anna Alexander – A sweet and sexy tale of an older woman and a man who yearns to serve. All I could do was sigh.Nickel’s Wounds by Saranna DeWylde – Another strong yet damaged woman and the man who can heal her.

He has lost his sight and his legs. They don’t trust him fully and with reason. The only being he totally trusts is Annie his seeing eye dog and the only other being that can get to him is his nurse who he feels deserves better than him. He feels he isn’t whole. They have been hiding their love for each other from each other for a long time but now it has come out and they have to choose what to do with it. How many sacrifices to the cause will Titanium have to make. I will admit to tears in this story as well.

"Epic fantasy from a master! The nature of submission is a theme that runs through each of Joey W. Hill’s books. In Night's Templar Lord Uthe has submitted to Gods will and the Rule of the Templar Knights. Becoming a Templar Knight saved his sanity and gave him a way to serve while still being a dominant male vampire. While a Knight Uthe was given a duty/quest that he as a vampire was uniquely fitted for. It has been centuries and his mind is failing but it is now time to finish his quest. To aid him in his quest is the most arrogant, sexy and powerful male he can remember meeting, Fae Lord Keldwyn. Kel trips all his buttons making Uthe’s beleaguered mind wonder all the more about the nature of dark and light. Can he trust Kel? Can he trust himself?Night's Templar is a wonderful trip into the world of Lord Uthe. Lord Uthe has been an important secondary character in this series. He has been one of the more reasonable voices on the Vampire Council. A steady companion and advisor to the Queen he stood for Daegan Rei and sired Evan and now we get to peek further into the mind and man behind the deeds. We also get to meet the Fae Lord Keldwyn. Kel is a total dominant and he wants Uthe. When Uthe’s quest requires him to enter the Fae lands Kel uses it to force Uthe to submit to both their desires and labels it payment so Uthe can lie to himself. When feelings go beyond payment and the going gets tough can Uthe truly submit to both Gods and Kel’s will? If m/m or playing with the Knights Templar disturbs you don’t read this book. If you want to read a finely crafted multi layered tale that will leave you wanting to immediately return to this fantastic world this is for you. This book can be read standalone but you will get more out of it if you’ve read the series. This is a book I will reread again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGTK7T78YFJA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0174CBVEU#wasThisHelpful","RGTK7T78YFJA6","A2E1BQDLHYGTNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E1BQDLHYGTNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Long Road Home is a sweet m/m coming home story. Hank was one of Magnum’s victims. Kick out because of his sexuality. Hank has been a lone wolf trucker. Drew has invited him back into the pack but understandably Hank has trust issues. They agree that Hank will haul for them while he gets to know Drew and the pack again. Thom is the human farmer that Hank has to pick up goods from. He never expected to find a mate let alone a human one. Watching these two find each other and deal with their trust issues makes for a sweet if angsty story.I read a lot of ARC’s for review. This was not one of them. When reading an ARC I expect to find some editorial misses. This book was a finished product that I purchased so I was disappointed in the sheer number of editorial flubs in this book. Missing pronouns, choppy sentences and in one instance I had to re-read a paragraph several times to figure out who was speaking and that the character wasn’t talking to himself. I really hated that it interrupted my enjoyment of this story. I love this series and have enjoyed the authors past contribution to this series and Romancing Austin. Still this is a good story and I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJ3EN03R8U5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163BAIGK#wasThisHelpful","R2QJ3EN03R8U5Q","A2E1BQDLHYGTNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E1BQDLHYGTNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These two are stranded together because of a blizzard and the chemistry is instant and combustible. But Trevor is dying and Marcus is going for partner in the firm neither can do long term.

"An exciting, high energy romantic suspense from the fantastic Melissa Schroeder. Get to know the guys and gals of Task Force Hawaii (a mix between 50 and Major Crimes). I love that there are so many strong women in TFH. TFH is headed by former Army Special Forces Officer Martin “Del” Delano. There are those who are just waiting for him to fail. Failing to solve this murder may just be the ammunition they need. Luckily Del has a secret weapon in quirky genius Emma Mitchell who is under contract to assist in cases like this. The chemistry between them is fantastic and if they don’t kill each other they may just be perfect for each other.

"Six amazing stories by six amazing authors. There isn’t a bad one in the bunch.MARION, MISSING by Rachel Caine is a noir detective story with a bit of a ghost tale in it. This takes place during segregated times in America but points out that things haven’t changed as much as we would like. Fantastic story.FEMME FATALE by Cynthia Eden is a more modern day private eye story dealing with the question of how much can you trust a vampire. Fun read.DANCE WITH THE DEVIL by Megan Hart tells what happens when you make a deal with the devil. Not the type of story I usually read but I thoroughly enjoyed it.THE CONSORT by Suzanne Johnson deals with the Faerie. This story deals with an unjust tyranny and how love may just be the strongest power anywhere. A good read.HEART’S BLOOD by Jeffe Kennedy, a Twelve Kingdoms novella can be read stand alone. This story had you rooting for injustices to be righted and the princess to get her guy. A wonderful fairytale.THE DJINN IN THE MIRROR by Mina Khan, a Djinn World novella. This may have been my favorite story in the bunch (not that there were any bad ones). Ashmael the djinn is rightfully pissed about having been betrayed and forced into a mirror for hundreds of years. When the opportunity to become free comes will he grab it? At what cost?These six stories will entertain and make you think and introduce you to some fantastic worlds. I wholly recommend this box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZVJNJNFOHAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147D7JTU#wasThisHelpful","R2LZVJNJNFOHAB","A2E1BQDLHYGTNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E1BQDLHYGTNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two fantastic stories in one book! I feel so lucky that these two fantastic authors got together to create this dark and frightening world where there is so much sadness yet love can grow and shine through.Abandoned by Carrie Ann Ryan – This story is filled with surprises and hope.  I love that bear shifter Anya Tucker is tall. It’s tough being a single mom and change isn’t easy under the best of conditions. These aren’t the best of conditions. Having sexy jaguar tracker, Cole McDermott, close enough that the twins can give him a hard time is giving her fantasies of him giving her something hard in return. But when the twins are stolen Cole may be her only hope for finding them.Unseen by Alexandra Ivy – The Unseen are shifters the SAU are unaware of. They don’t have collars or brands. They are living off the grid and trying to change the plight of the shifters. Wolf shifter Nicole Bradley is hunting down the SAU bastards that shot down her 5 year old son and that hunt takes her across the path of Unseen polar bear shifter Tucker Stone. At serious risk to life, limb and his heart Tucker goes against his nature to help Nicole hunt down the last. Secrets are uncovered and so is Nicole’s heart. Maybe Tucker can give her a reason to go on. That is if they live long enough.If nothing else these stories will leave you with a feeling of hope. That these characters can go through so much and come out of it with hope for the future you can do no less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIZ5DVAHCXVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRXJJ6G#wasThisHelpful","R2NIZ5DVAHCXVE","A2E1BQDLHYGTNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E1BQDLHYGTNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Life has dealt a nasty deal to Faith Armstrong and yet she goes on with a good and caring heart. Life has also dealt a nasty deal to bestselling horror novelist Alec Winston and it is affecting his ability to write. An invitation from his brother to spend the summer in Wilmington Beach might be just the thing to blast through his writer’s block. Faith Armstrong has finally gathered the courage to leave her past behind and accepted a job as a private tutor, hoping for a fresh start on the North Carolina coast. These two damaged individuals just might be perfect for each other.Faith is incredibly strong although she doesn’t appear that way from the outside. But I absolutely fell for her. Alec has grown comfortable wallowing in his pain and misery. When Faith breaks through his gloom he can write again but can she kick start his heart as well? I’ll admit there were times in this book that I hated Alec for striking out in pain at the easiest target, Faith. But when he gets the stick out of his ass he is a pretty good guy.This is the second in the series but can be read stand alone.

"LAST RESORT is a medium-length (81 pages) novella, the most recent work published by KR Griffiths that I picked up for a buck. I have NOT read any of his WILDFIRE CHRONICLES that another reviewer referred to, so perhaps my lukewarm review is because I am missing something.  LAST RESORT is the story of a couple on vacation in a remote Canadian mountain resort, trying one last time to resolve their differences, or perhaps trying to decide whether to call it quits for good or not.  Apparently deciding on the latter, the husband, Shane, decides to pack it in and leaves with his wife Kelly right at the beginning of a monster of a storm.  They don't get too far before deciding that descending the mountain is impossible and returning to their private chalet.Zombie-like mayhem ensues, affecting not only people but animals as well, as Shane and his wife struggle for survival. Not much more to it than that, besides lots of blood and gore. I liked his novels ADRIFT and the sequel, SUNDOWN, much more, as both contained a lot more plot, characterization and mystery than LAST RESORT.

"The DIZA100 is my first iPhone case that has a built-in stand, that will hold the phone upright on a flat surface either in the landscape or portrait orientation.  I think this is a great, albeit simple innovation.  The case is made of some hard polymer and the stand consists of a flap that is held magnetically to the back, but is easily pulled out into a thin and lightweight, but plenty strong enough stand for the phone. The stand fits so seamlessly that I did'[t realize it was there for several weeks, until my son pointed it out.  He has been test driving the case for me.  He is just shy of 15 and hard on iPhones but he has been using it for several months now and so far it has protected the phone well.All the buttons are easily accessible even to those without benefit of fingernails, and the entire case is pretty slim. It extends far enough in front of the front screen so that it affords some protection against scratches and drops, but as others have indicated, this is not a heavy-duty case designed to withstand repeated drops or misuse.  Nor is it intended to be.  I have reviewed several iPhone cases and I think, largely because of the clever stand, and the modest price, this one is the best all around case for normal every day use that I have tried.Recommended.JM Tepperdisclaimer:  I was given this case by the seller in exchange for an honest review.

"LINEAGE was exactly as advertised:a ghost story cum haunted house tale.  It was my first by author Joe Hart but I'll most likely be buying some more.  The writing was detailed and graphic, particularly the first part that tells that story of 10 year old Lance, his mother, and their ultra-sadistic and violent father/husband.  The child and wife beatings are described in bloody detail and are truly horrifying.  Lance barely escapes with his life and psyche intact.  Then the story fast-forwards some 20 odd years to the present where Lance is a successful writer of horror with a girlfriend and life is looking pretty good.  Until he suffers from that most awful bane of writers, a block.  Lance goes of in search of his muse and finds an old, vacant house by a lake in upper Minnesota.  And then the tale begins in earnest.I enjoyed the writing and the pacing.  Some things were predictable (I mean, it is a ghost story after all) but others not, and thing really heat up towards a Grand Guignol ending worthy of Steven Spielberg.  There is no sex but plenty of blood and gore, and enough scary, creepy scenes to make me willing to spend a few more bucks to see what else Mr. Hart has up his sleeve.Recommended.JM Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209K181VDB6WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CL2G9G#wasThisHelpful","R209K181VDB6WL","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Arezio iPhone PU Leather Case is a handsome and relatively inexpensive addition for an iPhone.  Unfortunately, that is the best I can say about it.  It consists of a thin aluminum frame, into which slides the the faux leather backing.  Note the faux.  This is not real leather, although it looks like it.  Despite being a good-looking accessory, especially for a black iPhone, the front of the aluminum holder does not extend far enough in front of the the face of the iPhone to offer any protection against accidental drops.  What is worse, the frame does not have any buttons but only cut-outs for the iPhone controls, so that women with fingernails (especially those who value their nail polish) will have difficulty accessing the controls without using the tips of their nails, which my wife informs me, messes up their nails.So overall, poor quality (not real leather) and poor functionality plus good looks adds up to a 2 in my book.JM Tepperdisclaimer: I was provided the case in exchange for an honest, no-string-attached review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205WZBTN3M77V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161WWOX6#wasThisHelpful","R205WZBTN3M77V","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I KNOW WHO DID IT is the most recent (published June 30, 2015) Jack Nightingale short story.  One could read it as a one-off, but then one would be missing all the fun of the backstory regarding who Jack is, and how he got to be where he is now (in this short story); a London PI, ex-cop, who has (at the time that this story takes place) already had several close encounters of the first kind with black magic and demonology.  If none of that makes any sense, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of NIGHTFALL, the first of 6 major novels and a handful of shorts featuring Jack and company.In I KNOW WHO DID IT, Jack is hired by the surviving sister of a young woman who was found dead of an apparent suicide 40 years earlier at a posh English boarding school.  On his deathbed, the two girls'  comatose father suddenly sits up and screams ""I know who did! it"", prompting the surviving sister to hire Jack to find out what happened in this extremely cold, cold case. Jack being Jack, and Leather being Leather, Jack takes on this seemingly impossible request (he is in between cases, and novels, NIGHTSHADE [#4] and LASTNGHT [#5], at this point) and of course, all hell breaks loose.  Fans of the series will rejoice in seeing Jack back in London with Jenny, the MG and other old friends.Leather is clearly not done with Jack, and is as comfortable writing Nightingale short stories as he is with the full novels.  I'm waiting for novel #7 in the series, but while you're busy with Spider Shepherd Mr. Leather, perhaps you'll throw us Jack fans a bone with a Jack Nightingale novella, set back in London with Jenny, Marlboros, bacon sandwiches, a cranky MG and Robbie Hoyle.  I think there's more to the Robbie story than we know at present.Highly recommended (both for fans and for tyros as well).JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ855HGHXFYYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PU60N0#wasThisHelpful","RQ855HGHXFYYM","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is much easier to write a review of THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS than it is to assign it a numerical ranking.  This is because several of the short stories in this anthology have already been released, not only in whatever periodicals they may have appeared in, but also as Kindle singles, and three of them (MILE 81, UR, and DRUNKEN FIREWORKS) are (arguably, I suppose) among the best of the lot. Another couple of the stories (BLOCKADE BILLY [truly forgettable] and MORALITY,were previously released  (2010)  in an inexpensive hardcover print and/or other editions, and one, DRUNKEN FIREWORKS, a typically wonderful, straight-up no horror or supernatural rural SK tale was released last year as in audible only format) and another, THE LITTLE GREEN GOD OF AGONY, a great King horror short, was published in a 2011 anthology by several horror writers (A BOOK OF HORRORS(.  That leaves 13 other entries, two of which were poems.  Of the remaining 11 (and I am pretty sure that most of them were also previously published in periodicals and possibly other multi-author anthologies that I have not seen), my favorite was OBITS (that reminded me a lot of, and used the same Maguffin as in KIng's THE WORD PROCESSOR).If you have never read any of these stories before, then MILE 81, UR, LITTLE GREEN GOD OF AGONY and DRUNKEN FIREWORKS alone are, I am confident to say, worth the price of admission, and this anthology deserves an Amazon rating of 4 or 5.  But if you have already read only 2 or 3 of them, as most die hard SK fans like myself have, then the rating drops markedly, based only on what's left after all the winners have been discounted.  I have rated this a 3, which, except for BLOCKADE BILLY that I rated as a 2 (my lowest rating for any SK novel, short story, anthology or non-fiction and I have read most of them), which ties for the lowest rating I have given to any review of anything King has published.I am NOT one of those who say stuff like ""Back when he could write..."" or ""His best days are far behind him."" or any horse feces like that.  All one has to do is read  11/22/63, JOYLAND, DOCTOR SLEEP, REVIVAL or either of the two BILL HODGES TRILOGY, all published in 2011 or subsequently, to know that King is still one the best writers of fiction around.  And, it could even be argued, that he is a better writer now, more polished at his craft and more mature, than he he was as an (alcoholic, coked-up but who cares, it was the 70s and 80s and he already had money and accolades enough for a lifetime)  astoundingly successful young writer in his prime, from the mid 1980s through his near-fatal accident in 1999.And for God's sake, those who rate this anthology poorly (as I guess I sort of do) , but say it's because he is writing for money -  that really makes me lol.  The guy is worth something like $400 million.  If YOU had $400 million, would you want to risk your reputation simply to make another lousy  $20 million?  Neither would I, and neither, I am sure, would Stephen King.I think what happened with BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS was, in part, due to the advent of electronic publishing in the form or Kindle singles that allowed him to publish gems like MILE 81, UR (a really great novella), and DRUNKEN FIREWORKS as e-book singles, rather than holding them back for 10 years or so until he had accumulated enough for another anthology that might have been comparable to NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES, EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL, JUST AFTER SUNSET or some of his others.So, in summary, if you've not read any of the stories in this anthology before, I would give it a solid 4 stars.  But given what is left over after removing from consideration those stories that most of his ""Constant Readers"" like me have already bought and read, and going solely on the remaining short stories, I am sad to say that I think a 3 star rating might be generous.JM Tepper","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DIRVH6E3DLDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI1AG#wasThisHelpful","R3DIRVH6E3DLDN","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CURSED is the latest Jack Nightingale short story that I read.  I am a huge fan of Stephen Leather's series of 6 Jack Nightingale novels and it was not until I finished them that I found out that there were a number of short stories.  As far as I can tell, CURSED was Jack's first appearance in print, with this late 2011 short story preceding publication of the first Jack Nightingale novel, NIGHTFALLL,  by almost half a year.  Nevertheless several of the characters who have become mainstays of the novels are here and in fine form:  Wiccan and Black Magic advisor Mrs. Steadman, Jenny, Robbie Hoyle and Superintendent Chalmers all put in appearances.  Regarding the time line of the novels and short stories, Jack would say ""It's complicated"".  Regardless of publication date according to Amazon, CURSED  has to to take place somewhere well after NIGHTFALL, because Jack has already become something of an adept at the Black Arts.In this 60 page short story, Superintendent Chalmers calls on frenemy Jack (a former cop himself - see NIGHTFALL) to help one of his policemen who suffers from some sort of undiagnosable skin illness after attempting to evict a group of gypsies from camping illegally on private land.  Jack investigates and finds evidence that the man has been cursed by an old gypsy woman, and goes about trying to help in his own inimitable fashion.  The writing, plotting and pacing are all near-perfect as they are for just about all the Stephen Leather Jack Nightingale novels and shortsHighly recommended.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KF4K2LOJ0A6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRVAMSE#wasThisHelpful","R3KF4K2LOJ0A6T","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BOOK OF THE DEAD is OK. Well, perhaps a little better than OK, but not good enough for 4 stars.  For me 3 stars means I liked it, but I have to admit that BOOK OF THE DEAD was my least favorite of everything that Beck has written so far. Nothing wrong with our hero, Matt Kearns, who was featured in the first two and the second most recent Alex Hunter novels, and who was the main character in the outstanding 5 star THE FIRST BIRD trilogy. He is likable, fallible and very smart without being a superman like Alex Hunter, ""the Arcadian"" (if you don't know what I'm talking about, check out Beck's bibliography and start with BENEATH THE DARK ICE. Anyway, I digress. All of Beck's previous fiction has been sci-fi, mostly biologically based in some way or another. And it's all terrific. Here he veers off into (for him) the uncharted territory of horror. Not only that, he uses (with all due credit, dedication and a long afterword) the most famous creation of H.P. Lovecraft, the ""Cthulhu Mythos"" and simply takes it into the 21st century.The writing is as crisp as always, and the pacing is great as usual, but I don't think horror, especially Lovecraft's brand and especially the Cthulhu Mythology is Beck's forte. Great writers like Beck and Lovecraft have their own style and Beck just does not seem up to the ""purple prose"" that Lovecraft was so expert at. The novel just isn't creepy enough. It doesn't bring up the feeling of dread and impending doom that Lovecraft was so good at.Furthermore, the worldwide sinkholes that start the whole thing off, and the monstrous things that emerge from them are really, really, really close to what F. Paul Wilson wrote in NIGHTWORLD, the epic conclusion to his legendary ADVERSARY CYCLE, except that Wilson did it better and scarier in 1992. I am not accusing Beck of plagiarism, but as a writer of sci-fi/horror, it would be very surprising to me to think that he had not read FP Wilson's classic and however inadvertently, been influenced by it, even if subconsciously. (remember George Harrison and his My Sweet Lord/ the Chiffons' He's So Fine?).I'm still glad that I read it, but I think that Charlies Stross does a better job with a modernization of Lovecraftian themes in his LAUNDRY SERIES. I'm still a Greig Beck fan, and I'll still be there for the next novel, but this one is just not one of his best.JM Tepper","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TSTVMOM4F38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=176008249X#wasThisHelpful","R30TSTVMOM4F38","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack Nightingale is my favorite Stephen Leather creation.  I've read and loved all 6 novels (although the most recent one, SAN FRANCISCO NIGHTS was the weakest of them all and a tad disappointing) and some of the Jack short stories.  This one, MY NAME IS LYDIA, is a perfect micro version of a typical Jack Nightingale novel.  Jack is called in by a family friend of Jenny's (his girl Friday) to help with her friend's 11 year old daughter, Christine, who has started behaving oddly.  Jack susses out the situation pretty quickly and then has to figure out what to do about it.  To say more risks unnecessary spoilers.

"KRAKEN RISING is the 6th Alex Hunter novel, and I read all of them shortly after they were published.  All star Alex Hunter, a special forces soldier that, after being shot in the head and near death, underwent an experimental procedure that not only restored him to full functioning but made him something of a super-soldier with enhanced strength, speed, endurance and near psychic abilities.  The first 4 Alex Hunter novels were great, the 5th and the novella HAMMER OF GOD (Alex Hunter 5.5) were OK, but not as tight or well done as the first 4.  KRAKEN RISING is a welcome return to form that takes Alex and his team of HAWCs back to Antartica, the location of his first novel (BENEATH THE DARK ICE), to find an experimental sub that disappeared without a trace several years before, but that now is sending out a distress signal.  The mission has great urgency since there is a Chinese destroyer in the area and intel reports that the Chinese have also heard the beacon and are mounting a mission to retrieve the sub that contains highly sensitive tech. Hunter knows what awaits him and the Chinese team because the sub's beacon is coming from precisely the same place that Hunter and colleagues first encountered the titular Kraken years before, barely escaping with their lives.You might think that this sequel to BENEATH THE DARK ICE is a tired retread but you would be wrong.  As with the last Hunter novel (GORGON), the big surprise is not what he is going to find since the monster is named in the title of both, but instead the circumstances.  There is further character development for Alex, Aimee and Joshua that is welcome, since the latter have sort of been in limbo for the past few books.  The adventures below the ice and rock are described in a typical (for Beck) taut, fast-paced manner,  and the Kraken is just as scary as the first time.  But this time around Alex had more to deal with than just the Kraken, although the highly intelligent giant cephalopod would be enough on its own.  But this time there is a psychotic Chinese commander and team to deal with as well as some other, new dangers.  Not to mention the fact that both US and Chinese Navies are massing forces in the Souther Sea above, on the brink of starting WWIII over the missing sub and what the Chinese falsely believe is an American attack on their Antarctic base.Alex and his team (Casey Franks, Sam Reid, Rhino and others) seem much more human and much less all powerful this time around and that makes the story much more interesting.  I think this is probably the best Ale Hunter novel since THIS GREEN HELL, and I am looking forward to the next one, that I suspect may feature Joshua, Alex and Aimee's son in a more prominent role.Recommended.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D9ABFK55R5RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MQQYCI#wasThisHelpful","R1D9ABFK55R5RB","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"14 is the second book I read by Peter Clines.  The first was THE FOLD, which I found accidentally, while browsing other titles. Immediately after finishing THE FOLD, which, obviously, I thought was great,I ordered 14.  214 was written some three years prior to THE FOLD, so in most cases, I would assume that had I known about both, I would have read 14 first and then THE FOLD.  Turns out that would have been a mistake, because the two novels take place in the same universe. Although all the characters in the two are different (except one who died 120 years ago), each is unquestionably linked.  THE FOLD is a sequel (or perhaps a prequel) to 14.  But if you read 14 first, as soon as the name of the 120 year old dead character appears in THE FOLD (fairly early on), you know a big piece, perhaps the most important piece of the mystery of what's going on.  Not so in the reverse direction where in 14 the name does not come up until much later, after a great and most interesting setup.  Assuming that you have not read either novel yet, the above paragraph will likely seem confusing, but it is the best I could do without giving away too much of the plot.I am surprised that none of the other reviews that I have read have commented on the sequel-prequel nature of the two novels, since it is so clear.  I have seen 14 described as a ""Lost""-like story but I cannot see how that is true except on the most superficial of levels.  14 is a completely original and fascinating story.  There are several twists (fewer if you have already read THE FOLD which is why I suggested reading 14 first) in this fast-paced novel.  The writing is excellent and the ensemble cast of mostly 20- and 30-something Los Angelenos, plus an older guy in his late 50s is very well fleshed out.  Our ""hero"", Nate, (although many of the other characters play very key roles), is sort of adrift in LA, working as an hourly temp for over a year at $9.25/hour when he gets a lead on an unbelievable inexpensive apartment in the Kavach building.  It's almost too good to be true (you know what people say about thing that seem too good to be true) so he moves in.  Nate meets neighbors and starts to notice some very odd things about the Kavach, in which each apartment is of different size and layout. Turns out that some of his new friends have noticed odds things as well and it is when this group decides to investigate that things become stranger and stranger.  I read the whole thing in two sittings, as by the 25% mark, I found it almost impossible to put down.This review is deliberately vague so as to not spoil anything for this excellent novel by an author, apparently previously known for a series of Zombie novels (not really my thing but I'm probably going to try them since both 14 and THE FOLD were so good).

THE FOLD had everything I look for in science fiction novels: a premise based on solid science, interesting characters, good writing, an interesting plot and a fast pace. The main plot device involves Mike, a man with an eidetic memory, that is called upon by a friend in the DOD to investigate what is going on in a secret government funded laboratory that claims to have cracked the secret to instantaneous teleportation. Although Mike is not a field agent or even a physicist (he is, by choice, a High School Literature teacher), his eidetic memory and accompanying pattern matching ability makes him his DOD buddy's first choice to investigate the project and report back on whether or not everything is on the up and up, since although the tests so far have been spectacular, there is the general feeling that something is not quite right.Mike shows up, and is immediately shown a successful test of the ""Albuquerque Gate"", involving one of of the staff scientists, and the game is on. There are some twists and turns, a little romance, some military mayhem and more between the beginning and the extremely fast-paced last 20% of the novel. Fans of Hugh Everett's ideas about the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics will like this one, as will many hard sci-fi aficionados. This is a novel written by and for adults, and contains one or two extremely tame sex scenes and a whole lotta F-bombs. It pains me to have to add that last sentence but I am tired of seeing novels savaged by gentle folk for whom sex and the F-word mean that a novel ought to be rated X and/or banned or burned.I am now a fan of Clines and can't wait to read 14 and his other, previously published novels.Highly Recommended.JMT Tepper10/2/15 -addendum after reading Clines' 14.  Read THE FOLD first.  The two novels are sequels/prequels/sidequels of each other.  Knowing what I know now, I am glad that I read THE FOLD first, otherwise much of the latter part of that novel would have been completely predictable after reading 14.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ZQ3HF2A6RDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NDTS7NC#wasThisHelpful","R9ZQ3HF2A6RDZ","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HAMMER OF GOD is novella, approximately 115 pages long, that is subtitled ALEX HUNTER 5.5 to indicate that it takes place in between the GORGON, the 5th Alex Hunter novel and KRAKEN RISING, the newly released 6th full novel in the series.  Im glad that I read HAMMER OF GOD, but unfortunately it was only OK.  Unlike the first 4 Alex Hunter novels, and the spectacular FIRST BIRD trilogy starring Matthew Kearns, each of which was very well written and researched, HAMMER OF GOD had a little bit of a ""phoned in"" feel to it.  The writing was much sloppier than is usually the case with Beck, and there were more than a few typos and other errors.  The character development that has been at least decent in the previous Arcadian novels was non-existent, and although Alex was accompanied by several very familiar characters from earlier novels in the series (Jack Hammerson, Adira Senesh and Sam Reid, there was no additional character development and all the characters, including Alex, were paper thin.The plot was fairly interesting - one thing that Beck never fails to deliver is an interesting plot - and was more than adequate for a novella format.  The ""monsters"" were an original take on the Jewish mystical Golem, the well known story of which was recounted rather briefly and not altogether correctly.Similar to GORGON, which was I thought was slightly better than  HAMMER OF GOD, these last two Beck Alex Hunter offerings did not captivate me the way the previous 4 novels did, in terms of writing, character development or story telling.  This of course did not stop me from preordering Alex Hunter 6, KRAKEN RISING, which I am now reading and which seem so far to be something of a welcome return to form.JM Tepper","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGAU6VDU1JM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MQQYFK#wasThisHelpful","RGAU6VDU1JM5","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this on Showtime tonight while looking for something to watch after the Mets beat the Cubs.  I liked the blurb and started watching at 10:30. I wasn't expecting a masterwork but was pleasantly surprised. The plot, acting and FX were way beyond expectations for  a ”free""  ""B"" movie.It is pretty much a standard werewolf movie, with the unexpected bonus of excellent makeup instead of CGI special effects. The addition of John McHattie to the cast in a major supporting role didn't hurt, and the unknowns in the starring roles were much more than adequate.

"PRINCIPLES OF NEUROBIOLOGY is brand new neuroscience text book aimed at the upper division undergraduate neuroscience major or the first year neuroscience graduate student.  It is exceptional in its organization that, as sole author Liqun Luo states in the preface, "",,, intentionally breaks from the traditional division of neuroscience into molecular, cellular, systems and developmental sections. Instead, most chapters integrate these approaches.""  It is wonderfully successful at this.  In addition, the single author approach results in a uniform style and even depth of coverage. The 13 chapters are carefully organized and sequenced so that the book can be used, as written from beginning to end as a one or two semester course that covers a huge amount of material, from 19th century psychophysics to the newest state of the art in molecular neurobiology.The figures are beautifully done and well-chosen. The experiments illustrated range from redrawings of classical experiments from the middle the 20 century to state-of-the-art  neuronal molecular and cell biology and optogenetics.  The visual system is especially well done, but so are the sections on the other senses and motor systems.  Regulatory systems are covered, including sexual behavior.  Learning and memory and development and evolution of the mammalian central nervous system are here, as well as a chapter on neuropsychiatry disorders.  The text closes with a welcome and badly needed chapter on techniques, something that is overlooked in most of the other general neuroscience texts that I have read.This text covers general introductory neuroscience from A-Z.  I should note that by ""neuroscience"", I mean principally the structure and function of mammalian neurons and the central nervous system. While there are behavioral experiments described throughout the text, this is definitely a neurobiology-based approach to neuroscience as the title suggests.  It does not venture into cognitive neuroscience, something that is better left to a more specialized text.  There is also relatively little pharmacology or neurochemistry per se.PRINCIPLES OF NEUROBIOLOGY is, in my opinion, the best single textbook for teaching a comprehensive survey of modern neuroscience.  The author is to be congratulated on this fine effort.  We will be adopting this book next fall for our first year graduate course, ""Foundations of Neuroscience"".Highly recommended.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHV0LSLS994G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081534533X#wasThisHelpful","R2CHV0LSLS994G","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SUNDOWN is the second book in at least a trilogy that started with ADRIFT. When I started ADRIFT, there was no clue in the Amazon page or book blurb that it was not a single standalone novel. There were many plot holes in ADRIFT, and it was pretty clear that the end was not the end. I forgot about it and so am late to the party with SUNDOWN (ADRIFT2:SUNDOWN).The same things that I liked about ADRIFT are also present in SUNDOWN. Great plot, very original and scary take on vampires (STILL not fully explained) and fast-paced, hard-to-put-down prose. Two of the characters from ADRIFT return, one, Herb, the scion of an ancient family tasked with keeping a truce with the vampires and the other, Dan, the unlikely (and presumably only) possessor of the same psychic power as the vampires and thus the only one who can actually fight them face to face.I am not a great fan of never ending novels, or even trilogies that could have been written and released as one long novel. This seems to be the way that most indie writers are going these days (But not my new fave, Ike Hamill - check him out for great horror) so I can either give up in the indies or get used to it. For now, I'll go along. We have moved from the giant, new cruise ship, the Oceanus, that was destroyed in ADRIFT to central London and the Shard, a (real) high rise for millionaires, where most of the action takes place. We learn a bit more about the vampires (only a bit) and the ancient families that have vowed to protect them and feed them occasionally. This has now failed disastrously in the UK, and the vamps have got their talons and teeth in a giant uproar called a ""Rising"".There has to be at least one more (i'm betting more) to finally explain everything and either end humanity or the vamps. I'll spring for the couple of bucks for it because now I'm really curious to get the whole story.Recommended (but beware that this is part 2 - you have to read ADRIFT first - and there is no guarantee that it will end with the next one).JM Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387XA296R3VMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013MZCKOI#wasThisHelpful","R387XA296R3VMN","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cutting mechanism is exactly as advertised: very sharp.  And the file is also sharp and effective. However, The plastic housing covering the clippers is far too large.  It gets in the way so that it's tough to get the clippers themselves into the correct position. It's also hard to see exactly where in the nail you are going to cut. Finally, there is no little metal thingy that folds out to help clean under the nails or around the cuticles. I miss that a lot.

"For the second time in a row, Hamill has ventured very far from his comfort zone.  Fans may be dismayed to find a second consecutive novel with no horror or supernatural tropes, but never fear, WILD FYRE is an exciting, hard to put down thriller nonetheless.  This time around we are in the realm of science fiction, or perhaps more specifically, cyberfiction. No aliens, time travel or quantum mechanics, just good old fashioned AI with all its trappings.WILD FYRE opens with narration by Ed, the default leader of a group of 10 smart and creative but otherwise normal guys who have habit of not lasting too long at a job. They are just too creative and easily bored.  Ed's special talent is to find the perfect job for anyone. Something that they will excel at, even if it is not exactly what they think they are good at.  As it happens, Ed has spent most of his career finding jobs for this group of ten friends, with a long string of happy employers and employees.  Several of the group happen to be computer geeks of one sort or another. So much of the technobabble here is about servers and coding and hacking.  In fact, the chapter/section headers are formatted like the start of bits of C code and the names themselves like C OR Pascal function calls.  But one need not know a thing about any of this stuff to fully enjoy the novel, and the tech takes a back seat to the character-based story of what happens when one of the group, Jim, sets out to write some code that will simplify his life by predicting ahead of time when to turn on the lights, start the coffee and so on.  Jim is killed on the first page, and the rest of the novel concerns the how and why.Hamill shows off once again his consistent skill at creating (mostly) very likable and human characters that you would like to be friends with.  We learn about them through conversation and dialogue, which are both also especially strong points of his writing.  The ten meet on a regular basis for lunch and the conversations are fascinating. The technospeak has perfect verisimilitude (Hamill apparently used to be a programmer or systems analyst) which is fun for old coders like me to read but which will not interfere with enjoyment by folks who don't know a nybble from a byte.And finally, unlike so so many indie authors, WILD FYRE and Hamill's other novels are all (with one exception - and that a single sequel) totally self-contained, one off novels.  One can start WILD FYRE (or any of his others) without fear that one is signing on to a multi-book, (almost) never-ending saga.  The end is the end.Recommended.JM  Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HGIX5Z5MY15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QSUBC2#wasThisHelpful","R21HGIX5Z5MY15","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been on an Ike Hamill binge since I first discovered him via a review request several months ago.  For I guy I never heard of, he turned out to be this incredibly prolific writer who wrote stuff that was right up my alley. A little supernatural, a little magic, a little sci-fi, some graphic horror, and excellent plotting and pacing.  Believable dialogue and characters that did not act as if they had been struck down by the stupid and banal virus.So when I saw that PUNCH LIST had just been released, I grabbed it and moved it to the head of my queue.  It is a very quick read, and totally ambushed me.  Every thing that I liked about Ike Hamill's writing was on display, except for the fantasy, magic, sci-fi, and graphic horror.  This is a totally different kind of read.  It is principally a coming of age story of 17 year old Jeff Vickers, during the summer between his junior and senior years in High School.  Jeff is a good kid, a bit on the shy side.  Early on his oldest friend and close neighbor, Angie (10 days older and best buddies forever) introduces Jeff to a clique of new friends.  They are all great guys plus Angie.  Their characters are much better developed than the usual supporting cast, and added greatly to the storyline.  They are all ""good"" kids.  They do well in school, one plays football but is smart, gentle and kind (Vick), one is openly gay (Danny) and imagines himself an actor and is accepted by all, one (Adam) is younger brother and colleague to a science guy and so on.  They hang out in Adam's basement (Adam's folks have a large house with a pool) where they spend hours in intellectual games and conversing about their summer jobs, future, and each's philosophy of life.Jeff has no girlfriend, nor does he seem to be looking for one. Angie, who both kid's parents think would be an ideal match for Jeff, is going out with a college student 9 years older, and is thus unavailable.  One day, in Vick's car, Jeff sees a girl named Jessie who Vick knows, and instantly falls head over heels in love. Jessie happens to be renting a room over the garage at Adam's house (very convenient), and before too long, the two are seeing a lot of each other.  And the meaning of the title becomes clear.Good writing is good writing, no matter what it is about.  And despite the fact that this is nothing like any of the other Ike Hamill books that I have read in terms of genre or plot devices, it is still indubitably Ike Hamill just like THE BODY by Stephen King is nothing like THE STAND or 'SALEM'S LOT but is still quite recognizably Stephen King.  And here's the most amazing thing about this newly released novel: it was written in 2009, 2 years before Hamill published his first novel.  I suspect that it was touched up here and there in the intervening 6 years, but maybe Hamill was just born knowing how to write.Finally, there is a delicious twist near the end that I did not see coming at all, despite there having been at least a few clues given by the author.Highly Recommended.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZCQP3NMKDBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XHAUIC#wasThisHelpful","R20ZCQP3NMKDBX","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INHABITED is the fifth or sixth Ike Hamill novel that I have read since first discovering him less than 6 months ago.  Hamill has a unique style of writing that makes one want to think.  Most of his novels are a little like David Lynch movies, where things are often not as they seem and one has to fill in the blanks for oneself.  The previous Hamill novels that I've read were all thrillers, Stephen King-like in plot (but completely original), and mostly horror, sometimes tinged with science fiction.  One trademark of Hamill's clean, brisk prose is that quite frequently things are deliberatey left vague, or ambiguous.  The monsters are just off-screen, just beyond our sight. The explanations for things are just a fraction of an inch beyond our grasp. That makes them even scarier than they ought to be, which is plenty scary.INHABITED is about two groups of teenagers, one a bunch of friends, the other a group of students, who are exploring an old mine for different reasons. Both are fairly well equipped for a single day (or nighttime) excursion into the old mine.  But almost as soon as they enter the mine, they find trouble.  The two groups get separated into smaller groups.  Things start to disappear.  Strange sounds are heard, and odd artifacts found.  What started out as a lark becomes deadly. And then it starts to get scary.INHABITED is another completely original story.  It's not what you think. But it is completely, indubitably, Hamill-like. Just when you think things can't get any stranger, they do. Just when you think it's finally over, it's not.  Hamill plays about with the flow of time.  INHABITED is plot-driven, but like the other Hamill novels I've read, the main characters, and there are several, are pretty well fleshed out.  The pacing is excellent, and the novel is hard to put down.Hamill appears to be something of a writing machine. He only started self-publishing in 2011 and he already has by my count 13 novels in print.  I haven't a clue how he manages to write that quickly, or that well. But he does.  I really hate to say this, because it is so badly overused, but if you like Stephen King (as I do), i'm fairly certain you will like INHABITED and other Ike Hamill novels (try TRANSCRIPTION and THE CLAIMING next).Highly recommended.JM Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRKR0WHWFLWAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z25JJC#wasThisHelpful","RRKR0WHWFLWAS","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INFERNAL NIGHT is (I believe) the first short story collaboration between F. Paul Wilson and another author that pairs FPW's Repairman Jack with the other author's hero, in this case, Heather Graham's  Michael Quinn, the detective half of Graham's Cafferty and Quinn series of paranormal (Quinn was brought back from the dead and Caffetry owns an antiques shop that deals in ""unusual"" items) detective novels.  In this very short story (38 pages), Jack takes a case from a rich eccentric who flies him down to New Orleans (Cafferty and Quinn's home turf) on what seems a simple case, that he takes only because he's bored since Gia and Vicks are visiting relatives in Iowa.  Of course, nothing is a simple as it seems and Quinn and Jack discovers that they are both being scammed.It's not bad, but it's just too short to be able to sink one's teeth into fully, regardless of price ($0.99).  I didn't get any sort of feeling for what kind of character Quinn really is, or what it might be like to read more of the Cafferty and Quinn series.  This is in sharp contrast to a subsequent pairing of Jack and super spy Codename: Chandler in the novella CODENAME:CHANDLER:FIX, by FPW, JA Konrath and Ann Peterson, that gave insight into both Jack and Chandler's personalities and modi operandi.The best thing about INFERNAL NIGHT is hinted at by the title, and will only make sense to fans of Repairman Jack.  For us, it was a lovely bit that filled in a bit more of the Secret History of the World long after I thought I had seen the last of it.  That's about as specific as I can get without a spoiler alert.Overall, just OK.

"SEEDS OF A NEW BIRTH: A GENETIC ENGINEERING SCIENCE FICTION THRILLER is the first of a series of SF novels concerning a genetically enhanced 'Kindred"", all offspring of Flip MacDougal who, in a hokey lab accident while visiting a friend, has his sperm altered and in an equally hokey plot contrivance, goes about for ""one last night"" with a group of former lovers who, Flip has just discovered, knew each other and had been sharing him, as a kind of no-strings-attached sex toy.  Each becomes pregnant from the last one night stand (despite that fact that all had been using birth control of one sort or another even though Flip had had a vasectomy many years ago.  Each experiences an accelerated pregnancy and delivers a girl in 9 weeks.  The children grow at an accelerated pace and possess awesome telepathic, telekinetic and other super mental abilities.I was primed to like this novel. The description was right up my alley. But the writing turned out to be only fair, and there are a number of errors that are either typographical or from ignorance (e.g., confusing stallion with gelding, confusing peak with peek and so on).  This is not great literature, but is serviceable enough for the story.  My biggest problem, however, and one that I could not overlook, was the terrible and unrealistic science in the science fiction.  The opening lab scene where Flip spills a beaker of some highly dangerous molecular biological reagent and then is told to to to the bathroom to wash his hands is truly laughable in many ways.  Dangerous reagent such as the one imagined here are never on a lab bench top- they are inside protective laminar flow hoods in specially designed Biosafety Level 4 containment rooms that people cannot just walk into.  Forgetting all this for a moment, if a spill such as described were to happen anyway, the decontamination process would be local and immediate, before Flip could nonchalantly walk to the bathroom, touching who knows how many doorknobs and handles in the process, and having a pee, all before bothering to wash off in the sink (while contaminating the sink and bathroom in the process.And then there is the magical reagent itself, that is described only in the barest of sciencey-sounding terms that make no sense.  But that's OK, since the whole story depends of Flip impregnating all these women with his newly mutated sperm, years after he had a vasectomy, which, in case you didn't know, cuts and ties off the tubes that deliver sperm to the outside world.  Finally, the reagent was created to affect the germ line (sperm and egg) - why then did Flip also develop telepathy?  I could go on but think I've made my point.If you don't care at all about the non-existent science and logic, and are enchanted by the idea of superpowered telepathic, telekinetic babies a lá John Wyndham's far superior and terrifying THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS (later turned into at least two films entitled Village of the Damned ), then you might like this.  On the other hand, for one that is a serious reader of science fiction, this one (that I downloaded for free) is a pass, which is what I intend to do with the rest of the series.JM Tepper","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRSDM7OX8AW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICC4DGK#wasThisHelpful","R2CRSDM7OX8AW1","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SCENES FROM THE SECRET HISTOR OF THE WORLD is a helpful chronological listing of all F.Paul Wilson's works over the years dealing with TSHOTW, complete with brief introductions written especially for this compendium.  At $0.99 for this Kindle-only epub, it offers glimpses of all the novels and short stories that comprise TSHOTW, in chronological order (not in order of publication), and includes books and stories that are not part of either the REPAIRMAN JACK series or the ADVERSARY CYCLE.  Although there is almost no new material here (except for the very brief intros to each entry), and one cannot buy this and read it like a novel or an anthology, it is interesting nonetheless for FPW fans who might well have read all of the RJ novels or the ADVERSARY CYCLE, but not the rest of the canon.  It might also serve as an introduction to TSHOTW and to both of the series referred to above for a newcomer to FPW's world.  Even for die-hard fans who have read (or think they have read) everything about TSOTW, there is a never before published very detailed chronology of the major characters and players in TSOTW that alone is worth the $099 for fans like me.Recommended.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJ4O5XO136NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4K7R3I#wasThisHelpful","R3GJ4O5XO136NB","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an unusual offering from author  Bill DeSmedt and  physicist John Adler. This is not your usual kindle only novel.  Allow me to explain. More than 10 years ago (2004), first-time author Bill DeSmedt published an outstanding sci-fi action thriller called SINGULARITY.  In addition to excellent writing and plotting, the science was superb (see my, and other reviews for SINGULARITY). Recently (in late 2014) DeSmedt released the sequel to SINGULARITY called ""DUALITY"".  It too, was excellent, and the science behind the fiction well founded in contemporary concepts in artificial intelligence and quantum computing (yes, that's a real thing).Here, in THE SINGULARITY FILES:AUDIOBOOK AND SCIENCE SEMINARS, a free kindle offering from authors DeSmedt and Adler, there are links to free downloads of SINGULARITY, read by the author, as well as printed excerpts from SINGULARITY and the sequel, DUALITY.  None of this appealed to me, free or otherwise, since I had already paid for and read both SINGULARITY and DUALITY. But, the new ""Bonus Feature"" that made me download this item  was the ""Science Seminars"".  These are 17 or so chapters (or seminars: ""Doctor Jack's Soapbox Seminars"") that comprises about 50% of the text in this highly unusual kindle-only offering.  THESE SEMINARS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT IS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW.  For the novels themselves, see the Amazon review pages for the novels. (Both are superb).The"""" ""seminars"" are written by a physicist, ProfessorJohn C. Adler,  who provided the nitty gritty science behind the black hole and quantum mechanics that are central to SINGULARITY's plot. Adler focuses on black hole physics and a bit of cosmology to bolster his theory, written up by DeSmedt in the novel as fact, that the Tunguska Event of June 1908 was caused by a microscopic black hole consisting of a magnetic monopole impacting the earth, but not exiting, instead, orbiting inside the earth, around its center of gravity.  This is an immensely cool idea.  The ""seminars"" are a mini (or micro or nano) course in black hole physics for the layman with a little thermodynamics and quantum physics thrown in.  One need not be a physicist to understand them, just curious with a bit of high school physics will do.  I enjoyed them very much, although there was little new there that I had not already come across after reading several non-fiction books in quantum physics and relativity by folks like Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, Paul Davies and others.  But for others who are curious, but not curious enough to want to wade through a bunch of (completely enjoyable and well written) physics for laymen, Adler compresses a ton of stuff into relatively few pages.  Bravo to him! It is a fun, interesting and easy read.  One small quibble is that it is (deliberately I think) written in a folksy, homespun style, often agrammatical, that set my teeth on edge at times. But this complaint pales in terms of the great job of making some very heavy (heh, heh) concepts in physics completely comprehensible to the average joe.Finally, you ought to read both SINGULARITY and DUALITY.  Or at least read the reviews.  They are both outstanding.Highly Recommended (how not, since it's free?)JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6T4CG950N66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080JGVPG#wasThisHelpful","RH6T4CG950N66","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DUALISM does for AI and quantum computing what SINGULARITY did for black holes, relativity and quantum mechanics. DUALISM isn't a sequel as much as it is a new adventure for Bonaventure and Knox, the heroine and hero who saved the world from a madman in SINGULARITY.This time out the excellent science behind the fiction revolves around true AI, made possible because of the advent of large scale quantum computing. Consultant Jonathan Knox is hired by the world's 4th richest man, who is a tech genius,to find his kidnapped 6 year old daughter. Time is of the essence since the little girl suffers from a seizure disorder that requires constant treatment to prevent permanent brain damage and death.But the as Knox gets closer and closer to figuring out who is behind the kidnapping, the situation morphs into a much more widespread threat to the entire USA. Bonaventure enters the picture, and the pace increases to supersonic.Well defined characters with distinctive voices distinguished DeSmedt's first novel and the same is true for DUALISM. Excellent research and scientific believability are also hallmarks of both novels. Ten years is a long time to wait for a sequel (The upcoming sequel was announced around 2005), but the wait was worth it. I just hope I don't have to wait another decade for TRIPLOIDY, the announced third in THE ARCHON series.Recommended.JM Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ZD5W3FQ7COP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB28K3G#wasThisHelpful","R24ZD5W3FQ7COP","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Advice that is often given to aspiring writers is something like ""write what you know"".  It must be good advice because so many end up at one time or another having their protagonist be a writer of some kind.  Stephen King has done it on multiple occasions (e.g., MISERY, THE DARK HALF, BAG OF BONES), and one recent example that I liked very much was THE PEN NAME by David Jacob Knight.TRANSCRIPTION is Ike Hamill's contribution to this large body of work and it is a winner.  Hamill is an amazingly prolific writer of horror fiction that I only found recently.  TRANSCRIPTION is the fourth of his novels that I have read, published late last year.Thomas Hicks is a journalist/writer who discovers a curious fact about a soon to be destroyed old prison.  Over the course of several decades, 4 men, who were notable for going on horribly violent, gruesome and mayhem-filled murderous crime sprees, all did so after being incarcerated in one cell in the prison.  Hicks becomes intensely curious about this strange pattern, and manages to get permission to spend one night in the infamous cell just before the long-decommissioned prison is about to be razed to the ground.Flash forward to the present where Hicks' son, James, is an early middle-aged agoraphobic alcoholic shut-in who spends all night writing, but never publishes anything.  James lives along in an apartment complex and is befriended by a much younger guy named Bo, and eventually two of Bo's female friends, Chloe and Danielle.  Slowly, as the novel flips back and forth between the late 1970s via Thomas Hicks' diary and letters written to his then-infant son, and the present, the explanation for James' bizarre behavior is revealed. It is a horror that James has carefully kept bottled up, but it is is accidentally unleashed and has the potential to destroy the world.Unlike some of Hamill's other novels that I've read so far, this one has no SF and is flat-out horror.  Although there are some pretty gruesome scenes early on, it is the slow reveal and insidious nature of what is really going on that is the centerpiece of the novel.  I'll apologize for repeating myself because I've said this in other reviews of Hamill's work, but the plot of TRANSCRIPTION really did remind me of a Stephen King novel.  I'll go further here and predict that Uncle Stevie would read TRANSCRIPTION with a smile and think, ""Hey, this guy's not bad"".  The plot is completely original and the writing is solid.  There are really only 5 characters, Thomas and James, and Bo, Chloe and Danielle.  The first three are the best developed, but I think I'd be friends with the all of them. At a compact 281 pages or so (I read my copy on my iPad), there is a lot of plot development and suspense building in relatively few pages.  I found the ending solid and appropriate, although your mileage may vary.Highly Recommended.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1O9AW50U3E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2K6HMI#wasThisHelpful","RA1O9AW50U3E1","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INSTINCT is part two of a two-book single story that began with EXTINCT.  Read no further either here or in the novel itself until you have read EXTINCT; the two are not novel and sequel but parts one and two of one story.The epic journey to find the source of the apocalypse continues.  Robby fell into some sort of catatonic state at the end of INSTINCT, and is being carried along and cared for by Brad, Lisa, and Romie as they try find the rest of their group that fragmented during the latter part of EXTINCT.  We get some more explanation of what is going on and what has happened.  In the interests of avoiding spoilers, if you have already read EXTINCT I think it is safe to say that Robby believes that all the events that have occurred are part of an alien invasion, but of an original and bizarre kind.There are very clear hints that this has happened before, and that it is possible to do something to stop it  There are strange glyphs in a completely unknown language that survivors find strewn, graffiti-like, written or painted on walls and various surfaces.  Looking at them under certain conditions causes very strange behaviors in the viewer.  The narrative drops in and out on several different groups of survivors who have banded together, first to just survive and then try and do something about what has happened.  The main characters speak with different voices and we care about them.  Some new ones are introduced and some old friends die.  Again, the ""feel"" of the story, but not necessarily the writing style, was very Stephen King-like, either by intent or subconsciously, as author Hamill lists King as one of his major influences.Just as in EXTINCT, the writing and pacing are excellent, and the book is hard to put down.  The characters are memorable, and mostly likable.  The ending is a real ending and is satisfying, although there remain several unanswered questions of the who and how variety that might bug some readers.  The same was true of Hamill's THE CLAIMING, and I think it is just a part of his own unique style of story telling.  It didn't really bother me at all.Recommended.JM Tepperdisclaimer:  I received an electronic copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGMYU22D9612/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPPQD68#wasThisHelpful","R3RGMYU22D9612","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BERZERKER is my first Theo Cage novel.  It's a SF-horror story set in North Dakota, one of the double handful of states that I have never visited. If the climate in BERZERKER is anything like that in the real North Dakota, I think I'll just take a pass.Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman Sean Chiller (nice double or triple entendre there), his wife, Tracy, and their little girl, Ashley, are on their way to Fargo ND to seek treatment for Ashley's cystic fibrosis.  She's got it bad, and lives on intravenous antibiotics delivered through an indwelling central line.  The prognosis is grim with conventional medicine but there is a clinic in Fargo, ND (not NYC, Boston or Quebec??) that offers a possible state-of-the-art gene therapy cure. It's winter and there is a horrific blizzard dumping feet of snow as Sean and family are en route.  Eventually the conditions are so bad that, in need of gas, they exit the highway and find themselves in a tiny town called ominously, Berzerker. The townspeople are strangely unfriendly, the one ""hotel"" is dirty and disgusting, and Ashley is running a fever and the Chillers have run out of antibiotics. The power goes out and thing go from bad to really fahrblonjet.BERZERKER is both sci-fi and horror, and both elements are done well.  As a biologist, I need for the science to be at least minimally feasible and that criterion is satisfied, with a McGuffin that involves genetically modified organisms or GMOs. The horror is scary, and the suspense, particularly at the end is high.  Interestingly, the suspense does not revolve around a big reveal, as what is really going on in the town of Berzerker is revealed to Sean and the reader about halfway through.  But there are other twists and turns to the plot, and eventually all the birds come home to roost.Recommended.JM Tepperdisclaimer: I received an electronic copy of the novel from the author in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NP0TT34TV4RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010IUKAME#wasThisHelpful","R3NP0TT34TV4RB","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first came across Ike Hamill with THE CLAIMING, an excellent and original modern horror tale.  I really enjoyed it and found that he had written several others (actually something like 13 since 2011, a remarkably large number of novels)!  I asked his what he recommended next and he said EXTINCT.  EXTINCT is actually part 1 of a two part novel (the second half is called INSTINCT and is not so much a sequel as a continuation of the former.  EXTINCT starts out introducing a number of characters in several settings.  Very soon, extremely odd and bad things start  to happen. People disappear in broad daylight.  A strange, rapidly growing prickly new vine appears in a Maine field. Strange tornadoes, killer streams and then a massive snowfall.  Pretty soon, the large majority of folks up and down the Northeast are dead.  Survivors meet up with one another (a la THE STAND) and follow Robby,  a preternaturally intelligent young teenager, to search for the source of the catastrophe.EXTINCT reminded me of a Stephen King novel, in particular THE STAND in several ways.  The coming together of strangers in the  face of a world-ending apocalypse, nature gone rogue, a young hero who knows more than he should, and an arduous, epic journey.  The writing is very, very good. Not quite as graphic as SK's, perhaps less vividly descriptive, but with excellent pacing, plotting and characters nonetheless.  The mystery of what is happening is revealed only very slowly throughout the novel, adding to the tension and suspense.And there is a kind of resolution and ending, but one that is much more like a semicolon than a full stop.  It is as obvious that there is more to come as there would be if the author had ended with ""To be continued..."".  Nevertheless, a number of the early reviewers quite clearly failed to see this and gave this novel one or two stars because there was no ending.  This did not matter to me, because it was so clear that all I had to do was look at Amazon to find that the second part of the story had already been written and published.  I suppose this accounts for most of the earliest reviews consisting of one and two star pans of the novel while the vast majority of the latter reviews were 4 and 5 stars.I liked it a lot, and downloaded and started INSTINCT immediately after reading EXTINCT.  If you like Stephen King's stories, I'll bet you like Ike Hamill's too.Recommended.JM Tepperdisclaimer:  The author sent me an electronic version of this novel in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26A3XZAR0PVJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3A97IU#wasThisHelpful","R26A3XZAR0PVJF","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ONYX WEBB: BOOK TWO: EPISODES 4, 5 & 6 picks up immediately after the events of BOOK ONE; This is actually a very long serialized novel, akin to Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE, that will ultimately comprise 10 books and over 2,000 pages.  As in the first installment, it constantly switches time periods; from the mid-1930s, the 1980s and 2010.  It begins again with a section narrated by Onyx, as a ghost in 2010.  The three main threads established in book one begin to converge as we get some strong hints to the relationship between Onyx and at least one of the other two main character/families in the novel.We get a lot more of Onyx in BOOK TWO: EPISODES 4, 5 & 6. Onyx is now all grown up and has, against her father's wishes, run off with Ulrich Schröder at the end of BOOK ONE.  Ulrich has gotten himself into some trouble and is now on the run with Onyx in tow.  Daddy was right, and Ulrich is NOT the kind of guy that you want anywhere near your daughter, but, well that's how life goes sometimes.  Onyx has turned onto a beautiful,  trusting woman who is also a fantastically talented painter, blindly in love with Ulrich.The founder of the Mulvaney dynasty, Declan, is an orphan in a church run orphanage, where things are, shall we say, no bed of roses.  One of the connections between threads is revealed in his story, that also takes up a substantial portion of the story, both in the 1930s and 2010. The story of Koda and Dane continues and gets complicated and a ghost in the story is introduced.And then there are Juniper and Quinn, and his Quinn's best friend, Wayne, in the late 1970s and 1980s the latter of whom finds himself in some serious trouble.Amy more would be bad spoilers and I want to avoid that at all costs.  I raved about the first installment , ONYX WEBB: BOOK ONE: EPISODES 1, 2 & 3 with a five star review.  This one is even better and I am completely hooked.

"ONYX WEBB: BOOK ONE: EPISODES 1, 2 & 3 is the first foray into fiction by the  Richard Fenton and Andrea Waltz, a  husband and wife team who have previously published a series of  successful motivational non-fiction books.  ONYX WEBB: BOOK ONE  is projected as the  opening salvo of a 10 book, 27 episode series.  With each book so far (Book Two has just been released) coming in at well over 200 pages, OW looks to be a 2,000 page story.But this is good news for lovers of mysteries, ghost stories and horror fiction, as OW 1 is a very interesting, thrilling opening to the longer story.  It flips back and forth in time from 1904 to 2010, with several intermediary stops during which the main characters are introduced.  The opening narration is by Onyx, who in 2010 is a ghost, but somehow still able to interact with the world of the living.  As a little girl in 1904, she is abducted at the St. Louis Exposition by an insane serial killer, but with the help of her father, Catfish and a police detective, she manages to escape, freeing the imprisoned next victim just before she was about to be killed as well.Another story line opens up in 2010 featuring Koda Mulvaney, 20-something heir to a billion dollar family fortune, who with his pal, Dane, has just managed to blow $20M of his inheritance in 2 years flying around the world staying at the most expensive hotels and partying his ass off with wine (mostly Crystal) and women until his father yanks him back home and puts him to work.And finally in 1971 we meet Juniper Cole, child piano prodigy appearing on the Tonight Show and then a few years later, as a beautiful young woman living with her brother-guardian Quinn who dropped out of College to care for Juniper when they father disappeared with another woman and their mother disappeared into the bottom of a bottle.,There is no possible way to connect all these events and people, as EPISODES 1, 2 & 3 are merely the set up (part of the set-up) to a very large and complicated story that will span over 100 years.  But the writing and pacing are terrific.  There are already several very likable characters as well as some not-so-likable ones, and there is Onyx, who hardly appears at all.If the rest of this series is anything like the ONYX WEBB: BOOK ONE: EPISODES 1, 2 &3, anyone who enjoys a good ghost story, a mystery and/or a thriller will certainly like this.  This is not a children's book.  It contains no graphic sex but does contain some graphic violence, but Fenton and Webb manage to (skillfully) keep most of that stuff implied and/or off-screen, so if one likes horror thrillers that are PG-13 rated, here you go.Highly recommendedJM Tepperdisclaimer:  I received an e-copy of this novel in exchange for a no-strings-attached review .","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQ9484XOBL7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIP8KLC#wasThisHelpful","R2FQ9484XOBL7Y","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Crescendo CR-10 capo is a well-made, beautiful spring lock alloy capo.  Mine is electroplated in some gold colored substance and really looks great with my Les Paul Deluxe Gold top and Gibson CS-356 Custom, both of which have gold plated hardware.  The capo works great.  As you can see from the image on the Amazon page, the mechanism is on the bottom, leaving only the bar on top that makes for maximum playability.

"THE CLAIMING is a scary, anxiety-provoking modern horror story that is completely original despite evoking a feeling of familiarity, like a folk tale that is half remembered or a cultural meme that one can’t quite place.  Leo and Maria Webb-Sutley have just moved into a large but surprisingly inexpensive and rather run-down mansion that backs onto a cornfield in a high class but strangely deserted neighborhood. Maria is an architect with a new job and Leo (short for Leona) is deliberately unemployed, so that she can work on renovating the house that they intend to flip for a quick profit.  Reed has just entered the 10th grade in a new school and Lizzy and Kyra are about 8 and 6 years old respectively.Author Hamill takes his time introducing all five and their family dynamic that is completely typical, save for the fact that there are two moms and no dad. Reed is a good kid, regular stand-up guy, and the two little girls are best buddies.  The reason that the neighborhood is deserted is not entirely clear, but adds a little creepiness.  The deeper one reads, the creepier things get.  They adopt a faun after its mother is killed by some kind of predator and raise it as a pet after the girls fall in love with it.  Leo and Maria are not so happy about it but can't find anyone to take it.  Things really start getting very weird when Lizzy starts seeing strange people dressed in robes that set off screaming fits.  By this time a feeling of inexorable dread and unease sets in for the reader (for some reason I was reminded of the original film “The Wickerman”, even though the plots of this novel and that movie share almost nothing in common).And then things start to get bloody -  very bloody.  Disaster strikes the family. There is violence and mayhem.  The sanity of some of the main characters begins to come into question.  The family dynamic breaks down.  And worse.  To say any more is to give away too much in this entirely original, yet still somehow familiar thriller.The writing is excellent and the pacing starts out slow and deliberate, and then begins a steady speed-up as the situation deteriorates from bad to very bad to unthinkable and then some.  This is very much a plot driven novel, but Maria, Reed, Leo and the two girls are described in enough detail to make them three-dimensional characters that one cares about.  I read a lot of horror and want to be scared, afraid to turn the page to see what is coming but at the same time needing to turn the pages faster and faster.  THE CLAIMING did that for me, in much the same way that the best of Stephen King, F. Paul Wilson, Blake Crouch, William Peter Blatty and a handful of others have done previously.There is my first Ike Hamill novel and there are bunch of others out there that I look forward to with great relish.Highly recommended.JM TepperDisclaimer:  I received a free, no-strings-attached electronic copy of THE CLAIMING from the author with no guarantees that I would even finish it.

"This is the first and only headlamp that I have ever owned, so perhaps take my enthusiastic review with a grain of salt. My headlamp looks just like the rendering on the Amazon page, although one cannot have the main LED the two smaller side LEDs and the little red LED on all the time, as they are all active in one or more of the 5 different modes that the lamp has.Opening the lamp to insert the 3 (included) AAA batteries is a snap and there is only a single, conveniently large button on the top to control the thing.  A single click turns it on and repeating the singe click turns it off.  The next single click turns it back on, but also toggles between the main LED and the two smaller side LEDs.  Holding the button down in either mode decreases the intensity from what (to me) is blindingly bright to very dim and then eventually off.Switching to either the red light, red strobe or side lamps strobe is a little more tricky.  It seems to involve holding the button down for a few seconds depending on which of the two main modes you're in.  I've only had the lamp for a hour or so and now have gotten all modes to work by trial and error, but I can only switch between the main LED and side LEDs and adjust brightness with any confidence or reliability.  I'm sure I'll eventually figure out how to consistently access these other 3 modes, but it's not clear from my one hour experience or the one page instruction manual, and this caused me to deduct one star from my rating..The headband is comfortable and easy to adjust and the lamp assembly is small and lightweight.I originally ordered this for my wife who runs, sometimes as dusk, but I can think of a zillion uses for it, starting with looking under the bed or couch or on the floor for a small dropped item.

"INFERNAL starts off with a bang  and accelerates from there.  Richard Farris and his Saint Bernard, Charlie, are are minding their own business in an isolated Kansas house during a huge snowstorm and power outage, when Charlie brings back a bloody mitten.  Richard ventures out into a blizzard and finds a young woman, barely alive, bleeding from a gunshot wound.  Other than the fact that she has some new kind of cell phone that Richard can't figure out how to work, there is nothing unusual except that the woman is badly hurt and will likely bleed out if RIchard can't get her to a doctor  very soon.The next day an unrecognizable paramilitary force arrives, breaking down the door, guns a'blazing.  From out of nowhere, Richard pulls out some firepower of his own and fights back, both for his and the unknown woman's life. Farris is more than he seems.INFERNAL starts out a a simple, exciting military thriller.  Lots of gunplay, helicopters  and chases.  Just when you think you have a handle at least on the genre, INFERNAL takes a rather abrupt left into interesting SF based around the concept of a multiverse, consisting of an infinitude of universes like ours, but differing from ours in small details (for some) and huge things in others.  The bulk of the first part of the novel follows Richard and Sophia as they try to flee from world to world trying to evade the forces of BanaTech, a huge company bent on controlling the entire multiverse, and destroying Richard, who as it turns out, is someone special quite unique and dangerous to BanaTech's plans.  Just as you become comfortable enough to categorize this as a straight-up SF adventure, the author beers off at an angle, throwing metaphysical- religious considerations into the mix. Enough synopsis, to reveal more risks spoilers.INFERNAL is the first novel by Browder, who in 2012 released an outstanding anthology of very original, scary and darkly humorous horror/SF short stories (DARK MATTERS) and last year a novella, PLAGUE, a grim take on a medical apocalypse that was also excellent.  Browder has an easy way with words, ideas and plots - that much was obvious from DARK MATTERS.  His writing gives the reader the feeling that the author knows what he is talking about.  I don't know much about guns or the military, but all the gunplay and military stuff (and there is quite a bit) seemed very real to me.  The SF is also well done and his multiverse seems based on a one of the several currently viable theories of quantum mechanics, Hugh Everett's ""Many Worlds Interpretation, described at length in a recent Brain Greene non-fiction book for lay folk.  The characters are well formed, and we care about them, and I especially liked the dialogue, in that people in the situations described in the novel would really talk they way that thy are written, so if you are easilyboffended by 4-letter words in common parlance, be warned.I liked INFERNAL  a lot, as I did Browder's earlier works, and look forward to more, from any of his universes.RecommendedJM Tepperdisclosure: I wrote to the author after buying and reviewing DARK MATTERS and asked to be put on his mailing list.

"This is very short story about an American woman one month from her wedding who is jilted on New Year's Eve, by phone (!).  She decides to go ahead on her pre-arranged honeymoon to Glasgow(?!) where she meets a charming, young (presumably) Scot, and despite her former fianceé showing up, goes on happily (presumably) ever after with her new biracial (?!) Scottish boyfriend.I suppose that this is a first effort for the author - perhaps an assignment for a writing class (?).  The grammar, vocabulary and sentence structure are all technically fine, albeit on the simple side.  Where the story fails completely is in the description of the characters and the motivations for their actions.  To describe them as one-dimensional would be an understatement.  There is nothing there. Does Anna work? What does she do?  What does she look like?  What does she like?  Dislike.  Ditto for Robert, the ex-fianceé, and Alexander the Scot who befriends Anna.  Why was the significance of Alexander's biraciality?Why Glasgow for a honeymoon?  That made me laugh out loud.  Having been lucky enough to travel in Scotland several times, I don't think there'd be much argument that on a list of the 10 top tourist attractions in Scotland, Glasgow would be around #23.  Fortunately, there is next to no description of Glasgow either and I suspect that the author picked the name out of a hat and hasn't a clue what the city is like, or even bothered to do any research about it or much of anything else.I was sent an e-mail containing a pdf of this short story unsolicited, and asked for a review, an action that I consider spam. I therefore wrote a completely honest review in which I pulled no punches, made no attempts to soften the blows.  Normally I would not post such a negative review.MS.  Davis, in the future, and I hope you have a long and successful career as an author, I advise you to pay careful heed to all the things that I said in the review.  Additionally, I advise you to learn that all writing requires some research, even for a simply love story.  A couple of minutes of internet surfing would have revealed that Edinburgh would have been an infinitely better setting, packed full of  well-described landmarks that you could have used in your story to add verisimilitude (of which there was none).  A few Gaelic phrases thrown in is another thing that would have added some badly needed verisimilitude.  It's important the reader feel like he/she is really there - and the author is responsible for that, by providing lots of little factoids and examples to keep the reader in the setting and lend confidence that the author knows what he/she is doing.Lastly, I  strongly suggest that before sending our your work, you first contact a reviewer and ask if they might be interested in reviewing your work.  That way they have a chance to decline or not respond, in which case you just write them off.  I sincerely hope that these rather harsh but intended as constructive criticisms serve to improve your future writing efforts.J.M.

"SEVENEVES shares much in common with  a lot of Neal Stephenson's work; it's long, it's very well researched and well written, and it makes one think - hard.  Also in common with his last couple of novels, the title is particularly appropriate on at least a couple of different levels. SEVENEVES is a hard core, hard sci-fi outer space epic, clocking in at over 860 pages in my paperback ARC copy.Stephenson wastes little time, blowing up the moon in the first line of the novel.  We never find out why or how, but it turns out not to matter, because astronomers, astrophysicists and other scientists quickly realize that although the 7 giant chunks of rock orbiting where the moon used to be are not stable, and very bad things are going to happen in about 2 years. Like the end of all life on the surface of the earth.  The first 2/3 of the novel describe what the human race does to try to prepare for the inevitable destruction of everything and everyone on the planet, by mobilizing all possible resources and launching as many rockets and people as possible into orbit using present-day technology, and importantly, a key player is a non-NASA, non-government Elon Musk-type billionaire who can see what is going to happen better than almost everyone else and takes matters into his own hands.  The end result is a kind of a Battlestar Galactica type ragtag fleet of small habitats in low earth orbit centered around what used to be the International Space Station, rapidly expanded and enlarged with the NASA equivalent of bubble gum and shoelaces.  There is a lot of orbital mechanics here and lots of explanations that some may find tedious and difficult to understand that are fun for science geeks, but could have been trimmed significantly, although the simple facts of space travel and and rendezvousing with objects moving at thousands of miles per hour do factor significantly into the plot.  How the first part of the novel ends is surprising and unexpected (at least to me) although Stephenson gives us hints all along including in the publisher's blurb.The second part of the novel fast forwards 5,000 years, as against all odds, humanity has not only survived but flourished and is in the process of re-seeding the earth in preparation for recolonizing it, something that has only been possible for the past few hundred years.  Stephenson's world building, like he did in ANATHEM, comes into full bloom as we see the results of 5,000 years of selective breeding and genetic manipulation that was forced by circumstances upon the original spacers.  Instead of concentrating on space travel, this last part concentrates on sociology, genetics, epigenetics and politics, all done with Stephenson's flair for detail and plotting.I write this one day after finishing SEVENEVES so perhaps as it settles in my brain I will feel differently, but at this point, I think SEVENEVES is an excellent space adventure, but perhaps not as captivating to me as ANATHEM or CRYPTONOMICON, hence four stars.Recommended.JM Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7ZC8LSRHCBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190377#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7ZC8LSRHCBI","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is flat out the best Lightning to USB cable that I have ever seen. It is about 2 meters long for those who need extra length.  The cable cover is braided nylon and very strong.  Both the Lightning and USB connectors are extraordinarily securely fastened to each end of the cable with high quality flexible strain relievers.  This cable will not break or short out. I delayed this review by about a month to use the cable to charge my iPhone 6 daily, plugging and unplugging  both ends at least twice a day.  Nothing has changed over a month.  Nothing has loosened or shifted.  The cable is easy to coil up for short length use and is super flexible so immediately returns to its full length when unwound with no kinks or bends.The Lightning end is small and fits into my iPhone 6 without having to remove the Belkin protective case (also unlike about half of the other Lightning cables I own).  The cable is (unlike every other non-Apple cable that I own - that number around 6 or 7 different makes) also 100% Apple compatible. No message saying ""This accessory may not be compatible with this Apple device"".

"EXTINCTION  EDGE (THE EXTINCTION CYCLE BOOK 2) picks up right where its predecessor quit.  In the middle of an all-out war against a rogue bioweapon-induced full on apocalypse.  Author Smith still has more tricks up his sleeve.  After Dr. Kate Lovato comes up with a molecular biological counter weapon for the mutated Ebola/Vx99 super soldier serum that has transformed most of humanity into maddened, ravening, mindless beasts, you'd think all would be well.  Uhhh...., sorry not this time.  Although the ""cure"" does what it is supposed to, i.e., render the mutated Ebola virus once again deadly, killing off most of the infected, there is an unforeseen side effect.  A very nasty one.  About 10% of the infected are not killed by the new virus because were immune to Ebola in the first place (Ebola in actuality really has a kill rate of ""only"" 60-90%).  Worse, the virus triggers rapid epigenetic changes in the survivors, changing them and imbuing them with enhanced sensory abilities, strength, speed, Spiderman-like wall crawling abilities and worst of all, an constantly evolving sort of intelligence. These ""Variants"" are far more difficult to kill than the original Ebola/Vx99 victims and they're smart. Maybe too smart.While the middle third of a trilogy often proves to be a letdown, a kind of filler between the opener and finale in a series, this time Smith doubles down on the tension and excitement. There are a couple of new characters introduced and one of Beckham's boys who was critically injured in the first novel along with another soldier who lost both legs in another battle are left to defend Kate et alia on Plum Island while Beckham and his company are back in NYC battling for their lives.  As in the first book, chapters alternate between events on Plum Island and NYC, and the characters seem real, including a crazed general who refuses to believe what is in front of his eyes.I liked this novel very much and am now impatient for the finale but I suspect I have a bit of a wait on my hands.Recommended for fans of military sci-fi and those who like the style of Crighton, Rollins and Beck.JM Tepperdisclaimer:  The author kindly sent me an ARC of this novel upon my request in exchange for a no-strings-attached review, after I read the first in the series and asked for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LAGNKOSQJ6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RICW37Q#wasThisHelpful","R7LAGNKOSQJ6I","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE SPACE BETWEEN is a short story/novella (~100 pages) that occupies the space between the last two OUTLANDER NOVELS, AN ECHO IN THE BONE and WRITTEN IN MY HEART'S OWN BLOOD.  It takes place in Paris in the mid 1770s, and focuses on Joan, Jaimie's stepdaughter who in en route  to a become a nun.  Joan, it turns out, hears voices and is prescient. The fill in of her back story is fascinating and welcome.  But the most interesting characters are the return from the (presumed) dead of le Comte de Saint Germain and M. Grenouillle, the very mysterious frog-like alchemist/sorcerer/time traveler who knows what from several novels back.The writing is still enchanting and the plotting still captivating.  Ant the characters!  Often the weakest part of fiction, Gabaldon makes them all come alive and the complex interpersonal relationships are fascinating.  This novella focuses much more on the fantasy/sci-fi aspects of time travel and alchemy than most of the novels, and is welcome for it.  The whole series is an amazing amalgam of historical fiction, fantasy and sic-fi, military strategy and romance, and is absolutely addicting.Highly Recommended for fans.JM Tepper","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKNAFZCHQ77D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWSZMNC#wasThisHelpful","RUKNAFZCHQ77D","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EXTINCTION HORIZON is the first in a projected trilogy that mixes man-made monsters and the military.  As a tried and true trope (OK, enough alliteration already), a somewhat crazed General is behind the development of a serum that will create enhanced fighting men for our armed forces, something akin to Captain America.  Needless to say, something goes horribly wrong, and the virus creates insane subhuman monsters with a thirst for blood.  Years later, in an attempt to eradicate the Ebola virus, another scientist comes up with a man-made virus that in combination with Vx-99 creates a plague of superstrong, superviolent  killers. .These are not zombies, they move very quickly.  And they are very hard to kill.  And the modified Ebola virus quickly spreads to infect every major city.  There was enough science in the science fiction to satisfy everyone but a molecular virologist, and the research that the author did really shows.  The action scenes were also well done, and for most of the novel chapters cut back and forth between following Master Sergeant Reed Beckham and his men trying to control things in NYC and elsewhere, and scientist-love interest Kate Lovato back on a last-stand fort on NY's Plum Island desperately trying to figure out what the hell is going on and how to stop it.No more spoilers for you.  You'll have to read it.  When I did, I wrote the author and asked for an ARC of the second part.  That ought to sum up how I felt about EXTINCTION HORIZON.  Are there some flaws?  Sure.  Do I think the author will continue to improve as a writer? You bet. But for right now, as is, more than good enough!  I'll post a review for part 2 as soon as Amazon allows. For a fast paced, interesting blend of military and science fiction, try this one.Recommended.JM Tepper","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYG99UPQBTKXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJKUF1E#wasThisHelpful","RYG99UPQBTKXA","A2Z3IXZ17E88J4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love this particular product.  I first use either Millionails (which I like) as a base (2 coats)  or my favorite one Sally Hanson Continuous Treatment, Growth formula, which is a clear base coat type strengthener that is very long lasting and effective.  Two coats of that.  Then I use Essie's Grow Stronger which also adds more strength, but more important to me, it actually gives an ever so slight bit of ""almost there"" but not opaque tint that I really like….it's color without being color, and doesn't show wear damage or chips, and just looks more ""finished"" than a totally clear coat. It has a consistency that applies beautifully and doesn't show mistakes like darker colors do.  Finally, this combo of things is extremely long lasting.  Both the Sally Hansen base and these two Essie products are impressively fast drying, although I do help things along by using my hair dryer set on ""cool"".

"Absolutely perfect for making Greek style yogurt!  Yes, the insert mesh is fragile, but treat it right and there will be no problem.  The mesh is exactly what you need to be able to strain yogurt without losing anything but the whey.  I generally strain my yogurt for 3 hours.  Then I flip the insert upside down over an appropriately large bowl and all the yogurt falls right out into the bowl with no need to use a spoon to scoop out the insert.  I immediately rinse with hot water inside and out and make sure all the yogurt is off all parts, and this step is extremely easy to do as long as you do this immediately.  You can also fill up the bottom of the main container with warm soapy water and then dip the insert into that for more thorough cleaning, then rinse out well.  No need to ever push or rub on the mesh at all (and that could damage it I'm sure), and I keep utensils carefully away from the mesh.  I always make a yogurt batch of about 7 cups of yogurt and this container holds that initial amount perfectly. Of course from that 7 cups well over a cup of whey drains out, so the finished yogurt is a lot less than the initial 7 cups!  Great great product for Greek yogurt, a gazillion times better than other drainage methods I'd been using, there's really nothing better out there.

"My top favorite green tea for drinking with my breakfast.  Years ago when I gave up my lifetime of black tea with sugar (had to give up sugar, didn't especially like black tea without it), I didn't especially like that under flavor of plain green tea….until I found this one.  The lemon flavor is ever so subtle, hardly identifiable as lemon, but I think the lemon must moderate that under flavor I dislike.  I truly haven't found any green tea I like better, and I've probably bought 100 or more boxes of this tea over the past few years.  I also like how each tea bag is inside an individual foil packet, so that makes it easy to carry a few of these in my purse.  I'll add that I don't especially like Bigelow's plain green tea.

I'm rehabbing my long neglected nails and was searching for not only a good treatment/base coat product to allow my nails to grow and not break, but I also wanted an ""almost color"" that had a very sheer but slight bit of coverage and hint of tint, but which goes on smoothly and without streaks.  And something that is LASTING.  I got Essie's Millionails which seems pretty good as a base, but it has no color, just a nice shine.  I've bought about 4 or 5 Essie pale pinks (Ballet Slippers, several other in that color range) and none of them had the right color I wanted and when I put one color on each nail to compare, the colors were virtually identical, they were all too opaque and I didn't like the look so much.  But THIS is my holy grail, I adore this product.  It strengthens, goes on beautifully and easily with no possibility of streaking, it's sheer and imparts a tiny bit of tint and coverage without being a true color.  As I said, it's perfect for me in many ways.Now to price:  I don't know why this isn't offered at a reasonable price like the other Essie polishes and treatment products, but $23 is truly ridiculous (plus another $6 shipping!!).  I got mine at Rite Aid for $8.50.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKC9L8WITPW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XP84PLE#wasThisHelpful","R3TKC9L8WITPW1","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far, this seems like a great product. I especially like that what it does NOT have: No DBP, toluene, formaldehyde. That's a bonus for sure. I have terrible nails and I don't like to use darker polish (upkeep!) or fake nails. But I naturally have weak nails that break and split easily. My nails always do better with some sort of polish on them because that strengthens them more than in their natural state. After a long period of doing nothing and hating my nails, I tried this one and so far, it seems MUCH better than anything else I've tried (mostly Sally Hensen products, but a few others as well). It goes on nicely and dries quite quickly to a clear gossy finish. I put on 2 coats and several days later not a single chip anywhere yet, so it's protecting just like I wanted and my nails look pretty good for a change and are starting to look better and better because they are protected. I'm not convinced any particular product will magically change your nails…after all, once a nail appears not much much can be changed in terms of strength, and for that reason, someone like me needs a hardener for protection of an already weak nail. My worry is always whether or not a polish will progressively dry out the nail over repeated use, and at this point I can't answer that one, I'll have to wait and see. So far so good.I've tried other Sally Hansen nail treatment products in the past, and this one really seems the best of them all.  It's also worth adding that this dried to a very nice smooth shine, and it works well as both a base coat and a top coat. I can't see any reason at all to buy something different for the top coat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBRPWNIPRPXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032VKLY4#wasThisHelpful","R3RBRPWNIPRPXQ","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wonderful knife, but oh my, the price here is way out of line.  I just bought this knife at WS for 59.95!  But to the knife itself…..I needed to replace my 20+ year old 5 inch serrated utility knife that just couldn't be sharpened any more.  The 3 candidates I tried out (in the stores) were the Zwilling Pro 5"" serrated utility, the Wüsthof Classic Ikon 5 inch serrated utility, and this one.  I never could find this one in any store to ""play with"", so I took a chance and ordered in from WS online.  Of the 3 knives, I liked this one best.  The scalloped serrations are incredibly sharp (watch out or you'll slice yourself).  Zwilling claims this scalloped serration holds its sharpness, so I'll have to wait and see on that claim.  But it was definitely the sharpest of the three I tested, and definitely cut with more ease.  It was great with the usual tomatoes and smaller, softer veggies, and super for slicing apart a thick hamburger bun, and great for cutting a sandwich in half, so it seems pretty versatile.  Also great with onions.  So in the time I've had the knife, I find myself reaching for this one the most now.  To tell the truth, I liked all three knives a lot and especially the handle and weight of the Wüsthof, but I couldn't justify buying more than one of them since they all essentially do the same thing.  Like the other review below, I liked the wider blade and I think what set this one apart was the angle of the cutting surface…it seemed more natural when cutting and allows your hand to be up higher so your hand doesn't hit the cutting board at the bottom of a cut or slice.  I'm also a fan of this Zwilling Pro line with the angled bolster, which allows a firm pinch grip.  Great great knife, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZL06RG6SDI9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO4I68I#wasThisHelpful","RZL06RG6SDI9N","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second knife I've purchased from the Zwilling Pro line, my other one being the 8 inch chef's knife, which is fabulous.  I was debating between this boning knife and the Wüsthof Classic Ikon boning knife, but ultimately I decided I preferred the weight and feel of this one best.  Like with my chef's knife, I especially appreciate the angled bolster that distinguishes the Pro lines of knives as it allows a really great pinch grip that seems very natural, and holding/using this knife is extremely comfortable.  The blade has a mild flex which makes it very efficient when cutting close to bones.  I also decided I liked the narrower blade (compared to the Classic Ikon blade).  Overall, the knife has a substantial weight in the very solid handle, which I especially like.  Great knife overall, very pleased with it, beautiful quality and well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZX4F3AEBKJQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00807QE1E#wasThisHelpful","R1ZX4F3AEBKJQF","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always love the big heavy steak knives you typically get in a good steak house, and these are as close to that as I've found.  Many kitchen stores seem to have these now sold on an individual basis…I only needed and bought two because I had other steak knives, but if you need 12 of them, this price is pretty good and similar to the individual price.  They are staying nice and sharp and holding up well, but I also take good care of them and only hand wash, which I think is important for any knife.Here is a fuller description I found elsewhere:Tramontina Porterhouse Steak Knife Set, 4 Piece : Restaurant-quality steak knives cut quickly and precisely, leaving juicy flavor and savory taste within the meat.

"I got a couple of these at a kitchen store and love them.  Perfect size for fried eggs, and eggs don't stick.  I needed a couple more and saw a good deal on Norpro rings (set of 2), but I'm disappointed in those:  the silicone is rougher and eggs stick, and the small button handle is smaller.  This brand is considerably better, cleans very quickly and easily, and although the stated size is the same 4 inches, the Trudeau ring is slightly larger and also better for allowing the egg to spread out just a bit more.

"I thought all silicone egg rings would be the same, but not so.  I had a couple of Trudeau egg rings (sold here on Amazon) that are fantastic and eggs do not stick at all.  I wanted two more and thought these would be the same, but they are not….eggs stick quite a bit to these and the silicone is not as slick and smooth as the other brand, the silicone of the two brands feels noticeably different and these have a vaguely rough feel to them.  Sorry I ordered them, and I'm about to replace them with the Trudeau brand (yellow ones).  Although the size is rated the same 4 inches, the Trudeau ones are slightly larger and allow the egg to spread out a bit more, and I like that better.  Another negative for the Norpro is the little handle buttons that you lift the ring with are a lot smaller, the Trudeau brand has larger ones that are easier to grasp without touching the metallic part of the handle.  The Norpro rings are OK in a pinch, but I far prefer the other ones due to the slickness of the silicone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4U399VNFUIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ULC93O#wasThisHelpful","RP4U399VNFUIB","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this to use for straining yogurt to make Greek style yogurt.  I originally wanted a super fine mesh strainer of some sort, but most of the good strainers are very expensive.  I found some fairly fine mesh strainers with long handles, but I realized the handle was a problem in the fridge, and many of them were also large, but shallow.  This Culina one with the two side handles is absolutely perfect for my purpose.  It's very nicely made, deep enough to hold the 6 to 8 cups of yogurt I'll be putting into it, and it fits perfectly over my stainless bowl for draining the yogurt in the fridge.  It's easy to clean, and although it does say it's stainless and won't rust, I'll probably always hand wash it.  By the way, the mesh is probably not quite fine enough for draining yogurt directly on the mesh, but it's perfect when lined with the large Bunn 12 cup coffee filters I got right here on Amazon.  That makes the draining process very very easy and eliminates the issue of whether or not the mesh is fine enough all by itself.  And finally….how can you beat the price!  The long-handled strainer I just returned to a kitchen store was over 20 dollars more than this, and this one works better for what I need.

"After deciding to get an 8"" chef's knife, I started researching.  I wasn't sure how much I would have to spend to get a really nice one, but I definitely wanted one of a higher quality than my 15 year old Zwilling Classic 6"" chef's, which was certainly good but not fantastic, and in many cases it was just too short a length and I wanted something longer. Fortunately there are stores to go where you can really see, handle and even use various brands for comparison (Sur La Table as one example).  Reading reviews online is also very helpful to narrow down choices and see what is out there, but I've also realized knife preference is a very personal thing and I didn't want to buy blindly and based solely on reviews. Also, an 8"" chef's knife is probably not a good length to start with as a novice so one really needs to handle and test these knives before buying.  I initially thought I liked the Wusthof Grand Prix II, and possibly the Wusthof Classic Icon, both very nice knives.  I prefer a knife with some weight to it and a slightly larger, heavier handle, and those two knives fit that criteria fairly well.  But then I saw and held this Zwilling Pro, and it was immediate knife nirvana for me.  Aside from the superb weight, balance and size of this particular knife compared with all the others, I realized the main reason I liked this one best of all was because of the tapered bolster-free design that permits a perfect pinch grip without the distraction of a bolster ridge under the fingers.  As I held the knife, my ""pinch"" hit exactly the perfect spot and gave me perfect control!  What an incredibly huge difference that one thing makes, and how much easier it is to cut food due to that design!  As I compared the Pro with the other knives I had originally liked, they suddenly didn't seem as great to me.  When I began my search, I never gave a thought to considering bolster design as something of importance, but it really is!  The lack of a bolster also means the edge can be sharpened for its entire length, although this also means you must be aware of that sharper end point when handling the knife.  However, it is not at all a problem if you handle your knife carefully and with full awareness until you get used to this aspect of the knife design. This feature is probably not ideal for a user who isn't somewhat used to handling larger knives.Overall, this knife is a thing of true beauty and it's a total joy, very easy and comfortable to handle and use.  For me as a woman, it is absolutely perfect for my medium sized hand and has the perfect balance and weight.  It has quickly become my favorite knife and it's the one I reach for the most.  When on occasional special promotion from Zwilling (usually around 99 or so), it's a great price, worth every penny and highly recommended.  If I can judge by my much cheaper 15 year old 6"" Zwilling, I expect to get equal longevity from this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KF45ND1IGJY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK5OQO8#wasThisHelpful","R2KF45ND1IGJY5","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd been debating about buying a slightly larger block (25 slot) because this block is full, but decided this one is best for me after all.  I've had mine for a very long time, at least as long as 15 years.  It not only still looks beautiful, it has held up beautifully.  I just took all my knives out of it to clean it up, and it was looking rather tired and faded, but the quality of the hardwood is good enough that after using a wood cabinet cleaner and then applying lemon oil, it looks totally rejuvenated and pretty much like new again. I was actually surprised how fantastically it spruced up, and I believe you can keep a lighter color block nice looking more than the darker color ones, which would show scratches and wear much more prominently.  Judging from recent quality complaints in some of the reviews, I'm wondering if Henckels still makes these blocks as nicely now as mine was made 10-15 years ago.  I bought mine in a store where I could examine the block and the wood pattern, which is probably a good thing in terms of choosing a block with nice wood and no damage.  My only real frustration is the steak knife slots:  I have a couple of larger 1-1/8"" Tramontina porterhouse steak knives that I love but which are a bit too wide to fit the 7/8"" or so slots, so I have to use two of the upper regular slots for those two steak knives. I'm contemplating widening a couple of the slots for this reason.  My other regular steak knives fit perfectly, however.  I use the upper cleaver slot for a Joyce Chen cleaver and that slot is wide enough that my Rosle cheese cutter also fits in the slot with and above the cleaver with plenty of headroom.  I put a couple of my smaller paring knives in the lower steak knife slots.  Another comment about the steak knife slots:  I like their  horizontal position (compared to the vertical Wusthof slots, for example) so the steak knives and any other knives you put in these slots can be placed flat.  In terms of slot layout, after reviewed all the other knife blocks I realized I like this design setup most of all the blocks I saw because I like having the sharpening tool and wide cleaver slots at the top and out of the way of the other knives I use daily, and I like the scissors slot at the bottom center, and no other block is designed like this one.  The Henckels 25 knife block is equally nice and similarly designed if you need a few extra slots, but I decided I just didn't need that many slots after all and didn't want the larger footprint on my counter.  This particular 20-slot block is fairly compact and fits nicely in a side corner, so it doesn't seem too huge to me and isn't distracting…very easy to pull knives out of it quickly and it's heavy enough that it won't move or tip over.  Great block as long as the quality of construction and the good is still good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X3ALAP3QHZNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFNJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2X3ALAP3QHZNX","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's worth mentioning that I've also tried the regular CT's, and they seemed to be sized larger…I was able to wear a 7 in those and the 8 seemed a bit large.  So I guess this Dainty model is sized a bit differently.  The only negative is that the laces are too long, so I tie them making the bow part rather big and then double tie to take up the slack, and that works fine.  I think the laces were designed to go with the other CTs, which have 6 holes and thus need more lace length.  Cute style, too…I get lots of comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17AKX9X6LIE0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOAQT1K#wasThisHelpful","R17AKX9X6LIE0Z","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of a very short list of products I seem to buy over and over.  I have long hair, a slight tendency to be wavy and unruly (especially in humid weather), plus I highlight it so my hair is quite fragile.  I have fine hair, but a fair amount of it.  I wash and condition in the shower every day, but need more moisturizing before blow drying.  This spray-in, leave-in moisturizer helps a LOT, and as of now, I like it better than perhaps 6 or 7 other similar products I've tried, it's the best of the lot so far.  Unlike other reviewers, I don't find the scent objectionable or strong, and it disappears almost immediately anyway.  I apply a light spray from a few inches below the roots to the ends, and I'm always careful to not over apply it.  The amount I use does not weigh down my hair or make it sticky or anything, and when my hair is dry I can't tell it's on my hair but my hair does behave much better.  I do think it helps overall, and that's why I keep using it.  I use an additional product (a moisturizing oil from Olay) on the last 3 or 4 inches of my hair because the ends need it…Luxxtress isn't quite enough to deal with my dry ends.  But I definitely can tell a difference if I don't use the Luxxtress (I see the difference on the top part of my hair), and I've just ordered my 5th or 6th bottle of the stuff.  My last order was in early December, so although I use it daily, at the rate I use it, my previous bottle has lasted a good 6 months and probably won't be entirely empty until mid July.

"Sometimes it's difficult to find a pretty 70 inch round tablecloth.  I'm very pleased with this one as it's quite striking, and I like the ""busy"" paisley design because it somewhat hides minor spills and things so you can use it longer between washes.  It's machine washable in cold water, and if you remove it from the dryer right away it needs no ironing.  It is soft and drapes well on the table. Very pretty design, and the price isn't half bad.  It arrived in just a couple of days.  My only negative comment and why I took off one star is that the dark blue in some of the paisley areas seems inconsistent and a bit splotchy with very dark blue and then lighter blue as if the dye wasn't quite heavy enough.  I suspect these are ""seconds"" and that would account for why they are being sold at this price online (it is, after all, Ralph Lauren, and I the dye issues I observed would probably not be acceptable in Macy's or stores like that. The dye did not bleed into the white, but certain areas that should be very dark and solid blue are less than perfectly so.  I don't care much because I bought this for casual, everyday use and the price was right, but the dye imperfections might bother some people. I'll also mention that none of the dark blue bled into the white areas, it was just a matter of the dark blue areas not being solidly one color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGCH9G7RHKBED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTQTIAI#wasThisHelpful","RGCH9G7RHKBED","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this product probably 5 or 6 times, and I'm fairly happy with it.  I had previously tried Crest strips and they didn't seem to stay in place.  Perhaps the newest ones from Crest do, but I haven't tried them.  I liked the idea of the trays (that's what dentists use),and perhaps I got less irritation because the trays keep the gel inside and you don't get much contact with the mouth tissues.My main observations are these:1.  Obviously the trays are one size fits all.  They were OK….you put one on and then smooth out the gel so it gets on all the fronts of your teeth.  It's not big deal to do that, really it isn't.2.  I had best results from leaving them on 45 min. to an hour each time.3.  They did not irritate my gums, but clearly some people are more sensitive than others in this.  I expected burning, but they did not burn me.4.  This box is for 7 days…you could do it every other day, but I usually did it every day because I wanted to be done with it.5.  I always get very much whiter teeth, so I'm always pleased.  In fact, a LOT whiter, to the point where I was monitoring towards the end to be sure I didn't end up with unnaturally blindingly white teeth as some people do.I was initially wondering about the trays as they don't extend far enough to cover ALL your teeth and seem to be mainly for the fronts.  As I've been reading reviews, I read one that said the dentist trays are much the same.The main negative, and I would suspect this is true for these or for any of the strips:  I pretty much can't talk while wearing them.  I usually put mine on before taking a shower, then leave them on for the shower and doing hair etc. and all the other stuff I do.  That takes up a lot of the wearing time.  I always tried to get at least 45 minutes (I think the box said 30 min.) and sometimes got as much as an hour.  Perhaps that helped, but I could do that because they weren't irritating to me.  As long as you don't talk, the trays stay in place quite well.  If they start to get loose and fall down, it's easy to push them back in place.I was wondering if the new Crest strips might be better, but they are still strips and they cost a LOT more.

"Love this machine!  I used to guzzle Perrier, but that got real expensive.  This particular machine handles the larger cartridges (not all of the machines do).  I fizz at least two bottles a day, sometimes more, ad each large cartridge lasts about 3 months.  It's about $30 to refill, but I did the math based on how much we drink, and it came down to about 25 cents per bottle.  That definitely beats other fizz waters at near $2 a liter.  My soda maker has been going strong for several years without a problem, and although the bottles have ""expiration"" dates on them, I'm still using some that expired over a year ago and they are fine.  Obviously I treat them carefully and all that.  I don't use the flavor packets, I just do plain water and at most, add lemon to it at the end, so I can't comment on the various flavors.  Those would add greatly to the cost, of course.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OC92HTWX9KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPEALUQ#wasThisHelpful","R10OC92HTWX9KZ","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really good for a more compact size dictionary.  Pronunciations are given using standard phonetic symbols, and words are in a dark blue so they stand out nicely, with everything else in black.  The text size is good and very readable.  There are 100,000 words, phrases and translations, so that is better than some smaller dictionaries out there.  There is also some other useful information such as a glossary of grammatical terms, abbreviations, grammar summary and section on verbs at the back.  The French-English part is divided from the English French part with a center section (colored blue on the edges so you can easily find where the English-French part starts, and that section of about 40 pages includes info about letter writing, holidays, and some games.  All in all, a very nice dictionary for most purposes.  It has a strong cover and is nicely bound….the one I have has held up like new for at least 10 years.  I don't  know how the 3rd edition is different from this 2nd edition that I have, but I did notice that the newer one has the entry words in orange rather than blue, and I don't like that because they don't stand out quite as strongly when you are searching for a word.

"I bought this timer because design wise, it is the most like my previous timer, which I loved (Bonjour large digit kitchen timer).  Like my other one (no longer made, apparently), this timer has large, easy to read digits.  It is quite easy to set or clear, and the beeper can be easily heard without being annoying.  I don't mind pushing the minute button repeatedly to get up to the minutes I want because I mostly use this timer for shorter periods of time between 2 and 10 minutes.  For the occasional 40+ minute time setting it's no big deal to punch the button up to that point, no complaints there.  I like the larger sized buttons, too, as compared to another smaller timer I have with little tiny multiple buttons.  What I especially like is the large magnet plate on the back (a fairly large square, instead of two tiny and useless magnet dots like so many timers out there seem to offer).  This larger magnet allows me to stick it on a magnetic strip on my oven above the door opening.  The one thing I don't like as well as my old timer is that this one is much thicker and potentially easier to knock off the oven accidentally—my prior timer was very thin, which was a good thing when keeping it above the oven.  As for longevity, I haven't had it long enough to determine, hence only 4 stars.  I wish Wrenwane would make a design like the old and thinner Bonjour timer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPHODA1FEB0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOPICNM#wasThisHelpful","RHPHODA1FEB0O","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had his for years, and use it mainly for cutting up things like brownies in a non-stick pan.  I was never all that enthusiastic about using it for cutting lettuce….it does fine with that, but I never found browning lettuce to be an issue, so I rarely use this with lettuce, rarely have the need I guess.  I was looking at several other brands of lettuce knives lately, and some of the others have a much sharper blade than this one, so I think this Norpro knife might be better with non-stick pans for that reason.

"I'm surprised to see such low reviews, but the jury is still out for me in terms of rust…I haven't had it long enough to determine whether or not it holds up.  I'll come back and note that later if I have issues with it.  Meanwhile, I got mine in black at Costco for less than half the price here.  Someone said perhaps Costco gets a lesser quality one, but I'd really doubt that.  Design:  I wasn't sure at first, but now I love it.  I have a sink with a high lip that comes up over the counter,so other drainers don't work well due to the lip of the sink and the water tends to drain onto my cabinet top rather than into the sink.  This one, however, is on raised legs and the drip pan under it is also raised, so water drains nicely because it clears the lip and goes easily into the sink.  I like the overall design as well and don't mind the somewhat larger size…there is room to put items that need to be flat, it holds a few plates, and the utensil tray at the side has holes only at one side to drain below properly.  There are two removable slot devices to hold utensils such as knives upright (they don't fall over like with my other drainer).  I wasn't sure I'd like or use those, but turns out they are quite handy.  The drip tray pulls out easily on the sink side to empty and drain, and in fact, you can just tilt the whole thing when it's empty and water goes into the sink so you don't always have to pull out the tray to drain water off.  I'm not crazy about the decorative pieces of metal on two sides because they will get water spots, so I don't know why K. Aid had to put that feature on it, seems kind of useless.  The side with the glass holder prongs unfortunately is on the sink side so glasses would be in a spot I don't like, but I don't use that much anyway so I don't care.  I don't wash a lot of glasses at a time so I just put them in the bottom as there is good room for that.  So now it comes down to longevity and whether it rusts or not.  Only time will tell.

"I love this brush, and there doesn't seem to be a competitor out there like it…unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because the quality isn't so great and seems to have degraded over the years.  My first one worked well and lasted a long time.  The second one hasn't been nearly as good.  First, the idea of this brush is great:  the ""teeth"" of the brush don't get caught so easily in the hair (if you are very carefully rolling up the ends), and there is a ""release"" button you push to make the barrel free wheeling so you can unroll the curled end without tangling.  The barrel doesn't get very hot so it's fairly gentle on fine, colored hair like mine.  BUT….here's the negative…..I've had two of these in the last couple of years that had a brush barrel that tended to stick when the release button was pushed.  My work around is to push the button and manually unroll the brush, and that works, the the basic function should be such that I don't have to do this, it should just unroll easily while the button is pressed.  When I bought my second brush, I had to return it because of the barrel not releasing well, but the replacement did the same thing.  Made in China, and not so great or long lasting any more, I guess.

"Such an excellent film, and it provides a fascinating look into conditions in French schools today in terms of the Muslim students and their attitudes as they attempt to define their place as Muslims within a liberal, secular French society.  There is a real clash of cultures and values, and also a fascinating view into male-female dynamics within the French Muslim sub culture and Muslim male attitudes towards women in general.  Isabelle Adjani is simply wonderful as the embattled teacher who finally faces the situation head on in a surprising way and makes a stand, and the Muslim female students who eventually find a voice and stand up for themselves as Musolim females.  This aspect of the story was most fascinating and rewarding to watch. Overall, this is a complex, rich and tense story that takes place during a crisis within the classroom one day.  There's a bit of a surprise at the end that you don't expect, which also makes the whole story quite poignant.

"I remember liking this workout a lot when I first bought it in summer of 1982.  It didn't have any competition at the time and was considered quite the innovation in women's fitness, but it was a new idea for working out at home and great fun particularly if you were naturally flexible.  It was probably a bit hard if you weren't very flexible, though!

It can do a couple of other tricks (poached egg, fried), but I didn't get it for anything other than boiled eggs.  You can do up to seven eggs, and the piercer that comes with the cooker indicates the correct water level for however many eggs you are doing.  They come out perfect every time, which is what I love about this cooker.  There is no auto-off function, and when the water has boiled away the eggs are ready and buzzer comes on.  An auto-off is relatively useless because when done, you want to immediately immerse the eggs into a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking.  Overcooked eggs are rubbery, can turn dark inside, and aren't good, so an auto-off would not be such a great thing.  The only issue I've had is when I forgot to pierce the bottom of one of the eggs…..it cracked and egg oozed out.  But if you follow directions and properly pierce each egg, you'll have perfectly boiled eggs in about 15 minutes every time.  Easy clean-up, and I've had mine for at least 5 or 6 years now, still works like new.  BTW, when you can so effortlessly get boiled eggs with a little tool like this, why mess with a pan of boiling water, often-broken shells, and eggs either under or overcooked?  I never did many boiled eggs before I had the cooker, but after getting it I started cooking them a lot. The Krups cooker makes it so easy, and it's fantastic if you are on a diet that uses a lot of boiled eggs (Atkins!).  Easy-pleasy no brainer, good quality cooker and in my experience, very long lasting.  Side note:  appears to be the only one with a flat top, which is GREAT for storage.  No need to make a cooker look like an egg!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7G7BWTJ19BQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005KIRS#wasThisHelpful","R7G7BWTJ19BQ5","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book for a Women in History class, and found the content to be fascinating.  The focus is on women and what they experienced through American history from the 1600's to the present.  Many of the articles are about ordinary women, their lives, their marriages, their restrictions, their struggles, but there are also many great articles about notable women and their achievements despite great odds.  This book is a compilation of articles on a whole range of topics, and I can say I probably learned more from this particular book than just about any history book I've read.  I was left with a whole new appreciation for what women have gone through in the last several hundred years.  I'll add that this book does not have an angry feminist slant as some might expect (I expected this myself going into the class and the book).  Rather, it just tells the history of what happened and ""what was"" in a way that was pretty devoid of any particular social position.  You are left to draw your own conclusions about what you read.  Of particular interest were articles about the witchcraft hysteria, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, and the practice of abortion in early America.  The articles were beyond fascinating and I learned so much that I had had no idea about before.  Well worth reading even if you aren't in a class.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5G57EDFRO2KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195388321#wasThisHelpful","R5G57EDFRO2KS","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a 3-pack of these at Costco several years ago ($12 for three!!), they all still work perfectly.  This makes a great gym water bottle…easy to grab a drink with one hand due to the auto seal feature.  I load mine up with ice, sometimes I keep it in the freezer full of ice, then add water before as I leave for the gym.  It's not insulated, but with the ice in it your water will stay cold for a decent amount of time.  I only put water in mine, so cleaning isn't a big issue…I rinse the bottle, and just soap up the mouthpiece part, all by hand.  I like the carabiner handle because it's easy to carry and you can fit several fingers thru the loop.  I'm going to order the Grace version of this and I noticed the carabiner is gone and there is a smaller hole to loop maybe one finger through when carrying it….I'll have to see how well that works.

"My understanding is that this is a Penney's exclusive...I just bought a new one there on sale for $59.95.  I just wanted a fairly simple toaster....just one that toasts nicely!  So far so good.  I was looking for function and a decent construction and nothing too fancy in terms of digital goodies that would likely break fairly quickly.  However, this is one cool looking toaster, and it' actually a bit fancier than I realized from looking at it in the store.  The front lights up a bit in a rather space age way.  You put the bread in the slots, push down the lever, then either let it toast or then push one of the buttons such as ""defrost"", ""reheat"", ""bagel"" and ""cancel"".  The cancel button pops the toast up, no need to raise the lever.  The darkness dial ""clicks"" around, unlike most toasters I've seen that turn freely.  There is a little window shaped like a piece of bread under the lever that shows the timing progress by diminishing from a full orange digital display down to nothing, but not sure what the value of that is.  You can wind the cord around underneath the toaster for storage so no dangling cords.  It looks like a metal exterior...turns out it is anodized aluminum, and it gets slightly warm but not hot.  The top part of course gets hot, like all toasters.  I suspect it's a good idea to clean it off right away if something gets on the surface.  There is an easy to pull out crumb tray at the back.  Now it's a matter of longevity....that remains to be seen.  My last Kitchen Aid toaster lasted barely 4 years, but limped along for the last year or so.  More recently, the handle on the lever popped off.  And it didn't toast evenly or quickly.  I didn't want another Kitchen Aid.  The overall design and construction of this toaster is really nice, especially when compared with many of the usual other grands.Update 10/11/14:  So far I'm really liking this toaster.  I use only gluten free bread, which is often difficult to toast properly, and I've got the perfect spot dialed in for that toast, and it's toasting pretty evenly and is consistent each time.  Once I found the right setting on the dial, it only takes one cycle to toast the bread the way I wanted it.  I like the way the dial is set up...you can adjust bread by one click at a time, and once you find your setting, it doesn't accidentally move off that setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP0M6CLR57A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ397YO#wasThisHelpful","RP0M6CLR57A","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great roaster for garlic, BUT….it's hard to believe the current price.  I've had mine for 8 to 10 years at least, still works well, but I originally paid around $20 for it.  I can't imagine why it's so much now, except that it's apparently in short supply.  In terms of function, it's great and surprisingly quick.  It's large enough to roast 4 or 5 heads of garlic, depending on the size of course.  Easy to clean up, too.

"Since these are being sold, I thought I'd offer some comments.  First, I love this phone.  We bought three of them in 2007. Phone 1 is still going strong.  Phone 2 was dropped or got in water (teen son) and died.  Phone 3 was virtually never used...it was a secondary phone I kept in my purse and occasionally turned it on, but in 7 years I bet it had no more than 10 hours of talk time on it.  Seriously!  It was never dropped, it had a protective case, it still looks brand new.  Out of nowhere, when I turned it on all I got was a black screen that was a Bootloader screen that gave software versions, and said I needed to program it and connect a USB data cable.  Sounds  do-able, but no go.  I've searched everywhere, I've taken the phone to various phone guru repair people, and no one can do anything with it.  They are guessing that the internals (ROM perhaps) is corrupted, or some such, but the bottom line is that nothing can apparently get it going agian.  I've emailed Motorola with all the relevant information, but frankly, I don't expect to hear back from them.  If I do get useful info one way or the other, I'll note it on this review later.Meanwhile, I wouldn't really advise buying a used Razr because it's a real roll of the dice at this point, and just know that if you have issues with what you buy, the likelihood of fixing it seems to be less than zero.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMTWYUFLT4GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009FCAJA#wasThisHelpful","R1DMTWYUFLT4GR","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I switch around shampoos from time to time, but I really love this one and will stick with it for awhile I'm sure.  It is a lovely consistency, not too thick and not too thin, so you don't have to use a lot of it to get a good lather.  It has a fabulous, subtle scent.  It cleans beautifully and washes out well. This is 33 oz and I paid half this cost for only an 8 oz bottle from my hairdresser, so the price here on Amazon for this size is fantastic.  I'll also mention that this particular seller wrapped the bottle and especially the pump cap very nicely with bubble wrap so it wouldn't leak or bump around in the box, and I appreciated that.

"This show is such a guilty pleasure, but I love to watch it.  I spent two years in Tehran leading up into to the Revolution, and I adore that country and its people.  I guess most of the Shahs group is mostly too young to remember much of Iran, and perhaps a couple of them were born in the U.S., but within all the over the top trappings of Beverly HIlls and the very rich orbit of their California life, I still see the Persian influence on their personalities and lives.  My favorite has to be Reza, but I really love them all with the possible exception of Lily.  I especially enjoy scences with their extended families, the food, and I love hearing them speak Farsi here and there.  I especially loved the visit to Turkey (Reza's comments on the veiled women were priceless!!), and their visit to the Iranian border was very poignant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WM2E6D1FBX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFS2J6C#wasThisHelpful","R13WM2E6D1FBX9","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 6 year old Sony HD TV that has only one HDMI plug on it.  I bought the Roku2 about a year ago, and it has been great in terms of how well it streamed.  Only problem was that I had to unplug it to plug in my DVD player (due to the one plug).  This Sony player seemed like it would solve the plug problem since it was both DVD player and had wireless wi-fi built in.  As far as I can see, it works great.  As others have mentioned, the setup is a bit dicey and the directions are almost useless, you have to feel your way through it, for the most part.  What you do have to do first is go to Sony's site and register the player, which has a 5-letter code you will enter there, specific to your player.  If you have Amazon Prime and want to stream from Prime, you can register with Amazon thru a link on Sony's site.  You'll get yet another code from Amazon, which has to be entered as well.  As for Netflix, I had trouble at first and couldn't connect, but then later I found a way to enter my email and Netflix password via the TV screen, and that seemed to straighten things out.  There are tons of sites to connect to, most of which I'll never use.  You Tube is there, also Hulu, Pandora, lots of other things and more than is stated on the box or in the descriptions, far more than my Roku 2 had.  So all works nicely for now, but the jury is still out and if I have issues I'll edit this review.I'll also mention that the price here isn't as good as BBuy at about eighty....they claim it's on sale right now.  If you get it there, and it doesn't work for you, you've got 15 days to return it.After things were hooked up, the resolution seemed horrible and I was thinking I'd have to return this thing.  However, now it has straightened out as well, and in one review here I saw a comment about the player having to ""sync"" with the television resolution.  I didn't do anything specific to make that happen, it just happened.  I also experienced a couple of loading hang-ups at the beginning, but that hasn't happened again either.  Streaming seems fine, smooth, so now I'm pleased.So it's easy to use, and although small, the remote is easy to navigate.  You press a ""Home"" button and that takes you to a screen with not only the DVD showing (if you have one in the tray), but all the different things to choose such as Netflix, etc.  This player looks like it does a ton of things I haven't even learned about yet.  The DVD/bluray part works just fine.  You can set it to load faster if you don't want the blu-ray movie to connect to the net (I guess some of them do that).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4GY72QHQLQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWKC0EC#wasThisHelpful","R1X4GY72QHQLQ2","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spatula is incredible for cookies, and most likely for getting under fried eggs as well.  I don't use it for eggs because I use non-stick pans and I don't ever want to scratch them, but boy am I tempted to use this with them anyway (carefully, of course).  The super thin blade slides under cookies with amazing ease, and I wish I'd discovered this spatula years ago if only for cookies.  It certainly does appear fragile to some extent, but with proper care (and perhaps not using it to turn heavy things) it should last a long time.  I wouldn't throw it carelessly around in drawers, for example.

"After years and years with a reliable old Sunbeam mixer, I searched for a replacement and hoped this was it.  What I liked was the larger, sturdier beaters (most mixers today have such small, flimsy beaters), I liked how it could be solidly set on end (it has a large, flat bottom, the retractable cord seemed like a fantastic idea, and the rubberized casing seemed nice too.First, the retractable cord isn't so great after all.  It's hard and somewhat laborious to wind it up back inside the mixer, and then fairly quickly it got stuck and I couldn't pull it out very far.  When I finally got the cord out, it had a major cut in the rubber, so now I don't know how safe it is now.  It's hard to get the beaters to click into their slots and once or twice they have fallen out when I start mixing.  I got a black case, but it does show splatters easily and isn't real easy to clean up.  The vents get flour in them and are hard to clean as well.  The mixing power is OK, although as others have noted, the slow isn't all that slow a speed.  The faster speeds seem fine.  As for sitting it on end, it's a bit clunky at times due to how the cord comes out of the case right at the bottom.I don't use a mixer all that much, but every time I use this one I'm thinking of the things I don't like rather than just using it without thinking.  I've had it a couple of years now, but I'll probably replace it once I figure out what to get.  Just kind of disappointed in this mixer, overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4MUH9V8WG9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043J9A7S#wasThisHelpful","R3R4MUH9V8WG9H","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands down the most intense, graphic, gripping and riveting war film I have ever seen, bar none.  Start to finish it does not let up, and as a viewer you are carried along on this wild roller coaster ride as you immerse yourself into the real life series of events that this film depicts.  The theater was packed with both men and women, which was interesting to note.What these soldiers went through to succeed in Seal training was astounding (almost beyond what most of us could ever imagine being able to do) and their bond to each other was simply amazing but also the necessity that kept them going.  What happened to these guys physically was beyond incredible (for me the most intense was several instances of having to escape by jumping off literal cliffs and bouncing down long rocky slopes, truly painfully hard to watch, and how on earth did they not end up with their bodies entirely broken in a million pieces?) , yet they kept going despite what seemed like impossible odds for a very long time.  Knowing from the outset that only Luttrell would survive did not detract from the story, but it made things so much more poignant as you watch events unfold as people were lost.I was very glad to see that the evil viciousness and utter cruelty of the Taliban was clearly depticted through not only their treatment of Americans they captured but also their eagerness to mow down their own fellow Afghans who do not agree with them.  I was also glad to see a clear portrayal of good and compassionate Afghan people who made it clear they did not support the Taliban (one man emphatically stating ""Taliban nistam, I am not a Taliban), and who risked their own lives to save Luttrell.  Overall, I did not see this film as a political commentary on the war either pro or con (although there were a few small things that clearly revealed the political frustrations our military has to operate under in trying to do their jobs), but before long I felt this film had boiled down to the Seal team's most basic will to survive under the most seemingly impossible odds in this war, this battle.As a woman, I have to say I strongly responded to this film despite how hard it was to watch and experience, but I'm not sure I could watch it a second time due to its emotional intensity.  It left me with such profound respect and increased admiration for our soliders and for these Seals in particular.  I would put this film into a category of ""everyone needs to see this.""  Most people have no idea what war can really be like at its worst, and why any war entered into must be done with clear purpose and resolve to finish and achieve our goals going into it.  No namby pamby politicians doing the back seat directing of war, please.  All this said, I did leave the film wondering why we keep going into wars (Vietnam going forward) but don't allow ourselves to fully do what it takes to achieve our goals.  Politics always meddles too much, and I feel angry about that.  Do the job right and then go home.Deeply gratifying was a long segment at the end of the film which showed multiple photos and some video clips of all the real Seals who died in this incident, giving them a much needed and well deserved face and honor that should never be forgotten by any of us.  It was important to be able to put a real face to the names in the film.  Real people who led real lives and who died terrible deaths, and who should be honored and remembered.  The emotion of this film will make you cry (or want to), and this was a film in which the appreciative audience clapped somberly but with respect at the end.Finally, kudos are due to Mark Wahlberg, who did such an incredible job both in his portrayal of Luttrell and in his role as producer.  He did great honor to the Seals in his telling of this important story.  I hope he gets the recognition he deserves for this film. All of the actors were absolutely superb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQF3AJL2594M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEPE6MM#wasThisHelpful","RJQF3AJL2594M","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted a crepe pan to make gluten free crepes, but all the ""nice"" crepe pans cost way more than I want to spend for an occasional treat.  I saw this one in Wally World awhile back, and for a mere twelve bucks I figured I could try it out...I have other cast iron pans that I like.  The size seemed perfect, and it's nice and heavy for heat retention (important with crepes).  First the pre-seasoning:  yes, it's there, but it's not adequate.  Eggs stuck horribly, as did my first batch of crepes.  I read about pre-seasoning by using a propane grill, and I figured that was a great way to do this since all the smoking that occurs would be outside, not in my house.  Verdict:  this works GREAT, highly recommended.  I used Crisco for the seasoning, and did it about 4 times (45 min. to an hour each time).  The pan is now incredibly smooth and slick, all the tiny surface pits are filled in nicely, and nothing sticks!  This seasoning worked so well I did my other two Lodge pans as well (the wok and a ridged grill pan).  If you have a propane grill, this is a fabulously easy and effective way to season cast iron.  Meanwhile, this griddle is great for crepes (I do use additional coconut oil in small amounts, it works great for crepes) and I can't believe a hundred dollar crepe pan would be any better.  The handle does get hot...I could even feel the heat through the Lodge silicone handle cover I got, although in general this cover works quite well and I recommend it.  Afterwards, easy cleanup as must always be done with cast iron:  wipe clean and wash it out without soap (soap will break down and remove your seasoning), dry well, then put over heat for several minutes to thoroughly dry it, then use a paper towel to wipe on a bit of oil (olive or coconut) to replenish lost oil from the washing.  Weight of pan:  It's certainly heavier than non-cast iron pans, but I like the weight.  It's solid on the burner (I have gas) and doesn't move around, it heats up evenly and retains heat (I heat on medium, but turned it down more towards low for all the cooking of my crepes or eggs).  I'll note that I saw this pan in a local kitchen store for twenty-five plus tax, so Amazon's price is great and I've only seen it cheaper at Wally World.  Cast iron is great as long as you get it seasoned properly (my experience is that Lodge's pre-seasoning is a nice start, but it simply isn't enough) and will wash and dry it properly.  If you do this, your cast iron will NOT rust.1-5-14: Egg update:  Despite all the seasoning I did, when I tried to cook fried eggs...even with quite a lot of coconut oil....they are fairly impossible to turn without them all breaking apart.  I was careful to keep the heat low, but I think it was still too hot perhaps.  I've decided that while this pan is great for crepes, pancakes, grilling sandwhiches, etc., it just doesn't work well for eggs so I'll use a different pan for that.4-6-15:  Update:  When I wasn't looking, my son and his girlfriend used my pan, let it soak, washed it with soap, and pretty much destroyed my seasoning.  I found out what had happened some time later when I went to use it and found rust on it.  Sigh.  But I cleaned off the rust and did my seasoning all over again.  I used crisco (works like a charm for this purpose), put it in the outdoor gas grill at the highest setting for an hour, and then repeated this about 4 or 5 more times (although after the first time, I reduced each time session to about 40 minutes).  Result:  fabulous!  When I went to make crepes I used a tiny bit of butter just on the first one, nothing else needed after that and the crepes slid around like they were on an ice rink.  Absolutely zero sticking, and this pan is so solid and heavy it just sat on the burner (gas) and I didn't have to touch the pan while I was cooking the crepes because it doesn't move around.  The edges are so nice and low that my long spatula could get under the crepes quite effortlessly for turning.  This is also a larger (but not too large) better size than most of the ""official"" crepe pans out there at 4 or 5 times the price.  I can't imagine any other pan works better, and for the price of $12  plus the time to do 5 or 6 seasoning sessions, I've got a primo crepe pan that I can use metal utensils with AND which is utterly non stick.  Note on heating the pan for crepes:  Allow the pan to heat up before the first crepe, but after I began cooking my crepes, I kept the flame between low and medium and never had to adjust it.  This was the perfect temperature.  This is also a great pan for grilled cheese sandwiches, heating tortillas and so on.  I don't generally use it for much else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JID1V1SVY27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008GKDN#wasThisHelpful","R39JID1V1SVY27","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These work perfectly with the Lodge 10.5 size grill pan, they line up with the grooves on this particular size pan.  However, I do notice from other reviews that the distance of the grooves on OTHER size pans are different so the scrapers won't work with all grill pans.  These work well enough for their purpose and I'm glad to have them.  They help scrape off bits between the grooves although they won't get everything, you still have to use other means as well to get everything off.  The grill pan is admittedly a bit of a pain to clean due to the grooves, but overall, these little scrapers certainly help a lot and despite being a bit pricey for what they are, they are worth the price to me.  Although my Lodge grill pan came preseasoned, I'm currently in the process of reaseasoning it myself and I hope that will help a bit with the sticking end of things, making it easier to clean than it is now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6T4RZ7MNXUJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073E3Q7A#wasThisHelpful","R6T4RZ7MNXUJI","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've waited until I used a full bottle of this oil before reviewing.  The test is always whether or not I'll buy another...and I did!  This stuff is amazing because after trying what felt like every moisturizing product on the market, this oil solved my flaky skin issues. I had previously been using Bio Oil, but it didn't quite do the job.  This L'Oreal oil is wonderful.  I use about 6 drops in the morning after washing and before my other moisturizers, and 6 drops at night.  One bottle used at this rate lasted 2-1/2 months.  I want to emphasize that once this oil has been applied, the skin is wonderfully soft and not in the least bit greasy or oily.  The only caveat might be if you have very oily skin you would  not want or need this particular product.  But for dry skin, and for ""mature"" skin it is a wonder!  I'm surprised people would complain about the scent...I'm very sensitive to odd cosmetic odors, but found this oil very pleasant and not at all strong.  Once the oil is applied, the scent disappears anyway, so it's hardly an issue.  I put the 6 drops into my palm and then with my other fingertips dot it around my face and then gently massage it in.  It soaks in very quickly and you do not look or feel oily.  A few moments later, I apply whatever moisturizer cream or lotion I'm using that day...I switch things around and try a lot of things for further protection and SPF coverage.  In just a few days my flakiness pretty much disappeared and has remained gone ever since.  My 64 year old skin really needed just what this oil offers and I'm so happy it solved my long-time problem with spotty dryness and flakiness.  I'll add that I've tried some of the very costly oil type serums from Lancome, Lauder and others, and while they were nice enough, they did NOT work nearly as well as this oil and they did not solve my issues.The price seems to be coming down quite fast...my first bottle was 24, my second one I found at 19, and now I see Amazon has an even lower and very good price on it.  I have very sensitive skin with mild occasional rosacea, and this oil does not irritate in the least.  I can say without reservation I consider it my #1 skin product and the one I simply cannot do without, and I don't think I've ever felt that way about a product before.  It's a real bonus that this is a L'Oreal product you can buy just about anywhere and it's very affordable, unlike the fancy department store brands (where I paid 60+ for half the amount of what I considered a much less effective product for my needs).  I hope L'Oreal doesn't ever stop making this product because I really depend on it now!  I can say I'm 100% pleased with it, and that's not something I say very much about cosmetic products.Update 1/14/14:  Still love this oil, just opened my 3rd bottle.  I've been tracking, and at the use of about 14 drops per day (7 morning, 7 evening) a bottle lasts me 2 months.  This has become my ""can't be without"" skin product.  The current Amazon price is the lowest I've seen anywhere, by the way.Update 7/5/15:  Stilling loving it, and in general I use it every morning as the first product I use, and almost every evening before bed (then I put a night cream on top of it).  This is probably the mostly continuously I've used any facial product, it's really a ""must"" for me now.  There are other similar products out there, even in the drugstore lines, but most of them cost far more for the same or even lesser amounts and I doubt they are any better so I don't even both buying them.  It would be crazy to buy one of those elite oils….I had one from Lauder that I paid $50+ for before I tried this oil, and honestly, it just wasn't nearly as good and it didn't do anything miraculous. L'Oreal's oil provides better moisturizing and because of the affordable price, I use more of it than I could bring myself to use of the Lauder product.  For my needs, L'Oreal's performs much better anyway.  Amazon's current price is definitely the best I've seen anywhere else, especially if you have Prime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R238STTIDVKKFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQG0PJQ#wasThisHelpful","R238STTIDVKKFU","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't a weight loss program.  Reading this book makes you put up a mirror to your own excuses and behavior about what you do when you attempt to lose weight.  The stories are Tory's life, but within the specific details of my own life I have ""been there, done that"" exactly in the same way she described, and this book made me see myself in a new light.  I don't know how many people say over and over how weight loss is so much a mental process more than anything else;  this is repeated a lot because it's so true.  Obviously one has to eat carefully, be aware of not overeating, and so on.  The diet details might be different for different people because the fact is, different diets work for different people.  This author found success with a low carb, very Atkins-like diet.  I related to her because after years of trying so many different diet approaches, I too have finally settled on a low carb diet as the only way to lose weight.  This is for ME, by the way.  It works for me.  Those who harp on low carb being dangerous or unhealthy simply do not understand the diet.So success in reaching a weight loss goal is hugely mental.  And that's where we all mess up and lose our focus.  Now that I know HOW to lose weight, the question becomes ""why don't I stick with it long enough to reach my goal?""  Bill Phillips of Body for Life fame talked about ""crossing the abyss.""  He also said ""real change starts on the inside"", meaning it starts (and continues) in your head, and what goes on in your head leads to what you see on your outside.  If the mental part of weight loss isn't solid and in place, if it isn't a continuing effort, you probably won't succeed.  This is the same concept Tory is discussing throughout the book with her term of ""the shift"".  Her ""shift"" is that glaring realization and acceptance that one must decide what is most important:  losing weight and seriously modifying one's diet (and sticking with it!!) in order to lose weight, or whether it's ""sort of"" trying to lose weight but through too much cheating and indulgence endlessly stalling and never quite reaching that elusive goal.  She calls these ideas ""preference and priority.""  It became very clear to me that for years I didn't have the  mental stuff totally in place, and far too often I was choosing my preferences and ignoring my supposed priority of losing weight.I love her idea of ""Preference vs. Priority"".  That really is weight loss in a nutshell, in my opinion.  We all have our preferences about what we'd like to eat.  How many times have you heard someone say they are ""desperate"" to lose weight, but they ""just can't give up wine, or bread, or this or that.""  So do we indulge our preferences over and over still expecting to drop weight easily, or do we make weight loss and eating the right foods in the right amounts a priority over our preferences?  After reading this book, I now keep this concept in mind every time I have a food choice in front of me.  Do I indulge in that little bitty donut or whatever it is because I really want to eat that, or do I put priority over that preference because for now, doing something positive to further weight loss is a priority over a momentary desire to eat something not on my plan.  Part of the mental success with dieting means you have these kinds of tools at the front of your mind. This book totally clarified all this for me in a way that other books previously had not.  There was nothing in this book I hadn't read or thought about before, but somehow Tory presented it in a way that made it all obvious and doable. For me it has become:  Priority over preference so I can lose this final bit of weight I want to lose.  No more excuses.  And I have a good strategy to stop myself from that pesky cheating behavior.Above all this, the book is a humorous, enjoyable read.  It capsulizes a lot of good points that I wrote down and find very useful.  I would say a lot of people just aren't ready for this quite yet.  You may have to reach a point of frustration over failed dieting, and that's where you realize that the source of your failure to succeed is precisely this:  in your mind.  She makes it very clear that endlessly searching for a ""magic bullet"" for quick and easy weight loss doesn't really exist.  I haven't found it in 13 years, and I have an enormous library of weight loss books.  I get something from them all, but after finally figuring out that a low carb diet agreed with my body more than anything else, and that the beautifully muted appetite that goes along with a low carb diet helps me stay on track, the final and missing component in my efforts was exactly what is discussed in this book:  the mental mindset about all of it.  That's the value of this book, if you are ready for the message.  Some of the more negative reviews on the book reflect that the writers aren't ready to work on the mental mindset just yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32V8F2QXVMPPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401324924#wasThisHelpful","R32V8F2QXVMPPE","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm finding this book to be an excellent overview, informative and enjoyable for me as a person who has an interest in the subject but who never really got to study much Humanities when I was in college majoring in other subjects.  This book covers a lot of important things without being too dense with detail.  There are a nice selection of very good supporting images, and the book is laid out very nicely and logically.  This is obviously a textbook and is presented as such, with a summary of topics and study questions at the end of each chapter.  For a true Humanities major, this might be too much of a general survey, but I'm enjoying it a lot for my own purposes.I know a lot of Humanities 1 courses currently utilize this particular text for intro survey type clases.  There are a couple of different versions of this text out there.  This one includes selected short readings in the back from the various classics that were mentioned in the chapters...such as writings from Plato, the Iliad and Odyssey, and so on.  The translations of the ancient texts are quite good and modern in style, easy to understand and enjoyable to read, and provide a good feel for the nature of these famous samples of the early literature.  Be aware that there are other versions of this text that do NOT include the readings, which are also sold within separate volumes of just the readings. If your instructor has assigned the text with readings but you do not require an access card to the supersite for the textbook, this is the one to order.  You can safely order a used version of this.  Another version says it comes with a Resource Center Printed Access Card (this would be only with a NEW textbook, be aware you would not get the card with any used book)  but that one does NOT include the readings, which would then have to be purchased separately if they are needed in a class.  The versions of this book that are out there are somewhat confusing, so if ordering for a class be careful which one you order.  I'd suggest getting the ISBN# for the exact text required in your class, and that way you will be getting the correct text.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KLQ5EFXNTZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0495569259#wasThisHelpful","R10KLQ5EFXNTZ4","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've now had 4 of these clocks.  The first two I bought 5 or 6 years ago, a slightly different design.  One still works, the other is several hours off and won't reset itself properly.  I bought two more like this one in the photo about 3 years ago.  They both work in all ways except one of them is about 15 minutes too slow, and it just seems to be stuck like that:  resetting doesn't help.  I really wish these lasted longer because everything about the design is fantastic:  Different levels of illumination are possible, from full brightness to nothing.  I keep mine dark at night, but touching the to bar once lights it up for a few seconds if you want to check the time.  It has two alarms that can be set for different times.  The alarm is soft at first, and each time it goes off (15 mintue intervals) it's a bit louder.  It's really quite easy to set the alarm.  I keep buying these, but it does seem they last only a few years at best.  Very disappointing.  Unfortunately, I've not found any other clock with these great features.  Too bad Brookstone can't figure out the problem with the resetting or whatever it is that makes the time veer off course after a couple of years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BODOFJUEIE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MB89GW#wasThisHelpful","R33BODOFJUEIE0","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying this is an odd product.  I tried it from a magazine sample, but the amount was tiny and it was hard to say what I thought.  However, it was interesting enough that I remembered the product.  After trying a second sample recently, I decided to spring for a tube.  The usual drugstore outlets had it at full price.  I got mine via a military PX for five less than the full price, but I have to say the price on Amazon is the best I've seen anywhere!  If I buy a second tube, I'll be purchasing here on Amazon!Now for the product itself:  You do have to read and heed instructions for how and when to apply it.  Ladies:  this is NOT a moisturizer!!  I'm 64 and have very good skin with fairly small pores and hardly any wrinkles, so admittedly I'm not battling big problems.  However, my big issue is a bit of dryness and regular flakiness that I constantly have to deal with.  I do a lot of things to protect and moisturize my skin.  Pretty much on a daily basis, mornings, I have to use a bit of scrub to remove small flaky spots.  Then I use an oil as the first thing...right now I'm trying L'Oreal's Age Perfect Glow Renewal Facial oil...so far I like it but the jury is still out as to how well it helps with the moisturizing.  I'm trying to reduce that flakiness, so that's my main goal.  So the oil is the first thing, then I use a moisturizer with SPF, various products actually, I don't have a favorite although right now I do really like Clinique's Even Better Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer...I love how it goes on, it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and it's a nice non-greasy moisturizer for me.  Rather costly, though.  After that I use the L'Oreal Miracle Blur Cream.  Yes, it's quite thick, almost like a paste, although if you dispense just a bit and rub it between your fingers for a moment, it softens and applies better.  Then I apply it very lightly.  It spreads just fine if you don't use too much, and once on, gives a lovely nice smooth finish that I really like as a base.  I put BB cream on top of that, then a bit of Bare Minerals powder makeup, blush, mineral veil on top.  Seems like a lot, but it looks great and smooth like those gals at the department store beauty counters, and so far I'm happy with what I'm seeing from the Miracle Blur cream.The real test will be when I reach the end of the first tube...whether or not I buy another one.  The jury is still out on this too, so I'll see what I think then.  So far, I do see a better look, very lovely and smooth without looking made up, it doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin, it gives a great base for the mineral powder makeup, it adds a 30 spf which is nice.  I'll update my review at the end of the tube.  Only negative so far is that it's a fairly small tube, so I suspect it won't last long even though I'm using a very small amount each time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QS716A5HXCHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQX87M4#wasThisHelpful","R1QS716A5HXCHD","A3PO3YRFX4BI2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PO3YRFX4BI2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How refreshing! It was such a pleasure to start this new Meg Chambers series, Winnie Wilde. My happiness began with the fantastically quirky and interesting lead character Winnie. It was so nice to read about an older woman that didnt fall apart when he life began crumbling. She was multi layered and so very easy to connect to emotionally. The love story at the heart of this book made it fun and entertaining. I really didnt notice the age difference between Winnie and her new man unless the characters brought up an issue, I found the story well crafted and the pacing was fast but definitely not sweet.

"Unfortunately I did not read the first book in this Dark Mountain series, which made me a lot lost when I started Desperate Deception. The hero and heroine have a past, and it would have helped me to have known the details. I thought the characters were engaging and interesting, especially the  supporting characters. The story is set in the Blue Mountains of Australia, and I really appreciated the beautifully detailed work D.B. Tait did in painting the setting. There are a lot of local phrases and definitions, as well as speech patterns to pay attention to, as well. There is a strong thread of suspense well woven through the book and the twists and turns will keep readers guessing.

"I started this book quite happy and content. I enjoyed the hero and heroine's meeting, and the premise was intriguing. The first half of the book, I toodled along quite smoothly.  I wasn't emotionally attached to the characters or their happily ever after, but they were interesting and multi faceted. The second half of the book just didn't sell the relationship for me. The exploration of BDSM was less than exciting, the scenarios seemed inserted into the story rather than woven into the plot.

There are three families at the heart of the book, and we follow each group during their experiences, hence three points of view.

"This bio of Lou Reed and his music was a bit heavy for me. There was a lot of really strong information, but I found it more music history than personal history. My goal in choosing this book was to find out more about the man behind the music, and I just didn't feel that I got as good a handle on Lou Reed as I would have liked. What is contained in these pages though, is a fantastically detailed account of the making of the albums and music I grew up around.

"There is a story here, including an alpha billionaire and a younger woman. The difficulty I had with this novel was that the passion and story were out of balance. There were beautifully written love scenes, however they were out of sync with the storyline, mostly at the beginning of the book. That preponderance of sexual activity at the beginning made it hard for me to get a good read on the characters, making it harder to connect and become invested in their story. Once the story began to firm up, I became more engaged and I was sorry to see the story end.

The premise of first loves reunited, of second chances at love usually appeals to me, but in this instance I never warmed up to the heroine. Not being able to connect and find the heroine sympathetic made me actually not enthusiastic about the romantic re-connection. I really didn't feel she deserved the hero.

The premise was really intriguing, 7 people on an island (wired with sound and cameras) must survive the brutal winter, like the survivor show; outwit, outplay, outlast, and the cast members that survive the 7 months will win 400,000 each. The twist comes in when you realize, the producers and the audience don't really care if everyone survives. The scenes are beautifully detailed; I think I could feel the cold.  The characters are layered and interesting, and the story itself is fast paced. I was expecting some adult themes and violence, and that's definitely what Show Time contained. Lots of twists and turns kept me reading and entertained. I think it might make an interesting selection for a book discussion group; lots of themes to explore.*I received my copy through NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GNO0XGI4T6TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007S0017C#wasThisHelpful","R1GNO0XGI4T6TD","A3L1Z0R3ZB2OFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1Z0R3ZB2OFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A sweet story, just a little confusing at times. I haven't read the first 2 books in the series, so I'm not sure if that was part of my confusion. The book started out well, Sydney Bristow laid the groundwork well. It was when the second chance at love story moved 15 years ahead that I began to lose focus.

"Though I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the ending was a bit abrupt. I almost felt the hero and heroine were happy for now, and I wanted more. I guess I like my books to end with the happily ever after in no doubt. I might have benefited from an epilogue, I suppose. I really appreciated the beautifully detailed settings in this novel, what a treat for the imagination. The heroine was a very layered and complex character, and I found her easy to connect to emotionally. The hero was just a little two dimensional for me, I wanted to see a little more growth from him to make his actions a bit more believable.

"I definitely did not find this a relaxing book. If you like psychological suspense with many twists and turns, you will appreciate the work of Alexandra Burt. I was impressed by the amount of emotion she was able to evoke from me, I began reading faster because I felt the mother's tension and need to find her baby. I felt at times that I was caught in a dream I couldn't wake myself from, which means the level of immersion in the story was high.

"I went with 3.5 - 4 stars because Lisa Marie Rice writes such a great story. The action/suspense/romance in this one is a bit unbalanced towards the suspense area, it seems a little heavy in politics. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book, or the series.

"I truly thought I was done with billionaire heroes, but Meghan March roped me in with this one. It's just such a tiny piece of the dynamic, complex hero, that it contributes to but doesn't dominate the story. How refreshing. This is the 4th in a series, I have not read the others, but I was not at all lost or confused. The secondary characters are quirky and memorable enough to warrant seeking out the previous books.

"I would call this light comedy, light romance. I just never got a handle on the hero. I believe it's because the story is told first person from the heroine's point of view. That made her a rather unreliable narrator when it came to insights into the hero. I really could appreciate the humor with which Elle Casey infused the book, her sharp dialogue, and the heroine's internal dialogue were laugh out loud at times.

"Having never read anything from this series put me at a disadvantage. Though I enjoyed the book, I think I missed a lot of the references to secondary characters and events. The pacing was quite fast, the action sequences compelling and the twists and turns rarely predictable. The romance side of the story was weak for me, perhaps because I just didn't have a good handle on the hero and heroine; lots of missed opportunities as far as I was concerned, there were holes in their character portraits that might have made them more approachable as a couple. There is a secondary romance that made a lot of sense and was quite entertaining.

"I liked it, I didn't love it. What kept me from loving it was that I had a hard time connecting with the heroine. Her behavior at times swung toward the petty and childish, and I didn't see enough growth from her by the book's ending, which really disappointed me. I found the hero to be both more mature and more complex. What did work for me was the baseball backstory and the plot itself. The overarching story was really well crafted, and I can see why this series is popular; the writing is strong, the characters quirky and interesting, and though this stood alone well, the info regarding the series and it's characters is compelling enough for me to give the series a look.

"I loved working with this yarn and its indigo blue color.  The saturation of blue dye in this yarn makes it a bit stiffer than lighter colored Vanna's Choice yarns but it is still amazingly soft.  I used 7 skeins on my shawl project and did not experience any splitting and only encountered one knot, which I was able to easily cut out and keep working.  I love how this yarn is completely machine washable/dryable.  I would recommend washing your project in a bag (I use a pillow case) if your project has fringe.  Otherwise, I throw mine straight into the washer and dryer.  I will be buying this Denim Mist again and again to make things for my blue loving family members and friends.

"There are 50 applique blocks of flowers and a few cute bugs in this fun book!  I love this book because it inspires me to create my own projects using any selection of these blocks in whatever format my imagination can dream up.  I think their style is whimsical and charming and my first project will be designing my own baby quilt featuring several of the flower blocks and maybe a couple of the cute bugs thrown in for good measure.The blocks are all 8 inches square but if that seems small there are instructions for adding borders to beef up their size.  The book begins with a couple of pages of General Instructions, which covers the basics of rotary cutting, piecing, proper pressing, fusible web applique, borders, layering the quilt, and quilting.  Schaefer also gives a bit of instruction on color and fabric choices along with some general information about yardage and fabric requirements.Scattered throughout the book are tips from the author to aid us in completing a well-done project...for example, Shaefer says, ""My best quilt-making tip is: Learn to sew an accurate 1/4"" seam.""Each block has it's own page, which acts as the layout diagram and the full-size template for the applique pieces.  The projects begin with single block quilts, where we can select whatever block(s) suits us or our decor and quickly work up a fast and fun wall hanging.  Or in my case, to go along with that baby quilt, how about a sweet pillow...or a crib bumper pad made by stringing several blocks together?  See, this book inspires me.  The projects also include a 23"" x 57"" table runner, 48.5"" x 48.5"" table topper, three wall quilts, and two lap quilts.  Keep in mind that we can substitute our favorite blocks for the author's choices in all the projects.The individual instructions for each project are comprehensive and very easy to understand and follow.  The one thing not included are quilting diagrams for the finished projects.I love this book and have included photos of the projects so you can see if it is something that you would also enjoy.

"Had there been a Look Inside feature for this book, I wouldn't have purchased it, as the look of the finished projects, is too primitive for me.  That said, I can see how those who love this look would be thrilled with this book.  Bonanomi has crammed this book full of practical and decorative projects overflowing with whimsy in her primitive aesthetic.  You'll find bed quilts, pillows, runners, wall hangings, sewing accessories, slippers, a jacket, jacket pins, and hooked rugs to keep you busy.Comfort Zone is chock full of instructions in how to achieve this primitive look by adding age/distressing to these projects using Rit Dye and adding rips and fraying here and there.  The supplies needed to make these projects are few and easy to find: needles, scissors, pins, thread, freezer paper, quilting ruler, and a rotary cutting mat.  Many of the projects would be great for using up materials from our stash/scraps of bits of wool and other embellishments like ribbon, trims, buttons, etc.All the projects in this book assume a knowledge of the techniques involved in producing the finished product: sewing, applique, rug hooking, etc. The templates for the applique are full-size, so no enlarging is necessary.

"The cute stockings on this book's cover hooked me. I am a fool for stockings, as I love to give them as gifts! In addition to the stockings, we can make pillow cases, top sheets, mug rugs, silverware caddies, placemats, napkins, a table runner, a mantel runner, tea towels, a wall hanging, a wreath pillow, coffee cup sleeves, tree skirt, a covering for a candle lamp, and a beautiful 52x72-inch quilt. Most projects are embellished with embroidery, some kind of applique (much of it using wool), and crayon tinting, which works beautifully, is long lasting, and has been around for a long time.The projects that made their way to my list is the reindeer stocking, the Christmas light pillowcases, the mug rugs (wouldn't they make cute potholders?), the table runner (with redwork embroidered text), the tea towels, and the ""Home for Christmas"" pillow featuring a wreath of holly and cardinals. Wow! I need to get busy!Each project comes with detailed/illustrated instructions and materials required. In addition, there are complete instructions on using crayons for tinting fabric (I recommend buying a separate box of white crayons if you're going to be doing a lot of tinting), cutting and piecing hexagons, and an entire section on hand stitching in the back of the book, which covers: working with wool, recommended threads/floss, needles, fabric preparation, transferring embroidery patterns, pens used for tracing patterns, applique, and embroidery. The embroidery instructions include: running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, fly stitch, closed fly stitch, Palestrina knot, rosette chain stitch, bullion knot, bullion loop, French knot, couching, satin stitch, lazy daisy stitch, and the star stitch. No worries, all of these stitches have illustrations walking us through them.There are no instructions for finishing the quilted projects, instead there is a website to visit for this free illustrated information. All of the templates/diagrams are full size and the embroidery diagrams are in color.Sprinkled throughout the book are a few of the author's favorite seasonal recipes, including: Cranberry Casserole, Razmosas, Salmon with Brown Sugar and Mustard Glaze, Crab Cakes, Christmas Breakfast Strata, and Super Easy French Toast Casserole.Happy Stitching!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CONDTK3OQIK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604685875#wasThisHelpful","R1CONDTK3OQIK5","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have loved appliqueing with wool for a long time and this book will be a good addition to my pattern collection.  I especially like the 29x46-inch bed rug, cute 16x12-inch pillows, and the five beautifully designed table runners.There are great instructions for obtaining wool (flea markets, yard sales, etc.), processing it (dyeing and felting), and tips for storing it properly.  Or it can be purchased ready to use at many quilting/fabric stores.  Also given are illustrated instructions for the easy embroidery stitches used in the projects: blanket, outline, running, whipstitch, French knot, and stars.  The tools and supplies list for creating the projects is a fairly short one with easy to obtain items that most sewists probably already have, such as: scissors, rotary cutter/mat/ruler, Sharpie marker, various needles, pins, freezer paper (I get mine at Walmart), and embroidery floss.  There's also a resource list in the back of the book for everything needed to make any of the projects.  A bonus, to my way of thinking, is the pull out, full-sized pattern sheets at the back of the book.I thought all the individual instructions for each project were complete and comprehensive with many color photographs.  All in all, I really like this book.All but two projects (a needle case and patriotic table rug) are shown in the photographs that I've added to my review. For some reason, they did not show up when this review went live.  I'll try again later, it could be a small glitch with Amazon.  Happy Stitching!If you like the projects in this book, you might also like A Little Porch Time: Quilts with a Touch of Southern Hospitality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q6IT9I1RZ8LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160705969X#wasThisHelpful","R1Q6IT9I1RZ8LU","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this book for the blue handbag pattern and hoped to find more projects to enjoy once the book arrived.  For me, the handbags were the stars of this book of classic patterns.  I also liked the pillow patterns, a lacy shawl, and some cute pincushions  but as far as the remainder of the patterns go, as lovely as they are, they are not for me.All the projects within this book are beautifully photographed and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  There are projects featuring Tunisian crochet and regular crochet.  There are nearly 20 pages of detailed stitch instructions shown with photographs to help with both regular and Tunisian crochet stitches.  There are also instructions for blocking the finished project.  These pages are very helpful.Included are patterns for wash cloths, hand towels, potholders, placemats, bags, scarves, pillows, shawls, pincushions, crochet hook cases, a ripple afghan, baby/doll blankets, cowls, and wrist warmers.Happy stitching!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZ6LTBNNP8PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570767246#wasThisHelpful","R3FZ6LTBNNP8PW","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I switched to the TrippNT Paper Towel Holder that dispenses tri-fold paper towels one at a time over a year ago, but my husband still likes to keep a roll of select-a-size paper towels in the kitchen.  I, too like the select-a-size towels but didn't like how I had to touch the towels and/or holder when my hands were messy/wet to tear one off.This Oxo Good Grips holder works beautifully requiring no touching of the towels or the holder in order to tear off a towel. It works just as shown in the video.  I particularly like the look of this holder and how little space its vertical design takes up in our small kitchen. It's also weighty enough that it doesn't tip or wobble when I tear off a towel.  All in all, this is a well designed and made holder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21M0AOMFV0PU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W8AF2S#wasThisHelpful","R21M0AOMFV0PU3","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Are two color quilts making a comeback?  They are in my world.  I've always been instantly drawn to quilts using high contrast fabrics and what better way to show high contrast than white and another color?  In this book, we see both red, blue, and sometimes both contrasted with white.  All are lovely but my favorites are those with only white and one other color.The Look Inside feature gives us a good example as to how comprehensive the instructions are for each quilt.  There are seven red and white, five blue and white, and five red, white, and blue quilts for us to drool over and hopefully work up.  So many quilts, so little time!  They range in size from a small wall-hanging, to lap quilts, and up to as large as queen size. Of course, all we need is a little bit of math to change the pattern to whatever size we want.All of the projects involve piecing while four have added applique.  The applique templates are full-size and the instructions for applique covers Basted-Edge, Needle-Turn Hand, Traditional Hand, Machine, and Fusible.  It is pretty much up to us to use whatever applique method is our favorite in these projects.In addition to the instructions shown with each project, there is a Quiltmaking Basics section in the back of the book covering Rotary Cutting, Cutting Bias Strips, Making Templates, Machine Piecing, Applique, Bias Vines, Quilt Top Assembly, Borders, Hand & Machine Quilting, Bias Binding Strips, and binding. These basics are a good refresher for the experienced and necessary for the beginner quilter.This is a wonderful book.  I especially love the cover quilt with the appliqued flower border (photo no. 1).  I'm pondering starting a new color trend... purple and white because purple seems to be the favorite color of just about everyone I'd like to gift with a quilt. :-)Happy Stitching!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29N3QU2KN4DCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604680512#wasThisHelpful","R29N3QU2KN4DCD","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've also used it under my dining chair cushions to keep them from skidding out of place and ripping off the cushion ties.

"The twelve drop-dead-gorgeous quilts we can make using this book are modeled after antiques.  I have long loved red and white quilts and I'm very happy with the patterns the author chose for this book. And, oh... the photos of the antique quilts are so beautiful.All of the antique examples are from the collection of Ann M. Hazelwood.  Ms. Hazelwood also shares the interesting history of the red and white quilt in the foreword, which I found fascinating.The finished ""replicas"" are lovely but what makes them spectacular and stunning, to me, is the machine quilting done in each and every one.  The skill displayed by those who performed the quilting is amazing.  I found myself oohing and ahhing my way through the pages.  Each quilt comes with ""Quilting Notes"" from the talented quilter.The book begins with a few brief general instructions covering yardage requirements, border yardage, prewashing, hints on piecing, half-square triangle units, adding borders, preparing for quilting, and binding.  The instructions to make each individual quilt are comprehensive and detailed.Also, for comparison, you might want to look at Red, White, and Sometimes Blue: Classics from McCall's Quilting.  I particularly love the applique that is used in this particular book.Happy quilting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYBX5QCC9R4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160460168X#wasThisHelpful","R1CYBX5QCC9R4W","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm currently on a ""two color quilt craze"" and my search for patterns/examples of such led me to buy this book.  All nine of Mary's favorite quilts presented within this book are beauties from the mid 1800's.  She tells us in the introduction that she wrote this book to share her love for them and to show us how to recreate them.I found the instructions to be straight forward and easy to follow.  In addition to those for each quilt, there is one page of General Directions, which covers a bit about Fabrics, Piecing, Applique, Mitered Borders, Marking Quilting Designs, Basting, and Binding.  One of the things I appreciated were the small diagrams of the quilting recommended for each quilt.

"Heese describes autumn as her favorite time of year and how she wanted to create her own ""designs that celebrated the season, only with a different feel than the typical motifs you see in autumn quilts and projects.""  The six quilts and two smaller coordinating projects, a ruffled table scarf and small wall hanging, accomplish her goal.  Fall is my favorite season too and I love this author's expression of it.  I am especially taken with the first project in the book, ""Splendor,"" an 80x80-inch quilt featuring pops of turquoise, red, and black.  (See photo one.)The book begins with instructions for needleturn applique using freezer paper, Heese's favorite method.  I especially appreciated her recommendation of using Fray Check on the edges of the background squares to prevent raveling and distortion.  This prevents having to cut the block and then resize it after stitching it.  There is also additional instructions given for appliqueing with wool and velvet.  A stitch guide illustrating the stem stitch and French knot is also provided.Each individual project includes instructions in fabric requirements, cutting, sewing, and block assembly with a diagram.  I think an experienced quilter would have zero problems completing the projects using the given instructions but anyone unsure of proper rotary cutting, pinning, pressing, and all aspects of finishing the quilt (backing, basting, binding, and quilting) will need an additional resource.All the applique templates are full size so no enlarging is necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B1M1COAV0Z9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611691370#wasThisHelpful","R3B1M1COAV0Z9W","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Margarete Heinisch says her daughter's admiration of a Baltimore album quilt at a local quilt show, ""set off the first spark"" in the back of her head to create her own album quilt.  ""Mi Amor"" is the result of that spark, a gift celebrating the 25th wedding anniversary of her daughter and son-in-law.  Each block in this magnificent quilt, symbolizes in some way, their life together.  All I can say is, wow, what a lovely gift and magnificent legacy.A CD-ROM containing all the templates, embroidery stitching, and layout diagrams for each block (to print out) is included.  The book begins with detailed and illustrated instructions for fabric requirements, additional supplies (such as batting, embroidery floss, etc.), fabric shortcuts (among others, the author suggests appliqueing silk leaves from artificial flowers), different ways to make stems, how to make circles, embroidery stitches (running stitch, fly stitch, back stitch, stem or outline stitch, couching stitches, buttonhole stitch, lazy daisy stitch, buttonhole scallops, straight stitch, satin stitch, French knot, bullion stitch, seed stitch, and turkey work), making yo-yo flowers, making rickrack flowers, embroidering ladybugs & potato bugs, using fabric paints, assembling the quilt, adding borders, adding corded piping, and finishing the quilt.Each of the 16 blocks is explained and illustrated in detail with the fabric requirements, supplies, sewing instructions, painting (if any) instructions, and an embroidery stitching chart (shows stitches used, thread color, etc.)  I appreciated and found very interesting the explanation given of the symbolism behind each block.The book concludes with what I thought was a fascinating explanation of the meaning of the flowers used in the blocks, such as: the olive branch means peace, tulip means beautiful eyes, nest means security, and so forth.This book has sparked my imagination and provoked my thoughts toward creating my own legacy quilt with blocks symbolizing my family's life story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K28VFU0848PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160460140X#wasThisHelpful","R3K28VFU0848PW","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our home has wood clap-board siding.  Our winters are pretty rough where we live and our siding, come spring, reflects the tough time it's been through, it is covered in dirt and grime.  This Krud Kutter worked pretty well when I used a scrub brush with it. On its own, without scrubbing... some grime remained.How I made this product work for me is after spraying it on, I let it set for a couple of minutes (as stated in the product directions), and then while it was still wet, I used a brush with an adjustable handle to scrub the siding. I wish less elbow grease was required to get the results I wanted but it wasn't to be.

My skin is dry and itchy and because I have limited mobility in my shoulder, I am unable to apply lotion and pain relieving creams to my back and shoulder for relief.It's so easy to use.  Put the lotion/cream directly onto the applicator head and rub it onto your back.  I love using it for Bengay because I don't get the product on my hands.  The applicator head is also easy to clean.

"I've been hooked on Lang calendars for many years now.  This year I've chosen this one featuring the artwork of Susan Winget.  I have to have a calendar to keep track of special dates and appointments, so I like having one with artwork that appeals to me and looks good in my kitchen.  In addition to its beauty, the squares are just large enough to write in a birthday or an appointment or two.  The paper Lang uses is heavy weight and has a linen look, which holds up to thumbing through to look ahead and write in upcoming appointments.  If there's a problem with these calendars it is that I cannot throw them away!  I have a stack of old ones with beautiful artwork that I keep thinking, ""someday"" I'll do something with those!If you love the artwork but prefer not to have the Bible passages, Lang also offers The Heart & Home Calendar, which has the same great Susan Winget art without Scripture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P1L711RVZI3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J80MQLO#wasThisHelpful","R2P1L711RVZI3A","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I received money for Christmas, I immediately purchased this book and one other (Tending the Garden) by Adams & Allen from my Wishlist and I'm very happy I did. I just absolutely love the large-block-applique designs put forth by these two talented women. The large blocks work up quickly and easily and before we know it, the quilt top is completed! A large size is also perfect for framing one of the completed blocks for wall art. These make wonderful gifts! When I'm sitting, my hands are never idle; I always have a quilt block to applique, something to embroider, or a crochet project.In addition to their signature ""Feature Quilt"" where Adams and Allen always give us their own creative version of it, there are ten additional projects inside the pages of this book. We have six more quilts, a hooked rug, two projects using wool applique, and a cross stitch pillow sham to get us busy. I am a particular fan of A&A's books predominantly because of the large block sizes used in most (not all) of their applique, and also because I enjoy how they often include non-quilting projects in them. In fact, I'm considering learning how to hook rugs. :-)The first two photos I've added show Adams' and Allen's versions of the 84x84-inch Feature Quilt; ""Winter Garden"" and ""Love Letters,"" respectively named. To tie in with the book's title, the authors' chose plants and flowers that remind them of autumn and winter such as the pomegranate, rose hip, oak leaf, coxcomb, and five others. Their showing the quilt in two different colorways always inspires me to bravely choose my own colors.""Autumn Thistle,"" the third photo, an 85x85-inch beauty has nine 20-inch thistle blocks surrounded by a very special border.For those who love smaller blocks, ""Trick or Treat,"" the fourth photo, is 92x92-inches of 300 appliqued, 5-inch blocks of treat baskets! Wow!""Garden Song,"" photo number five, is a delightful 24x9-inch project using wool. I love this project! Wool is so much fun to applique (and easy!) and this size makes a perfect table topper, wall hanging, or even framed wall art.Photo six, ""Harvest Basket"" is 83x83-inches, and has a bit more piecing and a smaller amount of applique.""Goldenrod in Bloom,"" photo seven, shows the designers using a bit of fussy cutting, piece work, and applique in this 80x80-inch scalloped edge quilt.Another appliqued wool project is shown in photo eight, this ""Birds and Old Buttons Pillow"" at 20x11-inches would make a sweet accent to any bed or seat in the home.Especially for Christmas, ""Holly and Mistletoe"" is an 83x83-inch stunner, which combines lots of pieced squares with beautiful applique. I especially love the intricate holly border of this beauty. Photo nine.The striking colorway that Barb uses here, makes the 51x51-inch ""Frost on the Ferns,"" (utilizing the coxcomb block from the Feature Quilt) really stand out. Photo ten.Photo eleven shows an interesting use for checked fabric...cross stitch!The 24x20-inch ""Rose Hip Hooked Rug"" wraps up the projects in this book. I'd have to display this rug where it would be safe from dirty shoes!When it comes to the instructions for the projects, it is assumed that we are experienced at quilting, appliqueing, sewing, and rug hooking. There is instruction for hand applique using the freezer paper method. The whip stitch is called for to applique the wool pieces. There are full-size templates for the applique pieces and each block has an applique placement diagram (this does require enlargement.) The pattern for the hooked rug is also full size.I am experienced in quilting and applique and could complete the projects, which utilize these skills. However, I would need an additional resource to make the hooked rug. By the same token if you are inexperienced at quilting, I think you would probably need additional instruction to complete the quilts in this book. For example, this book does not include general instructions for rotary cutting, proper pressing, and making binding, sewing the binding to the quilt top, making a quilt sandwich, putting together the backing fabric, and quilting the top.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25P62SA4SY2LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933466782#wasThisHelpful","R25P62SA4SY2LY","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was gifted $$ for Christmas, I hastily spent it on this book and ""When the Cold Wind Blows"" also by Adams & Allen. I love applique and from the moment I stumbled across my first book by these two creative women I've been hooked on their designs. The quilts and other projects within the pages of this lovely book are beautifully photographed and displayed.There are ten projects in this book, five quilts, two cross-stitch patterns, two hooked rugs, and instructions for dying a vintage crocheted tablecloth to transform it into a blanket.As is usual for A&A, they begin with what they call their ""Feature Quilt."" Usually this quilt is shown in two colorways; one by Adams and one by Allen. In this book, we see the 84x84-inch ""feature quilt"" done in three different colorways. (Photos 1-3.) Fifty of the 96 pages of this book are dedicated to making the Feature Quilt. The thing I love the most (next to the designs themselves) is the large, 28-inch block size used in this quilt. Right now, I'm into making framed wall art from quilt squares. Of course, they would also make wonderful pillow fronts, too. How about stringing your favorite blocks together to make a runner? I also enjoy substituting wool for the fabric. In quilting, the possibilities are endless and only limited by our imagination!The remaining projects are: ""Tumbling Lily,"" a 65x65-inch quilt with 20-inch blocks; a 60x60-inch throw quilt/wall hanging titled ""My Heart is Yours""; a sweet cross-stitch pin-cushion; an 11x6.5-inch cross-stitch sampler; a 35x19.75-inch hooked rug; a hooked sewing box cover; a 24x60-inch appliqued table/bed runner; dying a vintage blanket (no photo) and an 80x80-inch pieced (no applique) quilt, aptly named ""Summer Stars.""Each project comes with detailed and comprehensive instructions for everything we need to know to sew each block and the quilt top. Instructions are given for hand applique using the freezer paper method. There are full-size templates for the applique pieces and each block has an applique placement diagram (the diagram requires enlargement). There are charts for the cross stitch patterns and rugs. (The chart for the larger hooked project also requires enlarging.)However, if you are unsure of rotary cutting, proper pressing, cutting binding, sewing the binding to the quilt top, making a quilt sandwich, and in general all the techniques needed for finishing a quilt... you will need an additional resource. Currently, Amazon is not allowing the insertion of product links within reviews that contain photos, so I'm linking two resources I have used to help me finish some of my quilts in the Comments to this review: The Quilter's Bible by Linda Clements and Darlene Zimmerman's The Quilter's Edge.Have fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLWQ6S4EGZV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611690927#wasThisHelpful","R3LLWQ6S4EGZV6","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tape worked like a charm attaching accent rugs securely to the linoleum, hard wood, and no pile carpet in my home.  Using this tape eradicated slipping and sliding problems with my rugs.  I was especially impressed that it has kept the accent rugs in my high-traffic carpeted hallway firmly in place these last six months where before using this tape they were constantly ""walking"" out of place and scrunching up. I am even able to run the vacuum over them while they're taped down.  It was easy to attach the tape to the rugs and it was even sticky enough to withstand being pulled up and put back down a couple of times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IEKWIL6TJ4MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I1EHK0#wasThisHelpful","R1IEKWIL6TJ4MO","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barb Adams and Alma Allen showcase the home, “the beloved symbol in American folk art that has been used in samplers, hooked rugs, painting and, of course, quilts” in this wonderful book.  I confess that I’m in love with the designs these two incredibly talented women come up with over and over again.  I now have three of their books and I plan on collecting them all!  Really, if you love the look of the projects in the photos I've attached, you’ll love this book.As with the other two Adams & Allen books I have, Home Sweet Home starts out with a featured quilt, worked up two ways.  One created by Adams, and one by Allen, each putting their own unique stamp on the finished quilt.  I love this because it inspires me to apply my color choices to their design.  The featured quilt is, to me, absolutely gorgeous and would have been enough for me!  The additional ten lovely projects in this book are just icing on the cake.The book is set up by seasons.  In the winter, we are instructed in how to make “Family Tree Ornaments,” which are not quilted but instead use copper tape and a soldering iron to make frames for small family photos.  (Sorry, I wasn't able to scan a photo of this project.) There is also a wool appliqued, 49 x 12-inch “Holiday Table Runner” depicting homes around the block.Spring arrives with “Nosegay for Mother,” a lovely, 85 x 85-inch (queen size) quilt sprinkled with bouquets of spring tulips.  A smaller project for spring; “Sweet Pea” is a charming 28 x 28-inch wall hanging or doll quilt featuring appliqued flowers and vines.  Finishing up the projects for spring are two 20 x 22-inch hooked rugs, displaying homes and tulips.“Summer Stars” an 88 x 88-inch (queen size) quilt, which showcases star blocks surrounded by appliqued vines, and “Old Glory” 92 x 92-inch quilt waving the stars and stripes, are the summer projects.Autumn brings us, ""Autumn Brunch"" a wonderful 42 x 20-inch painted canvas table runner (which I intend to use as a floor cloth) displaying gorgeous sunflowers.  Finishing up the projects, is a quilted version of the painted table runner appropriately named “Sunflower Charms.”  (The photo of this project is spread over two pages so I was unable to scan it.)The quilts in this book are not for beginners.  While the instructions for needle turn applique (using freezer paper), and creating the blocks (for all the quilts) are easy to understand, they assume we know what we’re doing when it comes to cutting, seam allowances, pressing properly, sewing the blocks together, making and sewing on binding, making a quilt sandwich, and finishing the quilt.  Those who are not sure about any of these techniques will probably need further assistance or additional resources covering them.  I have achieved excellent results using The Quilter’s Bible by Linda Clement and The Quilter’s Edge by Darlene Zimmerman.  Also, if you own any other quilting books that include excellent detailed instructions (Fons & Porter’s books come to mind) then you could use them.There are full-size templates for all the applique pieces.  In addition there is a full-size (tear out) placement template for the wool ""Holiday Table Runner"" in the back of the book.The photos, from left to right, are:Barb Adams featured quilt, ""Home Sweet Home""Alma Allen's featured quilt, ""No Place Like Home""""Holiday Table Runner"" by Alma Allen""Nosegay for Mother"" designed by Barb Adams""Sweet Pea"" designed by Barb Adams""Welcome Home"" hooked rugs""Summer Stars"" by Alma Allen""Old Glory"" by Barb Adams""Autumn Brunch"" by Adams & Allen","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QAA5LNTVW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933466049#wasThisHelpful","R28QAA5LNTVW7","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I stumbled across the books by Barb Adams and Alma Allen they immediately became my favorite designers, which feature applique in their quilts.  Applique is my favorite medium and I gravitate toward it almost exclusively.  I wish I'd found Adams & Allen much sooner (and that their books had the Look Inside feature!) because if I had, I wouldn't have purchased many of the other quilt books that are gathering dust on my bookshelf!  I'm including photos scanned from this book to help you see if, like me, you love what these two talented people have to offer.In my mind, quilts are works of art and quilters; artists.  The designs of Barb Adams and Alma Allen are timeless works of art that I would hang on my walls.  I can't say that of every designer.  I might appreciate the artistry of their designs but I wouldn't decorate my home with them.  This is my third book by Adams & Allen and I'm once again in love with the projects they have put forth.  Their style suits me perfectly.  Eventually, I will own all of their books!There are twelve projects packed within this delightful book, beginning with ""Evening Bloom"" and ""Country Rose"" which is the same quilt worked up two ways, as interpreted by Adams and Allen. In the photos I've attached to my review, you will see that the same blocks are used but each have used different fabric and added different borders.  The blocks are 24-inches square, which is a size I particularly love for a couple of reasons: the applique pieces are large/not fiddly and this block size is perfect for making up one block and framing it.  Framing a finished block makes lovely wall art and manageable gifts.Other projects include a bit of cross-stitch; first in a framed alphabet sampler and then in small sachets.  A framed 14 x 17-inch, ""Hexagon Pin Board"" and matching pincushion use charm squares (pre-cut 5-inch squares) and the English paper-piecing method.  A ""Monogrammed Pillowcase"" (shown on the cover) with a cute ruffled edge is made using the cross-stitch alphabet given for the sampler.  ""Vintage Tea Lights"" (also shown on the cover) makes use of small shot glasses or other small glasses to make tea lights from soy wax.  ""Sweet Thing"" is a charming 37 x 44-inch pieced quilt, (no applique used,) made using pre-cut charm squares.  In the 72 x 78-inch appliqued quilt, ""Bachelor Buttons,"" Adams & Allen use red and green fabric to create a stunning quilt that I think is perfect for Christmas.  ""Shooting Stars,"" 85 x 85-inches, done in muted red, creams, and steel blue, would be perfect for the 4th of July.  Done in appliqued wool, the half-circle, 42 x 18-inch, ""Pot of Posies"" table mat will be perfect displayed over a door in my home.  The final project, ""Country Charm,"" is a very cute, pieced (no applique,) 42 x 54-inch ruffled throw.In addition to these twelve beautiful projects there are nine delicious breakfast recipes!  Strawberry Jam, Stuffed French Toast, Date and Walnut Scones, Sausage and Egg Casserole, Swedish Pancakes, Broiled Grapefruit, Cranberry Orange Muffins, Laura Renner's Apple Roll-ups, and Belgian Waffle Bits.  Yum!Each project comes with detailed and comprehensive instructions for everything we need to know to sew each block and the quilt top.  Instructions are given for hand applique using the freezer paper method.  There are full-size templates for the applique pieces and each block has an applique placement diagram.  There are instructions for making the paper-pieced hexagons needed for the pin board and pin cushion.  There are beautiful color photographs of all the finished projects and of each finished square of ""Evening Bloom"" and ""Country Rose.""However, if you are unsure of rotary cutting, proper pressing, cutting binding, sewing the binding to the quilt top, making a quilt sandwich, and in general all the techniques needed for finishing a quilt... you will need an additional resource.

"This was a birthday gift for my tall (6'6"") and thin son.  He asked for this Sasquatch hoodie and when I saw they didn't come in tall sizes, I was sure the sleeves would not be long enough.  I ordered it anyway knowing I could return it if it didn't work out.  I am happy (surprised) to say that it fits him wonderfully.  At his height he has very long arms and the sleeves actually cover his wrists.  The body is slim fitting and the length reaches his hips.  It looks like it was made for tall thin people.  I'm not sure it would fit a person with a huskier build.  The best part is that he loves it and says it's toasty warm.  Mission accomplished!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5Q27QT1DTLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6JFHLU#wasThisHelpful","RV5Q27QT1DTLM","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title, Geese in the Rose Garden, perfectly describes the contents of this book.  Heese gives us twelve different 15-inch quilt blocks featuring six appliqued rose blocks of varying designs and six pieced geese blocks.  She has put all twelve together in a ""sampler"" quilt that has a border, which incorporates both flying geese blocks and an appliqued rose vine.These are the blocks you'll be getting: Rose Wreath, Wild Goose Chase, Rose of Sharon, Fox and Geese, Rambling Rose, Brown Goose, Ohio Rose, Goose Tracks, Rose Cross, Flying Geese, Rose Tree, and Goose in the Pond.For me, my love of this book is not for the featured 64""x80-1/2"" sampler quilt, but for the individual blocks themselves.  I'm inspired to use the blocks in combinations of my own choosing.  I also love the large size of the blocks!  I'm going through a phase right now of working up single blocks, framing them, and giving them as gifts.  I love applique, am drawn to it, and right now, single blocks are what's working for me.  The rose blocks in this book are perfectly suited for my need.In addition to the sampler quilt, there is an example of how we can use a single block, in this case, the Ohio Rose, to create a 54-inch square wall hanging.  We are only limited by our imagination to come up with combinations of blocks and quilt sizes of our own.  Heese informs us that a 4 by 5 block setting will make a twin size quilt.  There is also a pattern for a pillow case edged with a row of flying geese and a sweet pincushion.The directions are clear, illustrated, and easy to follow.  Heese begins by instructing us in how to use needle-turn applique, her favored method.  Also covered are: fabric requirements, general supplies (freezer paper, chalk pencil, silk thread, 1/4"" and 1/2"" bias tape makers), how to over-dye fabric, sashing, and borders.  Basically we are given all the directions we need for completing the quilt top.  Sprinkled throughout are helpful ""Tips"" such as: ""Before starting your applique, it is a good idea to apply Fray Check to all the edges of the block.  This will prevent it from unraveling, keeping the block true to size.""  These tips help ensure a good outcome of the finished blocks.  All the templates are full-size.Just so you're aware, in my opinion, this book is written for someone with general sewing/quilting/applique knowledge. For example, some of the things not covered in this book are: rotary cutting, pressing, binding, and quilting.  If you are not familiar with these things, you may need additional instructions from somewhere else.All in all, I recommend this book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VEAU6X1WMM5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935362100#wasThisHelpful","R3VEAU6X1WMM5J","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are three beautiful quilts and three fun cross stitch patterns in this charming book.  For me, the quilts are the stars of this book.The quilts are whimsical and striking, featuring pieced blocks and oodles of appliqued flowers, bunnies, and butterflies.  These are smaller quilts, measuring 64-inches square, 74-inches square, and 80-inches square but borders, sashing, extra rows and/or blocks could be added to increase their size to fit your needs.  In my opinion, an advanced beginner to intermediate quilter could complete these quilts.""Vermilion"" is the smallest of the quilts, a real beauty in different shades of red set on a cream background.  To my eye, it is the loveliest of the three quilts, but that's because I adore red!  It is stunning!""In My Garden"" is so whimsical and fun!  In this 74x74-inch quilt there are bunnies, flowers, and carrots!  I love the fabric choices Heese made in this quilt as well, utilizing ticking stripe.  The finished blocks for this quilt are 18-inches, which is perfect for making a framed wall hanging (something I've been doing a lot of lately, for gifts.)""Gossamer"" is for the butterfly lover.  The entire 80x80-inch quilt is fluttering with them!  This would be the easiest to enlarge to bed size by adding additional rows.The three cross stitch projects include two framed wall hangings, one of which is a sampler, and a sweet pincushion.The book begins with instructions for needle-turn applique (Heese's favorite method,) a stitch glossary, and bias binding.  The instructions for each project includes details on fabric, cutting, sewing, applique layout diagrams, assembling the quilt, full-size templates, and finishing the quilt.  If you're not sure how to make a quilt sandwich, quilt the finished top, or sew binding to your quilt; you may need additional instruction.  Sprinkled within the pages are ""Tips"" giving helpful techniques Heese used on the various projects.Happy Stitching!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8ZFMUMPI6RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935362569#wasThisHelpful","R1J8ZFMUMPI6RB","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book for the cover project. I hoped to find additional projects inside that tickled my fancy but alas, the cover quilt, its accompanying pillow and pillow case are all that I will make from this book.If you're looking for a quilt and matching pillows featuring bullfrogs on lily pads, then you will love this book! There is also a table runner with ladybugs and matching placemats, a wall hanging with posies and butterflies, and a cute pajama bag. The two bed-sized quilts are twin sized but could be enlarged if you need something bigger.Each individual project has detailed, clearly written, and illustrated instructions. In addition, the back of the book has comprehensive General Instructions, which cover: Fabrics (selecting and preparing), Rotary Cutting, Piecing (sewing strip sets, sewing across seam intersections and sewing sharp points), Pressing, Applique (preparing fusible applique pieces, and machine blanket stitch), Quilting (in the ditch quilting, outline quilting, motif quilting, echo quilting, channel quilting, crosshatch quilting, meandering quilting, stipple quilting, marking quilting lines, preparing the backing, choosing batting, assembling the quilt, and machine quilting methods), Making a Hanging Sleeve, Binding, and Signing and Dating Your Quilt.All in all, I recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6ESGFUGBRRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601402643#wasThisHelpful","R2F6ESGFUGBRRI","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are six stunning projects in this wonderful book.  Five of the six include or feature applique in some form.  Since I love applique, the projects in this book are right up my alley. I also love the 19th century look of these quilts.  The colorways that Heese has chosen give these projects an old-fashioned and almost primitive look.In four of the projects, Heese has used the timeless block designs, Harrison Rose, Rose Tree, Snowball, and Coxcomb & Currants.  In addition she gives us a beautiful sampler quilt featuring nine wreath styled blocks.  There is also a strip style quilt using simple four and nine patch squares, a churn dash block, set on point, with wide sashing. All of the quilts are lovely to my eye but my favorites are Rose Tree, Harrison Rose, and Coxcomb & Currants.One of my first projects will be making one of the 18"" square Harrison Rose blocks and framing it as wall art.  This block is a perfect stand-alone project as it features an urn filled with flowers.  Working up a single large sized block like this and framing it makes an absolutely gorgeous gift!The quilts are all throw-size, ranging from the smallest at 50-inches square to the largest at 70-inches square.  I love these smaller sizes because I feel I can complete them much faster than a huge bed-sized quilt.  I am much more likely to finish a smallish project.  For some reason, I feel overwhelmed by the huge projects.  However, if you want a larger quilt you can easily add squares to the existing projects.The book begins with instructions for applique; needleturn, fusible web, and wool.  Heese leaves it up to us on which type of applique we want to use.  If you've never appliqued with wool before, you will love it!  It is by far the easiest medium to use when it comes to applique.  I love how it doesn't fray and gives such a beautiful three-dimensional look to the finished project.Additional detailed, easy to understand instructions with materials list are given for each individual project. Everything we need to know to replicate each project is given.  The applique templates are full-size so no enlarging is necessary.I recommend this book to anyone who loves applique and designs from the past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9G5BK9B0EAZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611690587#wasThisHelpful","R9G5BK9B0EAZ4","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are nineteen vintage looking projects within this delightful book. If you find the cover projects charming then those not shown should appeal to you as well.  Inside you will find an assortment of boxes, bags, purses, and cases you can make to store all kinds of important things: makeup, jewelry, coins, glasses, mobile phones, a sewing kit, and even bread!The book begins with eight pages of good illustrated instructions outlining: materials & tools, techniques & handy tips, and simple embroidery stitches. If you don't already have them, the tools needed are easily obtained in any good craft store: fabric glue, scissors, quilting thread, embroidery floss, various needles and pins, small bulldog or other binding clips, an iron, and while a sewing machine is useful it is not necessary. I've also seen purse frames in my local craft stores but I notice that Amazon sells them as well. In addition to fabric, also needed is batting, and fusible interfacing. Also, an assortment of decorative embellishments are a necessity, such as: charms, buttons, lace, and ribbon to personalize each project. Really, one can let their imagination run wild and doll up any of the projects to suit the recipient's individual taste. A plus is that the pattern templates are full sized, so no enlarging is required.I bought this book because I am always looking for neat ideas for handmade gifts. The projects in this book are right up my alley!

"It was on her porch that Lynda Hall drew inspiration for the design of the 77""x78"" sampler quilt, A Little Porch Time.  As she sat in her rocking chair, sipping her morning coffee, she looked around and what she saw found a place in this quilt. There's the old watering can with the extra long spout, happy sunflowers, fluttering butterflies, a basket or two, birds flitting here and there, a bee skep, leafy vines, and Lynda's kitty, Topaz, also has a place of honor on the quilt. The mostly wool, appliqued shapes are affixed to a patchwork background of homespun plaids, stripes, and checks.  One of my favorite blocks displays two little hands and then one large hand holding a heart.  Lynda explains this block thus, ""The larger hand, down in the left hand corner is mine and the smaller ones represent our little girls, Rebecca and Sarah, our granddaughters.  I'm holding their hearts in my hand just like a gramma should.""In addition to the large sampler quilt, there are four other smaller projects using the items found in the sampler. In the 14""x20"" wool table rug, we see a perky bird perched atop the bee skep, and flanked by flowers.  ""Flower Bucket"" is the name of the 36""x24"" fabric and wool wall hanging/table rug.  On it is the long-spouted watering can with a profusion of primitive posies spilling from it, and three black birds.  Topaz's image is featured in her own individual 17""x22"" table rug/wall hanging in ""Catnip.""  She is standing proudly, among tall flowers, and with a friendly bird perched on her tail.  ""Auntie Bean's Pin Cushion"" a 7"" sunflower, rounds out the projects.There are a couple of pages of general sewing tips/instructions, which covers: fabric applique, wool applique, choosing colors, using the templates, cutting wool, and a discussion of threads to use with Hall's recommendations.  Each project has step-by-step instructions and materials lists. The full-size templates are in the back of the book.It is a darned shame that the Look Inside feature is not available for this lovely book.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves the Primitive look.UPDATE: 3/4/2015  I have added photos of the projects from this charming book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLR9E3JYW0HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935362410#wasThisHelpful","RKLR9E3JYW0HL","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book because I love the afghan on the cover.  Unfortunately, the Look Inside feature, only shows one other of the five total projects.  In addition to the cover afghan, I fell in love with one other project, a beauty done in ivory with one crocodile border row in deep red.  I predominantly crochet gifts for others but this afghan will be for me.The skill level required for the cover afghan, 40 inches square, is for the advanced crocheter, while the remaining four are all listed as intermediate. The 35""x42"" baby quilt looks very similar to the cover, with its flower like motifs, and crocodile border. The Crazy Crocodile afghan, shown in Look Inside, measures 36""x48"" and the Dragonslayer, worked up in panels, measures 48""x64"".  My personal favorite, named Westphalia, is 48""x60"".Each pattern includes diagrams for special stitches used in that afghan.  At the back of the book, there is a stitch guide, but a more helpful option, is the website listed on the cover and throughout the book.

"The holiday motifs in this book are sweet and whimsical and cover winter, Christmas, Nutcracker, Christmas characters, New Year, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter & spring, 4th of July & summer, Halloween, Dia de los Muertos, Thanksgiving, and Hannukkah.  Included also are phrases, borders, animals, trees, and Candyland motifs.  The ultra wonderful thing is that all of these cute motifs are on a CD, which makes printing and sizing super easy to do.The Look Inside feature, unfortunately doesn't completely show all of the 21 sweet, primarily Christmas-themed projects in the book, which to me is a shame because they're so cute. I think the fun thing about this book is that we can substitute any of the other holiday motifs and immediately turn the Christmas projects into whatever holiday we choose.  The projects in this book inspired me to think of my own uses for each motif.  Aimee Ray warns us, in the introduction, that doodle stitching can become addictive, and boy, is she right!The projects are: Elf coasters, Peace Joy Love Advent calendar, Jolly Holidays Mini Wreath, Penguin Stocking Ornaments, Frolicking Foxes Lap Quilt, Soft Nativity, Winter Wonderland Stocking, Felt Star Tree Topper, Autumn to Winter Placemats, Prancer Pillow, Sleepy Mouse Pillowcase, Snowflake Slippers, Let It Snow Garland, Felt Winter Village, Winter Woods Miniature Tree Skirt, Noel Wall Hanging, Plush Vintage Ornaments, Peace on Earth Card & Gift Tag, Fabric Gift Wrap, Teashop Teapot Cozy, and Gingerbread Bookmarks.The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The good thing about doodle stitching is it's so affordable.  It's a brilliant way to personalize and turn a plain ready-made item into a special one-of-a-kind gift using just a needle and a bit of embroidery floss.  My one tip to add to all that Ray includes in this great book, is the use of freezer paper to stabilize the fabric onto which you're transferring your motif when using the tracing method.  I cut a piece of freezer paper, a bit larger than the motif to be traced, and iron it to the back of the stitching fabric.  This holds the fabric straight and stiff while I'm tracing the design.  It makes a huge difference when tracing larger patterns.I love this book and highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FH6HMJUSTQFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145470859X#wasThisHelpful","R1FH6HMJUSTQFK","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This great book contains all the instruction needed to make beautiful rag rugs for every room in your home.  There are ovals, rectangles, hearts, and a few made from simple blocks sewn together.  On some of the projects fringe is added and on others, borders.  The best part?  They're all easy to make, easy enough for beginners, using single and double crochet, and a Q hook.McNeill spends a few pages at the beginning of the book to give a brief history of rug-making, which is followed by ""Basic Tips"" where all we need to know about: materials used/needed, cutting or tearing strips, different methods for joining the fabric strips, single crochet, double crochet, slip stitch, changing colors, and the finished edge is outlined and illustrated.  The Look Inside feature shows a bit of each of the 16 projects in the book.I grew up watching my mom crochet rag rugs using old clothing.  She painstakingly removed buttons, zippers, sewed together the cut strips, and then crocheted throughout the winter months.  Toward the end of her life, I tried to teach her to join her strips using the slit method, which I thought was easier than sewing the strips together, but she'd have none of it.  She did it the way she had always done.  Whichever way you choose to join your strips, whether you use yardage of fabric, recycled clothing, or old sheets to make your rugs, the instructions within this book will see you to the end of a beautiful finished product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UZV9IKDSOY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1574219189#wasThisHelpful","R27UZV9IKDSOY5","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long loved the beauty of Aran knitting and lamented the fact that I am not a knitter.  I've crocheted for over 40 years and it's what I'm comfortable doing.  Bonnie Barker shares in the introduction to this fabulous book that her love for these stitches led her to put together these spectacularly beautiful patterns.  I am so happy she did, because I love this book.  So much in fact, that I'm buying another copy to give to my sister for Christmas.Right away Bonnie reassures the reader not to ""run away screaming in fear from any perceived difficulty in any of these projects.""  The Aran stitches all use the basic chain, single, half-double, double, and treble crochet.  We are taught, in step-by-step photographs, how to combine these fundamental stitches to create the Arrow, Baby Feet Toe Popcorn, Basket Weave, Big Toe Popcorn, Braided Cable, Cable, Celtic Cross, Celtic Weave, Diamond, Honeycomb, Knurl (Reverse Single Crochet), Shadow Box, Shell With Picot, Wheat, and Woven stitches. The photographed instructions also include all the basic stitches and how to make fringe.  If we get stuck, we can access Bonnie's website for step-by-step instructional videos.Each project is given a degree of difficulty, starting with Easy and increasing up to Experienced, the difficulty rating is determined by the amount of specialized stitches used in the project, the more stitches, the more difficult the rating. Bonnie recommends starting with the easier patterns, such as a scarf, and then moving on to the more advanced as we become more confident.  Practice, practice, practice.I particularly liked how we are given the exact yarns used in each project.  A lot of the time, I really love the color or texture of a particular yarn used in the model, and am frustrated because I don't know what it is. Of course, we don't have to use the exact yarn shown in the projects, we can substitute another brand, by weight, and making certain it meets the gauge requirements.  Some of the projects use #4 Fine, DK #3, #4 Worsted, and Bulky #5.  While the cover photo shows the use of the typical Aran color, other projects, throughout the book are done in a variety of colors. In the Resources Guide, at the back of the book, the websites are given for each of the yarn companies that supplied yarn used in the book.Of the projects there are shawls, baby blankets, purse, backpack, carryall bag, afghans, scarves, headband, sweaters, vests, covers for MP3, iPad, cell phone, and even a pillow cover.Sprinkled throughout the book are a half dozen, or so, photos of the drop-dead gorgeous Irish landscape. I'd love to see Ireland in person, but for now I'll look at the photos and dream, while I'm crocheting the patterns in this book.If Bonnie Barker puts out any future Aran crochet pattern designs...I'll be all over it!  I highly recommend this masterpiece. Happy stitching!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RLC6H1MD4V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440238618#wasThisHelpful","R20RLC6H1MD4V6","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm hooked on Crabapple Hill's style!  I love this sweet flower pot design.  When completed, the tea towels made from this pattern are absolutely charming.  The colors are bright and cheerful, and their old-fashioned look really dresses up my farm-style kitchen. I have gone on to make several towels for gifts.  In gift giving, I changed the day of the week inside the little tag to the name of the recipient.  Wrap a homemade goodie in one of these towels and you have a spectacular gift that keeps on giving after the sweet treat has been eaten.The embroidery is quite easy, utilizing the stem stitch, or instead you could use a back stitch, and the French knot.  The pattern does not come with an iron-on transfer.  Instead, you'll trace it onto your towel, using a .01 brown Micron Pigma Pen. If you do not have this pen, you can substitute another fabric safe pen.  To aid you in transferring your pattern, it is suggested that you use a bit of freezer paper, ironed to the back of the towel, to stabilize it.  If you've never used this freezer paper method before, you will love it!  A #7 or #8 embroidery needle is recommended.  I used Aunt Martha's Flour Sack Dish Towels and they work great.  If you use flour sack towels, I very much recommend that you iron them well using starch.  Doing such, makes embroidering so much easier.  Floss requirements are DMC brand and requires 15 colors to complete all seven patterns. For the fabric embellishment, only an 8-inch square is needed for each towel.I purchased this Crabapple Hill pattern (and lots of others) from their website.  I wish I'd known Amazon carried these patterns!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIV02GE7HC3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018N9SFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VIV02GE7HC3Y","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me warn you up front, this series is not for the faint of heart.  The subject matter covered is rape, kidnapping, and murder.  There were brutal and emotional images of beatings and one murder.  I found myself cringing and holding my breath.  In fact, the last time I was so emotionally affected by a program was during my viewing of Broadchurch.  Happy Valley took me hostage for six hours where I could not take my eyes from the screen.  When the final credits rolled I felt emotionally drained but at least I could breathe freely again.  This is not a series where I will rewatch the episodes over (and sometimes over again depending on the series).Sarah Lancashire, (The Paradise, Last Tango in Halifax) gives a stunning performance as Police Sergeant Catherine Cawood, a tough and hardened copper who's given up her life as a detective because of family matters.  And that is putting her situation mildly.  Lancashire has won my respect with her considerable talent amply displayed in this role.  I kept thinking to myself, wow!We are introduced to Catherine at the scene of a threatened suicide-by-petrol taking place in a playground.  Cawood arrives with a borrowed fire extinguisher in hand and when the high as a kite young man begins telling her his reason for setting himself alight, (his girlfriend has broken up with him), she replies, ""I'm Catherine, by the way!  I'm forty-seven, I'm divorced, I live with my sister, who's a recovering heroin addict, I have two grown-up children. One dead and one who doesn't speak to me. And a grandson! So.""As the story unfolds from there, we learn the details behind Catherine's statement.  Little by little, over six episodes, we see why Catherine's husband divorced her, how her daughter died, why her son doesn't speak to her, why her sister lives with her, and how she came to have custody of her eight year-old grandson.  Catherine's story is incredible and her strength is admirable and inestimable.  I found myself admiring her immensely and feeling intense sorrow for her at the same time.  This story touched me deeply.I do not want to go into details of the story because I don't want to ruin one minute of this program for you.  I will tell you as much as the video case reveals.  Kevin Weatherill, played by Steve Pemberton (Whitechappel,) instigates the kidnapping of his boss' daughter, Ann, when he becomes bitterly angry about being turned down for a rise in pay. The man to whom he suggests the abduction, Ashley Cowgill, is someone he trusts not to harm the girl. However, Kevin has no idea who and what Ashley is nor does he know that in Ashley's employ is one Tommy Lee Royce, just out of prison for drugs crimes, and believed to be responsible for the death of Catherine's daughter.  Royce is cruel and his involvement in the kidnapping sends everything spiraling out of control.  Kevin and Ashley are out of their depth.  Catherine, knowing that Royce is out of prison on her patch, will not rest until justice for her daughter prevails, even if that means taking matters into her own hands.  Let's just say that things get messy.Catherine's life is filled with personal and professional trials.  Her grandson is disrespectful, slinging insults at his gran that made me want to send him to his room, and constantly in trouble at school. His behavior causes Catherine to question if she is doing right by him.  Her ex-husband has remarried and has nothing to do with their grandson but still pursues Catherine for dinner and more.  Why?  She is haunted by the image of her daughter's disfigured and dead body.  Why?  I liked how I kept looking for the answers to the why's.  In addition, as the sergeant of Happy Valley's police force, Catherine's job is a stressful one, to say the least.  Even so, she slogs along day by day as more and more is heaped upon her.Clare, Catherine's sister, quietly and masterfully portrayed by Siobhan Finneran, plays a huge and pivotal role in Catherine's life.  I found myself hoping for more back story about the two sisters.  I wondered what their childhood was like and about the life events, which shaped them.This series is one story shown over six episodes.  There is no murder mystery to be solved.  We know who is doing what but we don't always know why.  I particularly liked how plot points were doled out bit by bit so I had several ah-hah moments.  I found myself analyzing all the characters and looking for their motivation at every turn.  I loved this!I was also wowed by Catherine's capable handling of hooligans.  She was fearless in facing violence and dished out a bit of her own when the situation called for it.  And the situation called for it more than once.  I couldn't help but pull for her throughout the episodes and almost pray that everything would turn out for the best for her.  I wanted a happy ending for Happy Valley in the worst way.  I guess a happy ending is in the eye of the beholder.All in all, I was completely taken in by this program and while at times the brutality sucked the breath out of me, I was enthralled and compelled to go the distance.  I want to see more of Catherine Cawood.  I hope there are further seasons in this series.There are subtitles, which is immensely helpful, even for those with an ear for the strong accents of Great Britain.  The brogue is thick and spoken quickly.Edited: 8/28/2014 Folks, this series is now on Netflix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLWVU3XVJZ2YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRXHEAA#wasThisHelpful","RLWVU3XVJZ2YP","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my constant search for series in this genre, I stumbled across this gem on Amazon UK.  When I saw it was based upon the writing of Ann Cleeves, (Vera,) I snapped it up.  While I have never read Cleeves' books her stories as portrayed in these two adaptations really appeal to me.  I love Vera and now I love Shetland.Shetland, like Vera, is character centric.  In Shetland, our focus is upon the head of CID, Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez, portrayed by Douglas Henshall, (Collision, Primeval,) a widower with custody of his beautiful teenage step-daughter, Cassie.  He moved away from the Islands, where he grew up, but on the death of his wife, he returned to Lerwick, where they met and fell in love.  He feels close to her there and wants Cassie to know the place and people from where her mother came.Inspector Perez appealed to me as a main character because he's a good man, with a hard job, navigating through an even harder time in his life.  I am a huge fan of crime fighters/sleuths being good people.  Perez is good, as well as smart, shrewd, intuitive, moral, and fair.  As he deals with the survivors and family members of the dead, witnesses, and suspects he does it with kindness, sensitivity, and respect.  He is soft spoken but direct.Cleeves' deft hand is clearly seen in the main character closely watching people with the ability to look deeply inside of them and see more than they wish to reveal.  Jimmy's interactions with his step-daughter's biological father had me approving of him even more.  Perez is a good dad.  Henshall fills the role perfectly.  His portrayal was spot on with no slippage in character.  He was always believable.The crew that surrounds and aids Perez are perfectly suited to him.  While his Police Sergeant, Billy McCabe (Lewis Howden) is older and wiser, the other two officers who help him do the legwork involved in murder investigation are young and inexperienced.  Still, what they lack in experience, they more than make up for in enthusiasm and determination. PC Sandy Wilson (Steven Robertson), is dreaming of and studying to become a detective. Sandy displays maturity and emotional fortitude in the face of familial loss. Rounding out the crew is DC Alison ""Tosh"" MacIntosh (Alison O'Donnell).  Her forensic skills and quick mind aid Perez in surprising ways. All three are Shetland Island locals having lived there their entire lives.  They know the land and better yet, they know the people.  This gives them insight and awareness of the goings on and proves, at times, to be invaluable in solving the murders that devastate the small, close-knit community. Unfortunately, and sadly, this means they also know and in some cases, love the victims... and the murderers.Sandy and Tosh, while young, are sharp and eager to learn the craft of murder solving.  I liked that they were aware and appreciative of Perez's obvious abilities.  Also they respected him, but then he's a man who earns respect.  Formerly a detective in Glasgow, he brings an impressive resume, experience, and skill to Lerwick.  Jimmy Perez is an excellent role model for the aspiring detectives on his team.  I liked how he lead by example.  A visiting forensic officer from the big city of Inverness said to him, ""You know you're wasted here.""  Oh, no he is not!  He's right where he's supposed to be.The Shetland Islands of Northeast Scotland are stark in their harsh beauty.  I was completely captivated by the windswept land, gray churning ocean, and hovering clouds.  The often gloomy appearing landscape seemed the perfect setting for tragic death by murder.  The locale haunted me and I found myself yearning to go there and experience it for myself.  The Scottish dialect can be difficult to understand but I found it lyrical and charming.  There are subtitles so nothing is lost to our listening ears.In addition to the beautiful scenery I was struck by the haunting Celtic theme music.  It set the mood of sadness, which accompanies death, perfectly.  In the credits, the only reference to the music was the composer, John Lunn.  I would love to have the soundtrack...if one were available.There are four episodes, based upon the best-selling books, Red Bones, Raven Black, Dead Water, and Blue Lightning.  Each contain murder, compelling characters, and surprise endings.  I loved pitting my crime solving wits against the culprits' and adding my will to Perez and his team's efforts to find and bring the murderer(s) to justice.I highly recommend this series.  If you have not yet seen Vera you are missing out.  Recently released in the UK is Vera 4, another masterpiece of murder.As noted in the product description, this set is Non-USA format and requires a multi-region DVD player and compatible television to play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0P6DDZ7AQM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUFCPPC#wasThisHelpful","R1R0P6DDZ7AQM0","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quilting Quickly contains 13 projects we can whip up in a jiffy by making use of pre-cut fabric (the greatest invention in fabric since the fat quarter.) However, if you have a large stash of fabric you can easily substitute your scraps for the pre-cuts.The projects range in difficulty from Beginner, to Easy, to Intermediate.  The eleven quilts range in size from wall (or crib) size, to twin size, and in-between.  A table-topper and pillow sham round out the total projects.I really liked the feature of 'Video' sprinkled throughout the book whereupon we can visit the Fons & Porter website to access video tutorials for the projects.  It's worth checking out their website for these.The instructions are detailed and comprehensive.  All templates are full sized so no enlarging is needed.  Also, in the back of the book you'll find a primer on pre-cuts and a cool feature called Quilt Classroom.  In this classroom, instructions are given for: How to identify straight grain and selveges, making an ironing pad, making triangle squares, free-motion quilting, binding by machine, and using the Fons and Porter Binding Tool.  Video tutorials are available online for each of these classroom topics.If you aren't familiar with the Best Of series by Fons & Porter... these are a few of my favorites:The Best of Fons & Porter: Tabletop QuiltsBest of Fons & Porter: Favorite QuiltsBest of Fons & Porter Kickin' Back Quilts","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HL2ZUTEWU26A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464714886#wasThisHelpful","R1HL2ZUTEWU26A","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to quilting books, I trust Fons & Porter.  I have never been disappointed in any of their ""Best Of"" books and Kickin' Back Quilts is another hit with me.In this collection of 25 quilts, all are lap or wall-hanging size ranging in difficulty from easy, intermediate, and one challenging; the majority (14) being easy. All are scrappy and will work well for using up our stash.  There are size options for increasing to twin, queen, and king for several of the designs.The quilts are beautiful and would make wonderful gifts.  I'm writing this review in June but I'm sure Christmas will appear...tomorrow!As is usual in Fons & Porter books, the instructions are clear, comprehensive and concise.  Additionally, scattered throughout are 'Sew Easy' pages outlining various techniques used in one quilt or another. Examples of these are: Quick Triangle Squares, Making Tilted Blocks, Cutting Half-Square and Quarter-Square Triangles, Set-In Seems, and Freezer Paper Templates.  Everything that needs to be known about creating a quilt from basic supplies to binding is in the back of the book with color photos.I also liked the feature 'Web Extra' whereupon we can visit the Fons & Porter website for additional video tutorials on various techniques.The templates are all full size so no enlarging required.I highly recommend this book!

"I bought the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post for my son's cat, Rogue, and I love it.  I thought the height of the post would be perfect for him to sit upon and look out of the window, if only there were a perch on top of it.  I was elated to find that I could get one!As soon as the package arrived, I quickly opened it and easily slid the perch on top of the post.  I placed the post strategically in front of the window looking out over the garden; hoisted Rogue atop the perch and eagerly watched to see his happiness at having a spot to look out at the birds.He stayed there for about 10 seconds, long enough to look at me, with a look of disdain, as if to say...""Hey! I can't even lie down on this itty bitty thing!"" and then he jumped down.  He has never once jumped up on the darned thing.  I've put him on it every day since we got it but he just isn't interested. In case you're wondering Rogue measures 20-inches from his nose to the beginning of his tail. He doesn't seem overly large to me.  Measure your cat to be sure they'll be able to enjoy this perch.  It's such an excellent idea. I wish it were bigger.This product is well made.  The cover is removable and washable.  I believe that if this perch were bigger...it would be the cat's meow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5BET80M82D8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XJ9PYA#wasThisHelpful","R5BET80M82D8M","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happened upon this bottle with pourer quite by accident.  It caught my eye because I love its shape.  I bought it for its looks but after using it the design has a purpose.  Grasping and pouring/drizzling is comfortable. The green tint of the bottle was icing on the cake for me.  I would still have bought it in clear glass but I prefer that it's tinted.  I like the convenience of leaving the oil out on the counter near my range and the beauty of this bottle is much preferable to the oil's original container.The stopper/pourer fits snugly but removes easily enough for cleaning and adding more oil to the bottle.During a move, I lost my previous bottle with pourer that I used for olive oil.  Since then I've been pouring it straight from the bottle in which I buy it.  This works fine for putting oil in the pan but is not ideal for drizzling oil directly onto salad or other foods.  Certainly, holding my thumb over the bottle's opening restricts the flow and I would have been okay with continuing in this manner if I hadn't had a pourer in the past.  Having a pourer spoiled me.All in all, this bottle/pourer is perfect for me and I highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKSYKWU74PNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUTCOJ0#wasThisHelpful","RDKSYKWU74PNR","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my ever-constant search for inspirational applique, I stumbled across this gem.  It is a crying shame that we are not given the option to Look Inside this book.  UPDATE 3/5/15  Photos added.Adams, Allen, and Creamer have put together designs for 12 projects in this book.  The book begins with an 84x84-inch Feature Quilt by Adams & Allen worked up in two different colorways.  Each block uses applique to showcase blooms found throughout the garden.  The blocks feature these flowers spilling from various baskets, vases, and pitchers.  One thing I love about the blocks is that they measure 20 inches square.  I love this because the larger size makes these blocks so versatile.  For example, I can use an individual block as a pillow front or a wall hanging. This makes for a manageable project for gift giving, for which I'm always looking.  Another plus to the block size is how quickly a project will work up and the applique pieces are of a nice size; not small and fiddly.The blocks are broken down by seasonal blooms.  Seasons are also depicted in the color choices used.  The two winter blocks features poinsettia, holly leaves, berries, and amaryllis. In the two blocks for spring; bleeding hearts, peonies, pansies, and tulips.  There are three blocks for summer featuring; geraniums, and summer herbs (rosemary, dwarf myrtle.) The third summer block varies from using a container, there is instead, a delightful depiction of an English cottage surrounded by a riotous English garden. (This is my favorite block.)  The two blocks of Autumn feature; cone flowers, cockscomb, oak leaves, and acorns.  In each of the blocks we also see vines, leaves, stars, bees, and a butterfly or two.A delightful bonus to this amazing book is that each quilt block is accompanied by a beautiful photo of a container garden and instructions for planting it!  This is absolutely wonderful for me as I am not a gardener but I want to be one!The eleven additional projects include: a sheet set & pillow shams; a top sheet & pillow; seasonal purses using even more applique designs; a 29½-inch square quilt featuring stars and tulips; a 68-inch by 85-inch quilt using patchwork (no applique in this quilt); a 44-inch square quilt using applique and patchwork blocks of stars and butterflies; an 8x8-inch hooked rug of a cottage; 4½-inch square needle-punch vase of flowers; 10-inch square red-work pillows embroidered using a stem stitch; a 64x64-inch quilt of appliqued containers of blooms; and a 70x70-inch Christmas quilt featuring containers of poinsettia, holly, and berries.As to instructions and templates: the instructions are clear and comprehensive. There is a section of specific instruction on turned edge hand applique using freezer paper.  Instructions for specific techniques are included with each project using them.  The applique templates are full size so no enlargement is necessary there.  However, the applique placement diagrams for the seasonal blocks do require enlargement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BMAH43DXFQTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975480413#wasThisHelpful","R2BMAH43DXFQTF","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kim Diehl once again delivers on her signature style of patchwork complimented by applique in quiltmaking.  I love applique mixed with patchwork and her designs really appeal to my personal aesthetic. I love the high contrast mix of fabrics she uses in many of her designs.  I love her color choices of deep and dark: red, gold, tan, green, blue, brown, and black.  However, the pink, turquoise, purple, and soft green in the cover quilt, ""Late Bloomers"" has really grown on me! I'm already imagining how I can incorporate these beautiful hues in other projects.I love Kim's books because the projects she designs are beautiful, many include applique, they always have great instructions, and the finished product is accomplishable and a treasured keepsake.  She combines traditional patchwork squares with her own style of appliqued flowers and pennies to bring us her personal design sensibility.The 14 projects range in size from two twin bed sized, seven wall hangings from 13½-inches square to 76½-inches square, two table toppers, and a framed 8½x11-inch mini quilt.  There is also a pincushion. The quilt designs include patterns familiar to quilters such as log cabin, nine patch, four patch, and half-triangles.  In several of her projects, Diehl uses wool in her applique.The step-by-step instructions accompanying each design are comprehensive and easy to understand.Scattered throughout the pages are ""Pin Point"" boxes, which offer added tips and information to instruct; I particularly found Kim's suggestion of using a clear plastic over-the-door shoe organizer to keep fat quarter and fat eighths corralled a creative idea. There are many more pin point suggestions to aid us in our quilting pursuits.At the back of the book, is Quiltmaking Basics, which includes: Yardage Requirements, Rotary Cutting, Cutting Bias Strips, Pinning, Machine Piecing, Chain Piecing, Pressing Seams, Pressing Triangle Units, Invisible Machine Applique, Preparing Pattern Templates, Making Bias-Tube Stems and Vines, Basting Appliques, Preparing Your Sewing Machine, Stitching Appliques, String Applique, Removing Paper Pattern Pieces, Completely the Machine Applique Process, Wool Applique, Felting Your Wool, Preparing Wool Appliques, Stitching Wool Appliques, Completing the Quilt Top, Adding Borders, Batting, Backing, Basting, Marking Quilting Designs, Hand Quilting, Big Stitch Quilting, Machine Quilting, Binding, and Attaching a Quilt Label.For me, this is a must have Kim Diehl book of designs.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who loves beautiful quilts and the work of Kim Diehl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16K70CD2YX3T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604682973#wasThisHelpful","R16K70CD2YX3T0","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right before Christmas I began crocheting cowls, hats, scarves, and hooded cowls for Christmas gifts using Lion Brand Thick and Quick Yarn in various colors.  A friend of mine is a hunter and I wanted safety orange for his cowl but I could not find a bright orange in Thick and Quick.I am so pleased to have found this orange in the Hometown yarn.  There are several colors from which to choose.  It works up just as quickly as Thick and Quick, is extremely soft and comfortable next to the skin, and is warm.  I did not encounter any knots and splitting was not a problem. The color stays fast when washed. Projects work up fast; I can complete a cowl in three hours.

"Lately, I've been crocheting daily.  Crocheting relaxes me and I feel a sense of accomplishment by creating beautiful things while sitting on my behind.  I have always used Boye hooks and the embossed printing upon their hooks make my thumb sore.  I have groused over what I consider a ""design flaw"" of Boye hooks for a long time.  I've covered the printing with tape, band-aids, worn band-aids on my thumb, and tried other cushioning fixes including sponge hook and pen covers.  None of my homemade fixes have been satisfactory.In addition to the issue with my thumb the palm of my hand gets sore where I rest the end of the hook. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but the friction of the hook irritates my skin.When I saw these Clover hooks with the cushioned grip I swooned at the possibility of being able to crochet in comfort.  Within minutes of using these hooks I could feel the difference.  Ooh! Ah! The soft and padded handle is perfect for the way I hold the hook.  One side is flat, where my thumb rests, and the opposite is slightly rounded.  No need for homemade cushions any longer!  The padding also protects the palm of my hand and there is no friction from the hook moving across my skin.  I'm in love!If you are used to crocheting with Boye hooks, the Clover hooks will be an easy transition for you.  I have not noticed any difference in that regard with these hooks.I'm so happy I bought these hooks, so much so that I'm going to get a set for my sister for her birthday!

"This is a great beginner pattern for really cute slippers.  The stitches are simple: chain, single crochet, slip stitch, half double crochet, and two single crochets together.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow and there are accompanying photos showing how to work two single crochets together to decrease.  Because these sweet slippers are so simple to make; they can be whipped up quickly.  This simplicity makes this pattern perfect for giving these slippers for gifts.  I love the sweet pearl beads that decorate the buttons but my imagination is running wild imagining substitutions for the pearls to further individualize and personalize the slippers for each person on my gift list.The pattern is written for UK size 5, which is European size 38, and US size 6.  In parentheses sizes 7, 8, and 9 are given.  If you want to make any larger sizes, Medoza explains that we can add two chains per size increase.To make my slippers non-slip, I dot Dimensional Puffy Fabric Paint to the bottoms of the slippers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GL9T75X2B8NO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BONK21O#wasThisHelpful","R3GL9T75X2B8NO","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this Thermos mug for my husband to keep his morning coffee hot for his 40 minute commute to work and for the coffee he drinks throughout his work day.  His commute is really the longest amount of time he required it to remain hot, at present, he'll also use it when we travel, which are longer trips.  However, the first day he had it, he forgot it in his truck and at the end of his day, ten hours later, he had hot, not warm, hot, coffee to drink on his way home.  We were both happily surprised by this.  We live in the southwest desert so it's not freezing cold here right now but it was cool, in the 30's the day this happened so, we're very pleased.The lid screws in, which is another feature my husband wanted.  It certainly prevents accidents of not getting the lid completely on mugs that the lid pushes on or fits inside the mug.  In addition, the lid top has a twisting mechanism to open a slot for the beverage to flow through.  When open for drinking the word ""OPEN"" is clearly shown, when closed, it says ""CLOSED"".This Thermos tumbler is not dishwasher safe but this doesn't bother me.  I'm purchasing another.

"My dog Boone, is an AKC standard size Shih-Tzu and this stand with bowls fits his height perfectly.  I measured Boone and his mouth is 13-inches from the floor.  The top of the bowl in the stand is 5.5-inches making it so he doesn't have to hunch over to eat and drink.  This is good for his digestion.I love the size of the bowls, especially for water because they hold 24-ounces (three cups.)  I like that they are stoneware for clean-up.  I believe they are dish-washer safe but the bowls don't say they are, and I hand wash them before filling them.  I don't care for plastic (I read that bacteria is prevalent in plastic...true? I don't know, but I'm not chancing it!) and stainless steel bowls aren't cute.  These bowls are extremely cute with the playful puppies cavorting around the edge.  Because the background color is white, it is easy to see if the water is dirty.  Because of Boone's flat face, he is forever getting his water dirty from ""washing"" his face in it! I give him fresh water daily but now that I can see when it's dirty, I change it often throughout the day.The stand is sturdy and not flimsy.  The feet are padded to not only protect the floor from scratches but also from black marks that wrought iron can make on some floors.  I also like that there are four small rubber-like covers over the bowl rings to cushion the bowls.  You'll want to be careful with these as they slip off fairly easily.I highly recommend this product, in fact, I'm going to purchase the kitty sized one for my son as a gift for my grandkitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39PZXQ1F2S9GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPILAC#wasThisHelpful","R39PZXQ1F2S9GG","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was desperate to find an affordable product that would help my long, fine, and flyaway hair to settle down! I recently moved from a humid climate in the southeast to the southwest desert and my hair now snaps, crackles, and pops sending sparks zipping through the air. When you were a kid, did you ever rub a balloon on your hair to produce static electricity, which then caused your hair to stand up?  Well, that is my hair in the desert sans balloon.  Not pretty!  My hair attaches itself to my clothing and floats in the air up around my ears!  I've moisturized and conditioned.  I've applied other products but either of two things happened, after an hour or so my hair would be dancing around my ears again or it was limp and oily looking!  I want silky, soft, shiny, calm, and in its place hair; not oily-limp.  This Argan Oil does the trick on my hair. It is now smooth and shiny!I apply the oil while my hair is still damp after shampooing and conditioning.  I smooth the oil on the ends of my hair from ear level to the tips.  I particularly pay attention to the very ends making sure to apply enough oil to not just tame but treat them.  I don't apply the oil all the way to the scalp on a daily basis.  I do however use this oil once per week on my scalp.  I apply it directly to my scalp, this takes several squirts.  I rub it in well and leave it on while I do things about the house.  Later, I shampoo and condition and then reapply the oil as described above.I also apply this oil on my skin.  Since moving to the desert, I'm about to dry up and blow away with the tumbleweeds!  One morning, after doing my hair I was enjoying the feeling of the oil on the palms of my hands.  So, I pumped a bit more and smoothed it on the back of my hands. Ooh!  I pumped a bit more and smoothed the oil over my forehead.  Ahh!  From then on, I went crazy and dobbed it around my eyes, cheeks, and throat, avoiding the T-zone area.  I love this stuff.  I'm old enough to be past breakouts to my skin so using it thus is not a problem for me.  I also don't apply it to my skin on a daily basis as I have facial moisturizers with sunscreen that I love and use.  However, this argan oil feels marvelous on my skin! It's great on my nails and cuticles.  And you know what else? I've used it on my feet! At first, I just rubbed some in and then I had the brilliant idea, well, I thought it was brilliant, of putting a few pumps in a pan of water, and soaking my feet in it! Ding, ding, winner!This oil smells fabulous!  The fragrance is warm and soft.  It isn't an overpowering, make your eyes water, and your nose sneeze kind of scent.  It's soft and wafting.  Which is a darned good thing since I now am covered in it...head to toe.You might laugh but you know where else I use this amazing oil?  On my dog's fly-away hair! Yes, I do!  Boone is a Shih-Tzu and the hair on his long tail and ears is also acting up and flying around in this desert clime, hey, he can't be walking around looking like that!  I'm a good dog-mother and will not let my little guy be embarrassed in the neighborhood!  This great product works on his hair too!  And he looks, hot!I highly recommend this product if you have a similar need to mine...and Boone's!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GZD974IE1IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6T4U2I#wasThisHelpful","R32GZD974IE1IR","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this 4-piece knife set based upon the recommendation for Victorinox knives in The Complete America's Test Kitchen TV Show Cookbook, 2001-2013.Since their arrival into my kitchen, I've sliced tomatoes, onions, bread, and meat.  I've peeled apples and potatoes.  I've chopped garlic, nuts, carrots, and celery.  Each knife handled their tasks with ease.  The softer Roma tomatoes cut like butter.  I love the handles.  They fit nicely in my hand (medium sized) and the rough surface does not slip. The handles were also large enough that my knuckles did not hit the counter while chopping.

"First, a little bit about what formed my opinion...I love Agatha Christie's books.  I also love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  These two loves have influenced how I feel about the Miss Marple films featuring the talented Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie.  For me, the story is what's important.As much as I love the Hickson versions, I believed there was room for improvement, minor tweaking, freshening up, but by no means rewrites of Christie's work.  All are really showing their age.  I was looking forward to the remakes.  Christie's work is so great that I was excited about having it brought to the high definition era.  I was not disappointed in the appearance of the remakes.  On the other hand, I was not happy with the content changes in most of the remakes.  Some were good, some were okay, and then there were the bad.No matter how hard I try to be objective about these remakes and not make comparisons to the books and the Hickson versions, I find I can't. I found myself watching and muttering things like, ""What?! Miss Marple did not have an adulterous affair!"" About other characters, ""they weren't married, an alcoholic, divorced, the murderer, a Nazi..."" to name but a few.McKenzie is a ""softer"" Miss Marple than Hickson and I like this a lot. She really does shine as Miss Marple.  Where Hickson gave a serious, unsmiling, austere, and flinty portrayal; McKenzie is more approachable, and to me, she added an increased believability of Miss Marple being everyone's Auntie Jane. All in all, I love her as Miss Marple.In Series Six we see the final remake of the Hickson twelve, A Caribbean Mystery.  While there were alterations galore made to the original, the main plot and characters remained the same, these being; Jason Rafael, his secretary, his physical therapist, Major Palgrave, Molly & Tim Kendall, Greg & Lucky Dyson, Edward & Lynne Hillingdon, and Victoria. If you are not familiar with the story, we see Aunt Jane in Barbados.  Her generous nephew, Raymond, has sent her there to aid in her recovery from a bad bout of arthritis. (In the original, she went there for a ""pig of a bronchitis."")  During her stay, a fellow guest suddenly dies.  Jane has reason to believe it is murder but the local Inspector does not.  She enlists the help of fellow guest, Jason Rafael, a self-made multi-millionaire to try and persuade the police otherwise.  The Inspector practically tosses them out of his office as old crackpots.  When another murder takes place, Jane is convinced that unless the killer is identified, even more will die.  With no help from the police, she sets out on her own, to ascertain the culprit.  How many and who will die?The differences between the original and the new that bothered me the most are: 1. The attitude of the Police Inspector; in the original he had heard of Miss Marple through Sir Henry Clithering (once head of CID at the Met,) who said, ""She is the best personality analyst in the world and she has a ruthless forensic brain."" When Jason Rafael informed the Barbados Inspector of her presence upon the island, his response was, ""Magnificent!"" In the new version, the Inspector had no use for Miss Marple or the rich and powerful Rafael.  2. There is no mention of Nemesis!  This is integral.  How could they forget this when the mention of Nemesis in A Caribbean Mystery is the basis for the follow-up titled, Nemesis!  I give, A Caribbean Mystery, three stars even though the filming is absolutely stunning and the supporting cast, as always, is brilliant.Episode Two, Greenshaw's Folly, is not based upon a Marple novel and therefore was completely new to me.  In this offering, Jane comes to the rescue of her ""niece"" Louisa, who is running away from her abusive husband with her young son, Archie.  Auntie Jane finds refuge for them at Greenshaw's Folly, the home of her friend, Katherine Greenshaw, the daughter of the eminent scientist, Decimus Greenshaw.  Luckily for Louisa, Katherine is in need of a secretary.  Louisa can ""hide out"" in Katherine's country home, tagged Greenshaw's Folly by the locals.  The home is shrouded in mystery.  There is a hidden and locked laboratory that holds terrible secrets of Decimus' past. Not long after their arrival, and while Jane is still there, what happens?  Murder.  Yay! It is left to Jane to continue to protect her charges and uncover the killer.  Once again, Jane is on her own while the local Inspector pooh-pooh's all of her ideas and observations.  I loved it; five stars.  Should more Miss Marple films be made, I would be elated if they shadowed Greenshaw's Folly.  I love Jane and I want to see more of her with McKenzie.The final episode, Endless Night, was a fail for me.  It was dark.  It had a film noir feeling and used narration by the main character, an impoverished young man with big dreams of wealth, to tell the story.  Miss Marple is oddly placed within the story.  She would just pop up here and there, into the life of this man.  Ultimately, she was in the story often enough to figure out whodunit when no one else could.  For me, it didn't work.  Everything revolved around this young man, which in and of itself is okay, but what wasn't okay is the way Miss Marple was fitted into the story.  It was not about Miss Marple.  I was also put off by the darker and sinister tone it just wasn't what I was expecting. I give Endless Night two stars.Let's add it up...A Caribbean Mystery was okay, I wish it had followed the story and mentioned Nemesis: 3 stars.  I loved Greenshaw's Folly: 5 stars. Endless Night was a bit ""dark"" for me and Miss Marple's part seemed forced and odd: 2 stars.  Overall, 3.33 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXRGG1R7BKL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWXI2MC#wasThisHelpful","RUXRGG1R7BKL3","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After John Nettles' leaving spear-headed a mass exodus from the program, with the exception of Jason Hughes, I began a period of mourning.  I was more than willing to give the ""new"" MSM with Tom's cousin, John, taking the helm of Causton's CID, a chance.  I was sorry to see Nettles leave but, oh so happy that the series would be continuing.  However, I was not thrilled with Set 21 but believed it would get better when the transition from one Barnaby to the other was complete.  I was totally bummed when Set 22 seemed to be worse; I didn't like it all.  I was disappointed in the storylines.  Well, I was unhappy about a lot of things but I shared those in my review of that set.All this backstory to tell you that I had trepidations about purchasing this set.  In fact, I wasn't going to, I even said I wouldn't, but I did during one night of sleepless boredom.  I'd seen everything!  I needed something to watch to feed my addiction to British mysteries.  In a fit of impulsive desperation I one-click purchased this set. (I definitely need to turn that off!  Note to self: Don't grocery shop when hungry and don't shop Amazon in the middle of the night.)  Guess what happened next? I had buyer's remorse!  When it arrived, I put it aside for about three weeks until again during another sleepless night popped it in the DVD player.  Oh! Bother!  I should have watched it right away.  Miraculously, in my mind it was a miracle, I loved it.  Yippee!  I've pre-ordered Set 24!Set 23, marks a return to the original quirky but not outlandish (like Night of the Stag in Set 22) stories that made the original MSM of old one of my favorite British mystery series.  I loved the humor that once again made its way to the circumstances surrounding the deadly dramas.  There seemed to be a new affable rapport between Barnaby and Jones that was missing in the prior two sets since Neil Dudgeon's appearance.  I also noted a subtle but definite change in how John treated Jones, which gave an appearance of his having more respect for Jones than I saw previously.  All in all, I am very happy with what I see as improvements.I enjoyed the storylines: A headless horseman targeting an aristocratic and country family? Ancient battle recreations? Great!  Murder and mayhem from the movies? Wonderful!  A weird whodunit with twists?  Now you're talking!One indicator, I use in rating films and TV is the ""will I re-watch the episodes"" quotient.  If I will definitely re-watch...five stars.  Maybe...four stars.  Probably not...three stars.  No way...two stars.  If I ""hate"" something, which on Amazon is the one star designation, I usually don't watch the entire film and therefore do not review it.  I will re-watch Midsomer Murders Set 23.  Actually, I'm doing so right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5KNLLY3YLHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHH9I62#wasThisHelpful","R1L5KNLLY3YLHR","A1C70R9KCILEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C70R9KCILEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All the quilts contained in this book can be made without the use of the specialty rulers.  There are actual size templates, which can be used instead. However, if you already own the three rulers used in the Lintotts' designs, they have provided 18 pretty patterns to encourage their use.I loved the designs contained in this book.  I love quilts that use a light background color.  For some reason, they remind me of the quilts from yesteryear made from clothing scraps and flour bags.  These were the types of quilts that adorned the beds of my childhood.  Pam and Nicky, mother and daughter, respectively, bring a modern sensibility to retro (in my view) with whimsy and color choice.  Of course, different colorways can be substituted, if their choices don't suit our tastes.  The quilts shown are all small/throw size, ranging from the smallest at 39""x39"" to the largest, which is 70""x70"".There are six patterns using the Two Peaks in One Ruler, six using the Double-strip Kaleidoscope Ruler, and six more for the Multi-Size Flying Geese & 45/90 Triangle. Creative Grids rulers are shown in this book, but the Lintotts state that other brands can be substituted.Each quilt has detailed instructions and diagrams.  At the back of the book are instructions of general techniques covering: pressing, pinning, chain piecing, removing dog ears, joining border and binding strips, adding borders, quilting, binding, enlarging the quilts, setting on point, and calculating backing fabric.I love this book for the instruction in using these three specialty rulers to make quick and pretty quilts.

"I recently moved into an apartment that does not have washer/dryer hook-ups.  Oh, no! I knew lugging laundry to the laundry room would wreak havoc on my bad back.  What to do?

This cart is sturdy and the wheels roll smoothly over the rocky (cobblestone-like) sidewalk.  I like that it comes with an attached ""roof"" that can cover the contents of the bag.

"Let me start by saying that I've owned the first Silhouette Cameo since it's release and I've since purchased another Cameo. I've had the Cricut Personal cutter, Cricut Expression, and the Brother Scan N Cut. Of all of these machines, the Silhouette Cameo is by far my favorite. I'm VERY familiar with this type of machine and the Silhouette Studio software it uses because it is the same software that the Cameo uses. I ordered this machine because of the things it is supposed to be able to do that the Cameo can't do. I cut vinyl and heat transfer vinyl with my Cameo all the time. It has a larger cutting area and I'm familiar with it, so I have no desire to use the Curio to do that, but the Curio is capable of cutting vinyl and heat transfer vinyl. I tried the embossing function on water color paper and was unimpressed. It just didn't emboss well when embossing alone. It did fair when I scored and embossed. I used the stippling function, a pen holder, and a sharpie marker and it worked ok.  I have no desire to do paper crafts, but only attempted it because none of the tools to do what I want to do with the Curio are available. I want to cut, etch, and engrave wood, metal, and leather. The deep cut blade, etching tool, and larger base are now on back-order until November. The Curio was released in August with the accessories set to release in October. I'm extremely disappointed about this. I had really high hopes for this machine and I really think Silhouette dropped the ball by not releasing the accessories at the same time as they released the machine. I gave it 3 stars because it cuts vinyl, heat transfer vinyl, paper, and etc well.

I already own 2 of the first Silhouette Cameo machines and the Silhouette Curio machine that was released last month. I'm very familiar with the Silhouette Studio software and the Silhouette Studio Designer Edition Software, which the previous machines use. The Silhouette Mint came with a new Mint Studio Software which is a very similar format to the Studio Software, but it is only for the Mint so far. The software was missing from my pre-release bundle, but after a couple of calls to Silhouette Customer Support, they sent me the link to download it. I'm 100% sure that this only happened because of the early release, so I'm not going to lower my 5 star rating because of it. I made a video/tutorial and took pictures I'm uploading to accompany this review. I was very pleased with how simple it was to open the software, import my own photo, and adjust the brightness and stamp filters to my liking. I clicked on the different stamp filters in my video to show the many choices, but I ultimately chose realistic for my dog stamp. The program automatically mirrors your design so that the stamped image looks the same as it does on your computer screen. After you are satisfied with your design, send your design to the Mint in the software, and insert the proper size stamp sheet into the back of your machine, in about a minute it comes out of the front of the machine, you then tear the cardboard on the dotted line around your stamp, peel away the cardboard, but try to keep the plastic that actually covers the stamped image on until after you've attached your stamp to the block, just to protect your image. Now attach it to the stamp base. Next, squeeze the ink onto your stamp and let it sit with the image face up for 5 minutes or more so that the stamp soaks up the ink like a sponge. The longer it sits, the more ink it will soak up. You then dab the excess ink off by stamping it on a sheet of paper until it looks good. When you are satisfied with the amount of ink on your stamp and it is stamping a crisp image, cap the stamp and use it up to 50 times before having to re-ink it. You can re-ink it in a different color the next time or several colors mixed together. The machine comes with enough materials to make 2 individual stamps, but you can buy the stamp sheets in the size of the blocks you already have and slide them on to the base you already have instead of buying more blocks every time. So, you only really have to buy one block per size and just use them with all of your Mint stamps. I am thrilled that this machine really does do exactly what it is supposed to do and it does an amazing job of it. I can't wait until the rest of the ink colors and stamp sizes are released so that I can make personalized address stamps as gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U15AR9E1QGLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSQX63O#wasThisHelpful","R1U15AR9E1QGLD","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This interactive camera has given our family, especially our ten year old son, a piece of mind when we are not home.  We have a puppy that's about a year old.  We enjoy being able to check in on her when we are out and about.The camera setup with our Apple products was rather quick and easy.  The app on our phone is quick and responsive.  We haven't had any issues with the operation of the camera or app.  The camera inside the cube is pointed downward so you'll need to place the cube higher up if you want the best point of view of bigger areas.  One thing I dislike is when you add someone to your family group for camera sharing purposes, you can't limit the time when they can view the camera which means they can access the camera anytime it's on.  So, don't add anyone to the family group unless you are okay with this.  It would've been nice had this one come with night vision, but we've read the next version will most likely have it.We recommend trying this one out if you enjoy checking on your loved ones when you are away from home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R383UH9LVV0UZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWN8O8#wasThisHelpful","R383UH9LVV0UZQ","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really into crafts and have several of the popular brand daylight type craft lamps. I was excited to try this because it's LED and has 3 brightness settings. My others don't have that option. I did a side my side comparison of this next to a comparable one of the other brand and this was brighter. This one also stood taller so it lit up a larger area. I'm often knocking my other ones over because of their lite bases, but this one has a large heavy base, so it stays in place if I accidentally hit it. The base also features a USB port which is perfect for me because I'm usually using my iPhone or iPad to read instructions on what I'm making. The design is slimmer than my other ones, so I feel like I can kind of look down at my project with nothing much obstructing my view.  It really is a nice lamp for crafting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RV48YNNLKIS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW76VW#wasThisHelpful","R3RV48YNNLKIS4","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited to get these because I love over the ear headphones, but the excitement ends there. The entire ear piece is made out of hard plastic, even the part that goes in your ear. They're very uncomfortable and bulky. The piece that goes around the ear slides up and down so that you can secure them to your ear better, but they still don't feel secure or comfortable. My 10 year old son tried them too and immediately told me ouch, those are hard and too big to get in my ear. I'm not even going to try to run with them because I don't even feel like they're secure when I'm sitting on the couch using them. The sound quality is decent for inexpensive headphones, but that is the only positive thing I can say about them. Save your money for some better ones.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15JQQGZD87NLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXO822K#wasThisHelpful","R15JQQGZD87NLC","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was excited to get this because I loved my little ponies when I was growing up and wanted to share the love with a little girl in my life. I must start by suggesting that you go to a quiet place alone to put this together. It's not hard, but there are several pieces and having tiny hands ""help"" you isn't ideal. I chose to put it together alone and was able to do it in about 45 minutes. I read directions thoroughly and try to make sure every part goes together properly. So, others may be faster at assembling it. I was happy that it came with one pony and her pet and many accessories, so there's no need to run out and by anything really, just to have things to go with it. Some of the scenery parts are cardboard, but the rest is durable plastic. I think it will hold up as long as some really destructive children don't intentionally destroy it. I love that it is large with several floors and that the doors and elevator actually work well. I highly recommend getting this set to any My Little Pony fan, young or old.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HX9Z2VBH3U59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4Q6G#wasThisHelpful","R1HX9Z2VBH3U59","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got my first FoodSaver machine on prime day. It's the basic V2244 model. I only purchased the off brand rolls with it and it came with a few FoodSaver brand ones. All of those worked fine for the produce, boneless chicken breasts, and ground beef I've been freezing, but for nuts and steak, I needed something that wouldn't puncture when the machine vacuumed the air out. I used these to freeze almonds, pecans, and sirloin steaks. It worked perfectly with no punctures at all. These are rolls, not individual bags, which I prefer because I like to choose how large my bags are instead of having waste or bags that are too small. I like to cut them in half after cutting the length I need to make individual portion size bags. These are what I'm using for nuts now. The box says Gamesaver on it, but as others noted, it worked flawlessly with my very basic machine, so I assume they would work with any vacuum seal system, as long as the seal area on the machine is wide enough for the bags.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J16MSVIUNLY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJPCTAE#wasThisHelpful","R2J16MSVIUNLY8","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this roll feeder to use with my cameo because I always have issues with the roll rolling off the table or getting sideways or bunched up. I didn't get it out of the box for over a month in and a half because I figured it would be more of a pain to use than it was worth..and THEN I was cutting 2 feet of vinyl off of a roll and it was almost done and the roll rolled off the table hitting the ground and yanking the cut part to the side and cutting it all crooked...so, I got this feeder out of the box, read the instructions, and had it all in place and working in 5 minutes. It was so simple to use. I just unpackaged it, pulled up the 2 side pieces that hold the vinyl roll, much like a wall mounted paper towel holder in my grandmas kitchen. I placed the roll in the perfect groove and with the holders in both ends then fed the vinyl thru the slit on the front. I used the included slicer to cut a perfect line. I love love the groove and slicer feature. I have the first cameo version, so mine didn't come with anything like that. When cutting vinyl from a roll, having a straight starting line is extremely important. Everything worked perfectly and I didn't have to worry about the vinyl rolling off the table. My only complaint about this roller is that they didn't make it go up to 15"". I buy 15"" htv rolls and would really like to use this with them as well. I skull love this, but figured it was worth noting. Maybe that is in the works for the next one. I do highly recommend this as long as you aren't using vinyl rolls larger than 12"".

"We have used various safes throughout the years to secure valuables and this one is the best yet.This safe is substantial, but if you're needing it to stay in place you'll need to bolt it to the floor or wall.We've had a similar safe in the past.  About six months past before opening it and the batteries had corroded inside the battery compartment so much that we had to throw it away completely.  So, yes batteries came with the safe, but we replaced them with fresh brand name batteries.The battery compartment is inside and at first I grew agitated because I could not figure out how I could open this safe if the batteries inside were dead.  I was getting frustrated until our 9 year old son pointed out where a separate battery can be connected in case this ever happens.  Yeah, I was a little embarrassed, but I was thrilled he discovered this feature.  This compartment is on the right side of the keypad on front of the door.The removable tray that locks is fairly flimsy.  The locking mechanism only secures one side of the tray which leave the other side somewhat easy to defeat.  I guess if you're already inside the safe there's not much need for a secure tray.Overall the safe is well made.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs some fire protection for valuables and documents and if your location allows you to secure it to a wall or the floor it would be ideal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWVHC0ZFKOBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1ZL1Q4#wasThisHelpful","R1EWVHC0ZFKOBW","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do a lot of crafting and sewing and have always printed out instructions and patterns and saved them in binders. I had always used a regular small 3 hole punch. I was lucky if it would make it through 2 sheets of copy paper let alone 45. This one does exactly what it advertised to do. It will punch through 45 sheets of paper with a little effort. I prefer to only do 10 or so at a time because I want my tools to last forever, but it can do it. It also punches through several sheets of card stock at once. I'm very happy with this hole punch and will be using it for all my print outs from now on. It is easy to align the paper. They don't slip when you punch down either.

"This indoor grill is the next best thing to actually grilling outside. I have had the Cuisinart 4 in 1 griddler for years and loved it, but then I got this one and loved it even more. The best thing about this one is that it comes with waffle plates as well as the regular ones. The Cuisinart only came with regular ones and I would have had to buy the waffle plates separately. I had the personal size Foreman when they first came out and I liked it ok, but I didn't like the clean up. This one is easy to clean. The plates are easily removable and wash up with minimal effort. They are labeled top and bottom where as the Cuisinart ones work on both sides. They are easy to put pack on as well. This grill cooks evenly every time and has plenty of room to cook everything for our family of 3 at one time. I can honestly say I'm finally giving up my beloved Cuisinart for the Evolve.

"I've been using a Fiskars 45mm rotary cutter, 6x24 Fiskars ruler, and cutting mat for years, and like them, but I started a beginner quilting class a couple of weeks ago and actually didn't like doing all that precise cutting. I found that after cutting for a while I'd get tired and sloppy and somehow measure wrong or my ruler would start slipping making my cuts off. After all the cutting, I was thinking I'd never quilt again after I finish this class until this morning, when everything changed. A very sweet lady I've become friends with in my quilting class told me about this and it happened to be on sale in a local store, so I headed out to get it. I couldn't wait to get it home and try it out on the rest of my ""homework."" I had to cut some more 2.5"" strips and it worked flawlessly. It takes very little pressure to make the cut and it's much safer than a regular rotary cutter because it's enclosed on top and doesn't even come out of the bottom until you press down to cut. The ruler part didn't slip around on my fabric because it has a pad that kind of grips the fabric on the bottom. The cutter doesn't slip because it's on it's own slider system that doesn't move from side to side. I can't wait to go back to class to show the instructor. This thing is a must have for quilters, crafters, and everyone in between. I could have used this a million times over the years, so if you're thinking about getting it, do it!

"If you have the standard straight shower rod, you should seriously consider getting one of these.  The extra room in the shower is wonderful.

One person could do it, but it's much easier with two.  I recommend you pay close attention to how high you mount it as others have mentioned about the length of your curtain and how high you want it to fall.  We held the shower rod up with the curtain on it to see how high we wanted to mount it.  We used a level to make sure the brackets and rod were level, marked the holes to drill, then took the rod down and mounted the brackets to the wall.

"We have used your basic cheap coffee makers, your k-cup makers, and even a Jura.  This is our first that is connected to the internet.This machine has a lot of possibilities.  The one advantage this has is the Wemo app allows you to schedule one brew in your coffee maker each day of the week.  For example, you can set your maker to brew at 7:00 am on Monday, 9:30 am on Tuesday, 6:00 am on Thursday and 5:00 am on Saturday and leave the rest of the week off.  If you're out and about and ready to head home, you can go onto the app and schedule a brew to be ready when you get home...as long as you have the water and coffee grounds in the machine.  The app is supposed to alert you when 90 brew cycles have been performed or when the brew time takes longer than it is supposed too which means it is time to run some white vinegar through it to do a 50 minute cleaning cycle.Set up was straight forward.  I downloaded the app.  My phone found the machine with no issue.  It connected to my router without issue.  Then it indicated a firmware update was available which I had it to install and took less than five minutes.I brewed some water to clean it as directed, cleaned the carafe (which is very nice compared to those glass ones I've been breaking), and got my first brew running.Moments later I received an alert on my phone telling me my coffee was ready!

"The HP Stream 14 Quad Core Laptop with Beats Audio (Natural Silver) performs great for its capabilities.  This is no powerhouse or high-end gaming computer.  It isn’t weighed down with a heavy battery, so don’t expect the juice to last a long time before recharging after extended use.  We browse the internet, watch a few videos and have to plug it in to charge about every three days or so.  The product states the average battery lasts 6.5 hours.  This is just about what we get with our use.  This computer is thin and lightweight, yet it feels sturdy and well-constructed.  It performs all basic internet browsing and word processing without any major issues.  Internet pages load reasonable well.  It isn’t the fastest, but it isn’t the most expensive either.  Music sounds great for its speaker size.  Videos are crystal clear.  For the price, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better Windows PC.  I am not a fan of Windows 8 without a touchscreen, but that capability adds more expense.  I am not a big fan of AMD either, but I’ve had no problems with it so far.  Chromebooks have their advantages like quick startup, but they have their limitations as related to Google to some degree.  This HP doesn’t start as quickly as a Chromebook, but it operates more like a regular PC since it is Windows based.  It’s not a full blown PC in that it has no optical drive and its hard drive space is very limited.If you’re looking for a basic computer, this one fits the bill.  It’s so easy to operate, our nine year old son has basically taken it over and calls it his.  Don’t take that wrong.  This is not a toy PC.  Our son is technologically advanced and he gives this his stamp of approval.  You should also look at a few other reviews and note that HP does read the reviews and takes the time to reply to those who have had issues in an attempt resolve problems.

"Let me start by saying I've never used a roaster oven, but have always wanted one, so I have nothing to compare this to. I actually loved the results I got with it. I read other reviews and decided to stick my chicken in a roasting bag because I like the crock pot bags in a crock pot because of the clean up. I figured this would have about the same clean up, and it did. I always spray the sides of my crock pot with non stick spray before using it, so I did with this as well. It really makes a huge difference. This roaster is huge. I imagine with my family of 3, that we will only use it during the holidays, but at least it gives us other options since there are always things going in and out of the oven when all the family is here, so my bird can be in another area not occupying the oven and getting dried out as people open and close it putting bread in and out etc. I got even cooking with my bird, but did notice that some of the juices that were in the corners were kind of burnt to the roasting bag. The same thing happens with my crock pot and crock pot bags. I gave this 5 stars, because I liked it and without having ever tried another, I would recommend it to others. It frees up much needed space on the holidays.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOVFKEO1D0TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNMJ1QO#wasThisHelpful","ROOVFKEO1D0TI","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CX4JSS) for about the last five years and it is still going strong.  The Oral-B has two speeds.  I use the sensitive speed setting.  The handle part is rounded and easy to hold.I've always thought I wanted a Sonicare, but I haven't tried one until now.  This Sonicare has one speed and it's intensely powerful...much more than the Oral-B to me.  The handle  doesn't feel as comfortable in my hand either.  The bristles are extremely soft and with the higher speed it does tickle somewhat.I'm going to give it a few weeks or so and see how it goes.  Right now I'm tempted to go back to my Oral-B.  There's nothing wrong with the Sonicare and if I had never had an electric toothbrush before, I'm sure I'd love it.So, yes, I'd recommend it, but I'd also recommend trying out others.  Everything is a personal preference.The Sonicare left my teeth clean and it did exactly what it was supposed to.

"I was really impressed with this pet bed. We got it for our new puppy. It's too nice for us to trust her alone with just yet, so she lays on it in the livingroom when we are watching her, but when she is old enough, this will be her main bed. She really does like it because it is very tall and she is very short. It allows her to be raised up to get more attention when we are sitting on the couch and we place it next to the couch. It makes it easier for us to bend over and give her attention. It is very comfortable from what I can tell as well. It really is like a mattress for her. I think it looks pretty sitting out too. My son wants it in his room by his bed so she can sleep near him eventually. I love that the cover zips off, so that I can throw it in the wash. It comes off easy and is easy to put back on. I've had harder times stuffing a pillow into it's pillow case than getting this back in the cover, so it's a winner for me. I like that they added a handle because it is pretty bulky and it makes it easier to carry around, if you take it from room to room, like we do. Our dog is small, but I'd imagine that this would be great for tiny all the way to medium size dogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARNQ851VT01O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQAQZRE#wasThisHelpful","R2ARNQ851VT01O","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This paper towel holder was a breeze to install. We simply measured to see where we wanted it and used a level to make sure it was straight, then drew a mark where the 2 screws should go, drilled the holes large enough for the anchors to slide in and then put the holder up and screwed in the screws.

"I’ve tried two different cases for my iPhone 6.  I normally carry my phone in a top closed shirt pocket during the week in the daytime.  In the evenings and on weekends I carry it in side pockets of cargo pants and shorts.  I’m quite conscious of my phone and handle it as carefully as possible.I wanted a case that was minimal and did a good job of protecting the phone on the corners.  I first tried the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LL60JU8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Spigen Tough Armor case.  It has a slick back to it.  The areas where the sides of the case are cut away seem weak and flimsy.  I carried it for about three weeks with no issues other than disliking the slick back.  The front, inside edges of the case are very minimal…more minimal than what I preferred, but it was doing the job.I decided to try the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LCAVSO4Urban Armor Gear case.  This case looks much more durable.  After I placed my phone in it, I immediately could tell the difference between it and the Spigen Tough Armor.  The Urban Armor Gear is not nearly as slick on the back.  The sides have ridges and spots that are easier to hold on to while using my phone.  The places that have cutouts for the ports on the sides are a little weak and more flimsy than the rest, but not nearly as weak as the Spigen’s sides.  The Urban Armor’s corner areas on the front are deeper and much better protected too.  The outside of the corners are actually raised higher than the sides.I’ve kept the Urban Armor Gear on my phone.  I feel my phone is better protected with it.I’d recommend the Urban Armor Gear case to anyone who wants a minimal case with exceptional features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPEN608ZVPEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCAVSO4#wasThisHelpful","R1BPEN608ZVPEZ","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm no professional painter, but I painted a lot in the first home we owned and now we've purchased a house that we are completely redoing. We are priming and painting every surface that can be done in the house. I'm talking built-ins, ceiling, trim, walls, doors, AND cabinet paint, so I needed a more effective corner or trim brush. I was previously using the Wooster Short Cut, which I've been using for years, but this is a huge job and having to be done over a short period of time. I only painted when I wanted to change up a room in the past. So, I opened this brush up yesterday and started cutting in on the wall where it meets the textured ceiling. It worked perfect. The tip is much sharper and smaller than the shortcut, so it allowed me to get right up in the groove between the wall and ceiling for a seamless job. I cut in around the windows, door trim, and cabinets as well with ease and perfection. We removed the baseboards because we are putting in new flooring as well, so I can't review on how well it works there, but I would bet just as well. It took a little getting used to holding the fatter triangle shaped brush, but I got used to it and actually think it's more comfortable to hold. I'll be repainting the door and window trim in the next week or so and will update my review to reflect my thoughts on that part of the job with this brush. My overall all advice as of now is, don't be afraid to try this brush because it looks strange. I wish I would have tried it several years ago when I first saw it. It would have made all my projects come out more perfect and saved me some stress. I hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W77IJWTMOVR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O3OQBM#wasThisHelpful","R1W77IJWTMOVR1","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying I collect Le Creuset cookware. This looks similar, but features the non stick finish and isn't nearly as heavy. I hate to admit it, but I prefer using this over my Le Creuset grill pan now. I've used it a few times and it's just better. I love love the non stick feature. It cooks evenly on my largest burner and everything comes out tasting great without leaving the best part stuck in the pan. My favorite thing to cook in it is bologna because I love the crispy grill marks and flavor it leaves. I choose to hand wash mine, but it says it can be washed in the dishwasher. In my experience, you will get the most longevity out of cookware if you hand wash it. I also don't use abrasive scrubbers. I use the one made for non stick surfaces. Only time will tell how the non stick coating holds up, so I will update my review as needed. If this pan holds up, I will be investing in many more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4B2NPXTFBFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGNE4FQ#wasThisHelpful","R2W4B2NPXTFBFN","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say enough great things about this adapter. It solved a few problems we were having using regular outlets. We have many devices with the big box type plugs, so we could only charge one of those at a time. With this, we can plug in 4 of the large box type plugs and 2 of our USB devices. We've had all the plugs going at once with no problem at all. I haven't used the mounting part yet because we are in the process of moving and I don't want to mount it until we are moved in to our new home, but I will update my review once I do. This is heavy, but I place it in a partially opened drawer when in use so that it doesn't slide around or fall if someone is using one of the devices that's plugged into it.

"Let me start my review by saying that I currently own the Polar FT7 heart rate monitor, Fitbit Flex, and now this, so I'm not a complete stranger to this kind of thing. I'm a runner and like to know how hard I'm working when I run. This tracker does that pretty well, but isn't as accurate as the Polar FT7 on the heart rate. The Fitbit flex has the same issue, so if your main concern is your heart rate when you're working out and you want accuracy, choose the Polar FT7, because it has a chest strap that makes it much more accurate. So, when I run, I wear this one one arm and the FT7 on the other. I like that I can keep up with my entire day of activity with this and have it stored in my Basis account. I have the iphone 5s and had no issues at all with installing the app and syncing my device. It was simple to sync after as well using blue tooth. I charge this every few days when I notice it getting low, but it doesn't take long, so you can get right back to wearing it. It is pretty bulky, but that is to be expected with this type of watch. It reminds me of the calculator watch my dad wore when I was young, but I'm getting used to it. I love that I can see my workout on the screen, compared to the fitbit, where I have to look at my app to see my progress. My main complaint I have about this tracker is that the band wouldn't stay snapped onto the watch face after only a few times of me wearing it. So, I tried my best to call the company, but there is literally no customer service phone number anywhere on the internet. I ended up emailing them with my problem, because I couldn't even wear it for a second without it popping back off. They didn't answer my email for several days, but were quick to respond to my public posts on their facebook page about my tracker. I just have issues with companies that I can't call personally and speak with. I even asked them to please call me in my email, and nothing. They did replace the watch and I sent the defective one back with a prepaid label. The new one stays together so far, but it took a few uses last time, so we shall see. I will update my review accordingly. I gave this 3 stars because it is a nice concept and I do enjoy it, although it's not completely accurate, it does give me an idea of how active I've been and how my sleeping is going. I recommend this to anyone looking for an all in one type of tracker mainly to just track your daily activity. I gave this 3 stars because of the slow customer service and the first one being broken. I hope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22DIU9S2FJO4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4E6ZK4#wasThisHelpful","R22DIU9S2FJO4I","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have the Panasonic ES8109S Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, which is essentially the same as the Panasonic ES8103S Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, just with the cleaning system, so I'm not new to this type of electric razor. I'm a woman and I suffer from razor burn if I use an actual razor in some areas of my body, so a couple of years ago, my husband bought me the ES8109S to use in my bikini area and my arm pits. So, I was excited to get this one and that it was washable. I would never buy one that couldn't be rinsed clean. So, with that being said, this is a great razor, especially at this price point. It is a fraction of the cost of the Panasonic, but functions just as well(minus the waterproof function). The handle is slightly bulkier, but not enough to make it uncomfortable to hold. I had to charge it for a day initially, which is standard with most rechargeable devices, so that was no big deal. After the initial charge, it charges extremely fast, so if you let it die, you can use it plugged in or you can charge it rather quickly without it ruining your morning. The pivot head is great for all of the angles your body or face has. My only complaint is that I can't use it in the shower, it's not a big deal and it isn't marketed to be used in the shower, so I'm not taking off stars for that. This shaves just as close, if not closer than my Panasonic, so I've been using it non-stop since getting it. This is a great little razor and worth trying out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCWN845PWZY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB5YHEI#wasThisHelpful","R2MCWN845PWZY7","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a runner and I currently own the Fitbit Flex, Basis health tracker, and  the Polar FT7 Heart Rate Monitor Watch, so I have a few things to compare this to. The only good things I really have to say about this tracker is that it is comfortable to wear and it has a great price point. In this case, you definitely get what you pay for. I used this with my son's iphone 4s because I didn't want to add another app to my 5s. Entering all of my weight, height, etc info was easy enough and  getting it to sync the first time was easy, once I got the phone close to the band, but after the initial sync, it was a pain. I can't stand that I have to make it sync on my own. The Fitbit flex and Basis band, both have the ability to do it on their own when I'm within range of my phone. I wore this, the fitbit flex, and the Polar FT7, which I wear a chest strap with and know it is accurate, all together for a day and I found this one to be the farthest from the accurate reading. It wasn't even in the same ball park. Like others have stated, this thing tracks every wiggle as a step and you end up ""supposedly"" walking a half marathon each day, which was way off. The sleep pattern feature is a joke. I forgot to switch it to sleep mode almost every night I wore it. The Fitbit senses you're sleeping on it's own eventually, if you forget to switch it to sleep mode. Depending on what you're actually looking for and your price point, I recommend the Polar FT7 or a Fitbit flex. The Polar FT7 is what I use only during my workout to get the most accurate calorie count, heart rate, etc. It wouldn't be good for an all-day type of thing, because it does require a chest strap. It doesn't track sleep patterns and there's no online competition with it. I recommend the Fitbit flex or similar Fitbit products if you are looking for an all around type of device. It at least gives you an idea of your sleep pattern and activity levels. It's not as accurate as the Polar FT7, but without a chest strap, you aren't going to get a 100% reading from anything. I hope this helps. The one good thing about this band, is that my 8yo son, now has this band as ""his"" since I'm not using it. He's happy he has one like me and he loves putting it in sleep mode and seeing how many steps he's made in a day. It's completely inaccurate, but he has no clue, so that may be a good reason for someone to purchase this, but it isn't for anyone that is serious about tracking their activity.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTWYOYMQ5TEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GY9DJCC#wasThisHelpful","R2PTWYOYMQ5TEI","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This vacuum out of the box was extremely easy to assemble. It took only a few minutes for me to have it up and running. I already own the Hoover Tempo WidePath Bagged Upright Vacuum U5140900, so I know how well Hoovers work. This one was no different. It has great suction even compared to my older Hoover and the fact that I can vacuum my kitchen floors by turning off the brushes is a huge plus because I despise sweeping the floors. It's extremely easy to empty the canister too. I use the upholstery/dusting brush attachment for my couches and recliners. I have microfiber furniture and sometimes things tend to stick to it, so this was probably my favorite feature. I don't find this heavy to push around either, but it is a little difficult to wrestle up and down the stairs. I only took it upstairs one time then decided that I'd just leave my old Hoover up there since I have an extra one that works well. I've never found it fun to wrestle any vacuum up and down the stairs, so this one wasn't any more difficult than my other one. My only real complaint about this vacuum and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the cord is sticky on mine. It gets stuck when it's almost all the way reeled in, about 75% of the time. When it happens, I have to pull it back out a little ways and try again. This isn't a big deal to me because I'm used to one that doesn't wind inside, but since it's a selling feature on this unit, I took a star off because of it. Other than that, I highly recommend this vacuum. We love the color and high end look, but budget friendly price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RSNJ9MAI77Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLJ1U92#wasThisHelpful","R11RSNJ9MAI77Q","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just moved into a 3 story condo and the bedrooms are in the basement, so they stay cold. When I saw this, I was so excited to try it because my son's bedroom stays the coldest as it is in the middle of the house and gets no direct sun. We were using one of those small heaters, which was great, but uses a lot of power. This mattress pad solved all the problems we were having. It is perfect on low. We turn it on about 30 minutes before he goes to bed to get it warms up for him and it's nice and warm when he gets in. It's 19 degrees here and he's sleeping in shorts and a t-shirt and completely comfortable. It has a 10 hour auto shut off, which I love, but I do push the on and off button just before I walk out of his room at night to start the 10 hours over. He can't stand it any higher than low, but that's fine with me. It's just enough to keep him cozy. I highly recommend this to anyone sleeping in a cold room. It really works great, and unlike an electric blanket, it warms the mattress and essentially the comforter, because heat rises. My son cannot keep his covers on at night, so an electric blanket wouldn't stay on him either, this one, he can't kick off. It's perfect for us all the way around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WL1F3MJBZQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHW8P94#wasThisHelpful","R30WL1F3MJBZQD","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned the Brother 1034D serger for several years and this is identical. The only difference is the color scheme and that this comes with 2 extra presser feet and some extra thread. Amazon even uses the 1034D pictures in this ones listing. This, like the 1034D is the best serger on the market at this price point. They are also of very high quality. My 1034D has been dropped off of a collapsing table and still worked. They are tough machines. If you're buying a serger, I assume you are somewhat experienced at sewing. I consider myself a little experienced at this point, but still can't figure out how to thread this thing from start to finish even with watching the videos. So, ALWAYS tie it off like the video recommends and just change your thread like that. I wouldn't try to thread it yourself from the start unless you're sure you know how. If you're considering this machine look at the 1034D as well, as it is currently cheaper on Amazon, but doesn't come with the extra 2 presser feet. I only use the standard one myself, so the 1034D would be all I need, but you may need the others.

"I was a Janome snob up until a year ago when I got my first Brother sewing machine. It was the Brother HC1850 computerized sewing and quilting machine and is identical to this one. This one has a few more stitches and comes with a few more presser feet, but other than that, I can't tell a difference.This machine is extremely easy to set up. You can use it with or without the pedal since it's computerized. I did use it without the pedal to test it, but I don't like sewing without a pedal, so I only sewed a few stitches, which stitched perfectly, then sewed with the pedal. I'm old fashioned like that. I feel more in control using my foot, like in a car. I don't sew elaborate outfits, but I do sew pretty often and this machine can do anything I want to do and comes with the presser feet for every job I could dream of. I don't quilt, but do enjoy using the large quilting table when I sew baby blankets.The only issue at all I've had with the Brother machines is using the threader. It's user error on my part. I guess I missed it in the instructions on my first one, but you push that button to the top right of the needle with the needle and thread picture on it to get the needle in the upper most position before pulling the thread lever down. I was trying to turn the wheel to do it manually and it would never be in the perfect position. There's also a line on the wheel that you can line up with the machine if you prefer to turn the wheel on your own, but regardless, it needs to be in the perfect position before threading to work properly. That's the only issue at all I've had and like I said, that was my own fault for missing it in the instructions.In my opinion, Brother has the best sewing machine on the market for the price. The customer service department is awesome as well. If you have any issues at all, call them and they'll make sure you're helped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N568IH5DQNN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJW543I#wasThisHelpful","R2N568IH5DQNN5","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Out of the box, the Camelio is easy to start up. It does say you have to charge it first, so we were able to play with it within 2 hours. This tablet is no ipad, but good as a starter tablet for younger kids that don't already have an ipad or equivalent. We already have an ipad, so I thought my 8 year old was going to laugh at this, but surprisingly, he was really into it for a week or so. I think because it was ""his"", but then the newness wore off and he hasn't showed much interest in it in a while. Keep in mind he has a ton of other electronics, so that may be why he lost interest. The wifi works most of the time, but this is extremely inexpensive, so maybe that's ok with most people. I gave it 4 stars because it is geared toward younger kids, does do what it's supposed to do, for the most part, and is inexpensive enough that if your child was to lose it, it wouldn't be a huge loss. My son was able to get online and on twitter with no issues. It's much slower than our ipad and iphones, but once again, in this price point, I'd expect it to have minor issues. It still isn't terribly slow, just not as fast. I like that it has the option of buying character covers and theme, but my son is a little past that, so I just bought a generic 7"" tablet case and it works great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTE0F1JOAZ2MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR6RUSY#wasThisHelpful","RTE0F1JOAZ2MH","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will start by saying that I am a complete beginner when it comes to embroidery. I sew, but had never even attempted embroidery until I got this machine. I actually bought Brother PE500 4x4 Embroidery Machine With 70 Built-in Designs and 5 Fonts and was so intimidated that I gave it to my friend without ever even trying it. So, this shows up at my door and I immediately get it out and set up. It was extremely easy to set up and the instruction manual was super easy to follow. Threading the machine was even easy. You just pay close attention to the instructions on where the thread goes. The arrows guide you the entire way. The needle threader works flawlessly, just make sure you put your presser foot down before threading the needle. I speak from experience when I say it won't work unless you lower it. This machine doesn't like 40 Spools Polyester Embroidery Machine Thread. I tried several different colors and they kept getting knotted up and would eventually break. I was worried it was the machine, but switched back to the Brother thread included with the machine and it ran flawlessly, but that thread is hard to find, so I ended up buying Floriani thread from a local sewing shop after a friend recommended it and it has ran flawlessly with it.This machine comes with every single thing you need to get started besides the fabric. I loved that because I didn't know if I'd prefer tear away stabilizer or cut away. Different people prefer different things. I learned that I prefer tear away because it's one less step I have to mess with, but it's really just my preference. It comes with quite a few prewound bobbins for the bottom thread and several extra bobbins as well. It also comes with some amazing little scissors. They are so sharp and the perfect angle for trimming applique designs after you stitch the basting stitch.It has many preloaded designs, but most of those really aren't my style, so I was eager to use my flash drive to transfer designs. From what I read in the book, you can't have more than 200 designs on the flash drive you are plugging into the machine or else it won't read and you can only have PES files on it. So, I made sure the flash drive I used was empty then just added the designs I had ordered from a website. I could view them once I plugged the flash drive into the machine. It's grainy looking, but still easy to make out and tell which design you are choosing. I did several appliques as well as just plain embroidery designs. I'm still trying to master how to get everything perfectly centered and straight, but I'm sure I will get better with time. I've uploaded several pictures of what I've been working on since receiving this machine.I highly recommend this machine to anyone looking at getting into embroidery. It's a great entry level machine, but still nice enough for people that have been doing this a long time. I'm just thrilled with the results. Don't be intimidated. If you can thread a sewing machine, you can do this. I did have a hard time finding information about this machine on the internet, so I just used tutorials I had found for the Brother PE770 5 inch x7 inch Embroidery-only machine with built-in memory, USB port, 6 lettering fonts and 136 built-in designs. From what I can tell, they are the same exact machine, this may just be a newer version. All of the tutorials I watched applied to this machine as well, so if you find yourself stuck, look that one up.*Update*Since writing this review and doing a ton of research, I found a much less expensive embroidery software that works like a dream for me. It's called Sew What Pro and is highly recommended in the embroidery world. It can be downloaded straight from the internet with a simple search. They even offer a free 30 day trial which allows you to do 50+ designs just to make sure you like it before purchasing. I just couldn't see buying the Brother software for my little hobby. I hope this helps other hobbyist like myself, because I was so excited to find it. It works like a dream with this machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16JH1XOA8DLGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJW5Q18#wasThisHelpful","R16JH1XOA8DLGO","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not new to craft cutting machines. I've had theCricut Mini Cutting Machine, Cricut Expression Electronic Cutting Machine, and Silhouette Cameo Starter Kit Bundle Cutter. I thought that since this machine is Brother brand and advertises it's ability to cut appliques, that it would work with my Brother embroidery machine, but it won't. I had even seen a machine in my local sewing shop and they said that it could  cut appliques with the PES software, but after contacting Brother, they said that is false. The embroidery machine and the Scan N Cut use completely different files and there was no way to use them together. So, that was a big let down. I have software for craft cutting machines that works on my Silhouette Cameo and my original Cricut Expression, but won't work on the Scan N Cut because all the other machines take SVG files, but this one takes FMC files. I read on the website that Brother is working on cloud based software that will allow me to convert all of my SVG files into FMC files, but I wonder how much that will set me back? I like the scanning feature, but don't like that 99% of the things I want to cut I can't find a clear image for. Even when I do find a clear enough image, I have to waste ink printing it out on my printer, then scan it in and try to edit, size, and move the image on the tiny screen. I much prefer using a computer screen with the virtual mat, then just positioning the paper to be cut on the mat and pushing cut.I did attempt to cut Oracle 651 vinyl on the machine following the settings recommended in the little start up guide. It recommended cutting on a blade setting of 4 on the turquoise blade. That cut way too deep. When you cut vinyl, you only want the machine to cut through the top vinyl part, not all the way through the backing, so I tried it on 3 and it was still too deep, so eventually I set it on 1 and that was perfect. It cut through only the top layer leaving the sticker backing so I could peel away the negative space and use transfer tape to apply my vinyl to my project. I cut card stock successfully using their recommended blade setting of 4, but it left deep cut marks in my mat, so I reduced it to 3 and that worked fine without such a deep cut on the mat. I would definitely recommend playing with it to see what your preferences are. Cutting that deep all the time will wear your mat out in a hurry and they are pretty costly. Which leads to my next issue with this machine. The replacement mats and blades are more expensive than the replacement items for the Cameo. The tools that this machine comes with look like toys in comparison to the Cricut and Silhouette brand tools. The edges aren't sharp enough to really get under things and there's no hook tool at all for weeding vinyl.My overall thoughts on this machine are that they should have waited until they had the SVG software to release it. They really jumped the gun. As is, it doesn't even compare to the Silhouette Cameo's design capabilities. They should also be very clear in their advertising that this machine doesn't work along side the embroidery machine to applique designs. I'm learning that many other people thought they'd work hand in hand as well. If they release some amazing software that makes this thing great, I'll update my review, but as of right now, I say go for the Cameo instead. The scanner is very nice on this and it would be a great machine if it had the design capabilities that other machines have, but it just doesn't. My fingers are crossed that they get it figured out and release something. It has so much potential.*Update*Since writing this review, Brother Released the Canvas program on 11/08/13 that allows you to design projects on your computer to cut on the Scan N Cut in an online program. It works ok, but doesn't allow you to download svg's as of yet. The Brother website say's it's coming, but it the ability to cut or convert your SVG files is not available yet, and my biggest gripe about the software is that I still have to put my design on a flash drive and plug it into the machine. I wish it was like other cutter programs that allow you to use a printer cord to plug your computer directly into your machine, then do everything on your computer, but feed the mat and change the blade depth. This still has a long way to go to compare to those programs. I would still recommend the Silhouette Cameo and software over this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IU147X2ZWBQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3J38GQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IU147X2ZWBQE","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent monitor for this price point. I currently own the Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black and the Polar FT7 Heart Rate Monitor, Blue/Lilac, which requires a chest strap. I find that the Polar FT7 is he most accurate, then the LifeTrak and the least accurate is the Fitbit, but the fitbit isn't a heart rate monitor. It's actually just an exercise tracker. So, I will only compare this to the Polar. The LifeTrak is much larger on the wrist than the Polar, but much more comfortable considering there's no chest strap. The step counter is usually about the same for both when I wear them together, but the heart rate is off by a point or 2 at times. I would still choose the LifeTrak over the Polar even with it being a little off just based on the comfort level. I think that alone makes it worth buying, not to mention the price point. I am a smaller female and this watch fits me with plenty of room to expand. It has a lot of holes, but could be an issue for a man or woman with larger wrists. I don't really sinc mine much because I record it on my calendar each day when I'm done exercising, but I did sinc it to my newer iphone just to make sure it's possible and it did it flawlessly. So, I definitely recommend this for anyone that's looking for a comfortable and no fuss heart rate monitor. It will definitely give you a fairly accurate idea of how much you're body is working.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RF8VXXK3UKJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRGO6AK#wasThisHelpful","R2RF8VXXK3UKJJ","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reason I got this monitor was because of the temperature sensor. My son's room is on the front of the house and is always the coldest room in the winter and the hottest room in the summer. I didn't even know that monitors with temperature sensors existed before seeing this one, so I was excited to get it, to say the least. It was easy enough to set the temperature alert by following the instructions and it's not an annoying alarm that goes off if the temperature gets in a too hot or too cold range. It's just a beep. I've learned to read the instructions carefully before starting any electronics over the years, so it was easy for me to set up after studying it for a few minutes. After getting it set up, I tested the nightlight, which isn't too bright, but isn't too dim either. It's more like the unit just glows which is nice. The lullaby function is nice, but nothing that I will use on a regular basis because I leave a radio and air purifier going in his room at night. I have the sensitivity set on medium and I can hear the low roar of the air purifier and just a little bit of the music, but that's something I'm used to listening to in my sleep. When I set it on low, I don't hear anything unless he calls me or cries and then it just kicks on so that I can hear it. The range on this is great. My yard isn't tiny and I can take the parent monitor out to take the trash out at night and to check the mail during the day without any static or issues. The only thing that could make this unit better is if it had a video function, but I know this isn't a video unit. I trust the Philips brand and highly recommend this monitor. It's working like a charm so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZGK146DKUP9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9RMHD8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZGK146DKUP9D","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really had high hopes for this cabinet, but it's just ok. The instructions were easy enough for me to follow and it was easy for me to assemble alone and then I had my husband help me hang it, which wasn't difficult considering we've hung tons of things over the years. I gave it 3 stars because it does work good for storing spray paint, paint brushes, and small stain cans, but is too lightweight for the heavier tools my husband was hoping to use it for. He just didn't trust it for his heavy and high quality tools. I would imagine most people that want this are planning on storing heavier stuff, so it might not be ideal for some people. I would have really liked a locking option as well, just in case someone leaves the garage door open, but I knew that it didn't have one on the front end, so I'm not reviewing based on that. It's just a suggestion. My cabinet actually came packaged very well and was in perfect condition out of the box. I liked the finish on both the doors and cabinet itself, so if you are looking for a cabinet for lightweight items, this may be the one for you, but if you're wanting it for heavier items, you should definitely look at getting something else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0PS2MT35GBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UQ0FAQ#wasThisHelpful","RN0PS2MT35GBK","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say I am not the most technologically advanced person ever.  This review will cover my experience in setting up, updating, and general use of this laptop.My family and I have had various brands of computers.  Before we tried this one, we've had HP, ASUS, and Gateway.  We have one wireless router that has been working well for several years.  We have an older iPad, two iPhone 4S smartphones, an iPhone 3g that's used as an iPod by our 8 year old son, and a couple gaming systems.  Before this newest addition to our electronics world, everything was working just fine.Enter Toshiba.  We knew this was going to be bigger than the laptops we were used to, but this was bigger than expected.  It's not too big for home use.  I wouldn't want to lug it around an airport on a vacation trip though.This thing is gorgeous.  The back-lit keyboard is in red.  The logo on the outside glows red when closed and its really a good looking computer.The power cord is much thicker and bigger than any others we've used before, but to feed this powerhouse I guess you have to have a good flow of juice.  The way it connects is different than others we've had.  The plug has a larger diameter insert.  It doesn't feel like it really plugs in very solidly.  I can only wonder how it will hold up over time as it gets moved around the house being plugged and unplugged.The initial start-up was fast and easy.  When we went to download some larger programs from the Internet, it would bog down and lose our wireless Internet connection.  This happened over and over.  We went to Toshiba's website and made sure to install and update all new and current drivers.  We spent about two hours researching potential issues online until we decided we couldn't figure it out and called Toshiba.After going thru the normal automated phone system we finally reached a person with Toshiba.  He asked typical questions.  He did not attempt to have us do any software updates.  Instead he had us do a complete restore which he said would take several hours.  We were not happy.  He tried to get us off the phone and to have us call back later when the computer is finished, but we kept insisting a restore would not fix anything since it was probably a driver or software issue.  He pushed our issue to a Tier Two person.  As we were talking with her, the computer restore function finished.  It took maybe 20 minutes, not hours like we were told.  This lady remoted into the computer. She had us download some programs which would cause the computer to lose the wireless Internet connection.  She went into our router and changed the frequency, but that had no positive effect.  As she was remoting into the machine she went to the Toshiba website and check the updates and drivers.  All the newest updates and drives were installed.  After a couple hours she basically said we would have to box it up and sent to Toshiba.  We insisted there must be an issue with the driver for the wireless card.  She had us download the driver and save it on the desktop.  As she was talking to us on the phone, she had us uninstall the driver that was in the computer and restart it.  Of course this made it where we could not connect wirelessly until we opened and installed the wireless driver.  We found out the newest version of the driver was not working, but when an older version from earlier this year was installed everything was good in the world again.Overall we spent over seven hours working on this computer just to get it running like it is supposed to.  Had we not stuck to our guns, it would've taken much longer and it would've been sent back to Toshiba just to probably have the same issue again.  We were told they were sending this to their developers so hopefully by the time you read this, you won't have this same issue.We use this computer to operate a Silhouette Cameo Starter Kit Bundle Cutter with the Designer software and a Cricut Expression Electronic Cutting Machine with Sure Cuts A Lot 2 software, that need a lot of system power to run.  These cutting machines were previously connected to a smaller computer with much less power and size and when we used it, it would slow down and take some time to complete a crafting project.  With this Toshiba, there's not one hiccup.  It blazes thru it.I'd say our precious computers were more like an economic 4 cylinder manual transmission and this Toshiba is at least a V8 automatic powerhouse.This isn't your basic, entry level computer.  So, if you're considering this we imagine you know what your looking for.Good luck!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UK1SPAKDNM0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3F7F3O#wasThisHelpful","R2UK1SPAKDNM0M","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that this is a nice little kit and comes with 3 different sizes of stamping blocks that have the grids to help you get your stamps straight. It comes with three sheets of stamping material, a special stamp material mat, a silhouette ink pad in black, a download card for some exclusive stamping designs, and a DVD tutorial that leaves a little to be desired. When I ordered this I thought for some reason, that it would produce a carved stamp instead of just a cut out letter or shape, but it doesn't. So, if you cut out the word ""stamp"" and you don't weld it to make the letters connect, then you will have to line up each individual letter one by one and make sure you get them completely straight on your stamping block. This can be really tedious if you have small or a lot of letters. My cameo cut the stamping material the first time with no issues at all by simply following the tutorial, changing the mat to the one in the kit, and changing the blade setting to the recommended number. My letters were perfect and the ink included worked perfectly on card stock. I tried to use Staz On brand ink and it beaded up and wouldn't produce a clean image. I tried several times and it just would not work. The ink was brand new, so I'm thinking that the stamping material just won't soak it up properly. So, please keep that in mind when using this material. Overall, this is a great product. Just keep in mind that the machine is not carving the stamp out. You will have to position your stamp on the block every time you want to use it. Also remember to flip your words to be backward when the bottom of your stamp is facing you and to where it looks correct when you flip it over like you are going to stamp with it. Both sides of the material are the same, so you can use whichever side you want. There's no need to flip your word in the program. I'm posting some pics to show my results. I hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZSCCRS9C1SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB0B446#wasThisHelpful","R1DZSCCRS9C1SP","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say that I was skeptical of this grill mainly because it is a George Foreman and I always thought his products were too commercialized and not of good quality, but they thought of everything with this one. I have the Cuisinart GR-4N 5-in-1 Griddlerand love it so much that I used it at least once a week, until I got this one. What makes this one superior, is that it cooks more evenly, even when there is a lot of meat on it and the option to lean the grill to drain off fat or to leave it flat to cook in the juices. The Cuisinart only allows for flat cooking and the grease always leaks onto my counter top. I assumed they all did, but I've had no issues at all with this one leaking. This one is a little larger, but is a pretty color, so that helps with aesthetics. It is easy to clean and has removable dish-washer safe plates, although I recommend hand washing them in order to prolong the life. I also recommend using butter or oil over non-stick spray because it will eventually cause the non-stick coating to come off of the plates. All in all, this is a great indoor grill and a great value over the more popular brands. I will update my review as far as durability as time goes by.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFU00UHNOUSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI51TIM#wasThisHelpful","RXFU00UHNOUSU","A1FK14ZCV3B1RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FK14ZCV3B1RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the pleasure of trying both the Honeywell 12,000 and 10,000 BTU portable air conditioners.  Both were used in bedrooms approximately 12 feet by 12 feet on a second floor.  Both were packaged well.  Both had convenient wheels on bottom to make it easy to move around.  The main units required no assembly.  Both came with the same hose and window brackets to allow the exhaust and heat to escape.The one main problem was how the window brackets fit in the window.  I had to use some extra foam insulation strips to fill in the gaps.  The bracket is in two pieces that slide together in the middle to allow you to use it in different size windows.  One side is more narrow than the other side which allows you to adjust the width for the size of the window.  This means the wider side fits fairly snug in the window and the narrow side has a gap.The hose connection at the rear of the unit can be finicky and wants to disconnect fairly easily.Both units worked like a charm.  Both dropped the temperature of the room rather quickly and kept the room a constant temperature.  The noise of the units were no louder than a typical air conditioner in a hotel room.The 10,000 unit seemed to push more air, but the 12,000 unit seemed to push colder air.  The difference was very minute to me.I would recommend the Honeywell Portable Air Conditioners to anyone.

"Yes, the audio and video quality is as food as it gets, but the commentaries and introductions from Paul and Ringo are anemic at best. If you're hoping for new insight into the few videos (only 4 or 5) they appear on, you'll be sorely disappointed. The video and audio quality on Ringo's intros looks and sounds like it was shot on a camcorder. Paul's comments don't feature much aside from describing what's on screen, except for the HEY JUDE video, where he gives a very few little nuggets. Anyway, it's wonderful to have all of these films in one collection and the mastering for the videos themselves is marvelous, just wish the ""special features"" were a little more special.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUEODXAXKFXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01576X9J0#wasThisHelpful","R2CUEODXAXKFXQ","AIW1X8G28X7WA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIW1X8G28X7WA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DISCLOSURE: *I received this item at a discount, in exchange for an honest review*I used this screen protector to replace a similar one that I originally purchased from a local brick and mortar store. The old one cost me 4 times more than this one and didn't fit my phone as well, so in that regard, I'm very pleased with this item. It is packaged very well (see my photos in the item's listing) and is made from real glass, not cheap plastic. It includes a wet and a dry cleaning wipe to prepare your screen and remove fingerprints. There is also a ""dust removal"" sticky tab, but it didn't work well and left a residue, so I discarded it and simply used the included wipes. Instructions are provided, but it seems obvious whoever wrote them is not a native English speaker, as they are unclear at best. Thankfully, attaching these things isn't rocket science. The protector attached easily with virtually no air bubble problems. Another nit pick is that it could have been made a few millimeters wider, in order to extend a bit past the iPhone screen. As it is now, the edges align almost exactly with the display screen, which is fine and also how my old screen protector fit.

"I received the new Fire TV on release day after pre-ordering it. Overall I am very happy with it and would rate it 5 stars, but for one problem. It will not play any of my purchased music, it will only play PRIME albums. When I select an album I own outright, it acts as if it's loading, but then nothing happens and the track timer stays at zero. I've attempted to call support and somehow they hung up on me, so now I've just sent them an e-mail and am awaiting a response. Is anyone else having this problem with their purchased music? If I can get this resolved, I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars for sure. Movies and TV shows play perfectly through my wireless connection, so far no buffering issues as I had with the old Fire TV and my older Apple TV. Picture quality is excellent too.UPDATE! - I finally got through to someone in tech support and they solved my issue. I simply had to clear my data for the Amazon Music app and allow my library to reload. I'm including the instructions below:Perform ""clear data"" for the Amazon Music app. Here's how:Go to Settings, select Applications and select Amazon Music and then Clear Data.After performing Clear Data, reboot the device.

"A decent lightweight tripod for your DSLR. It's very versatile with multiple angle adjustments and attachment for your phone and GoPro. I like the quick release snap type adjustments for the leg extensions. The included nylon storage bag is also nice, makes everything very compact and easy to transport.

"This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9” HDX and the new 6”. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, I’ll just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers; comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9” HDX, but I’m happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe it’s because I’m so familiar with the old Fire OS, but let’s just say I’m not blown away be the design so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KERUQ3ZE6R83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKIY9RG#wasThisHelpful","R2KERUQ3ZE6R83","AIW1X8G28X7WA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIW1X8G28X7WA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of Jeffrey Thomas. His writing skills and vivid imagination are second to none and this book is no exception. The dual settings and overlapping storylines are both compelling. I was especially intrigued with the portion of the story that took place in a plastics factory. Why? I don't truly know, but factories and large buildings have always inspired a type of wonder in me. The characters were relatable and felt real, making you concerned for their eventual fates; an absolutely vital ingredient for a horror story to work. The denouement in each parallel tale was satisfying; probably the most difficult part to pull off for any novel, let alone a twofer. The inventiveness of Jeffrey's imagination seems limitless.

"If I had to attempt a description of this novel's plot, I'd say a Michael Crighton medical thriller, shoehorned into a military action tale. Sounds exciting, but unfortunately the writing leaves much to be desired. As with so many self-published novels, it appears that the author has relied on friends and family to edit and critique their work. There is much telling and very little showing. The action and plot are propelled along swiftly, but everything seems to take place in an undefined world, filled with clichéd characters. I have several writer friends and the good ones share their work in writer's groups. Exposing your work to other writers and seeking out unbiased opinions can be painful, but also highly beneficial. This book reads like a decent first draft, but would benefit greatly from some serious rewriting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SWBMUSH5CJCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y5Q39GC#wasThisHelpful","R1SWBMUSH5CJCB","AIW1X8G28X7WA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIW1X8G28X7WA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the opening paragraph of this novel, the spell was cast. Told in the first person by protagonist, Bogdan Bogdanov, this unusual story will entertain you and give you much to think about. Bogdan is a cybernetic scientist, a man fascinated with quantum mechanics, but equally fascinated with the human mind and emotions. The tale of his life is told in the past tense and gradually leads us up to the present. We learn that Bogdan was a gifted child who received special advanced schooling. Eventually his knowledge begins to outgrow the parameters established by his teachers and he becomes an outcast among his peers. Feeling dejected he contemplates drastic measures, but soon meets Lucco Mancini, a financial adventurer of questionable ethics. Lucco introduces Bogdan to the stock market and encourages him to develop an automated system for trading. He complies and the two men form a temporary partnership. Eventually Bogdan tires of the relationship, but it inspires him to create his robot mind, which he calls Semmant. Bogdan takes an apartment by himself and begins working on his Semmant. He shares all of his thoughts and feelings with his creation, in the form of letters. Bogdan also becomes involved in relationships with several women along the way. Each of his experiences become new data that he feeds to Semmant, enhancing the robots intelligence, intellectually and emotionally. Eventually, through a series of mishaps and sexual drama, both Bogdan and Semmant begin to breakdown. The book concludes by taking us back to where it began and providing an explanation of how Bogdanov ended up in his current accommodations. Mr. Babenko writes in what I would call a classic style. At times I was reminded of reading the Russian greats, like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, the language had an almost poetic rhythm to it. In fact, I could well imagine that had one of those gentlemen written a science fiction novel, it might look something like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RYT9U9ZX3FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1QB2FI#wasThisHelpful","R20RYT9U9ZX3FR","AIW1X8G28X7WA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIW1X8G28X7WA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, the book starts off with a quote from Rumi, who I very much appreciate as a fountain of useful living advice, so that was a good start. The author takes insights from teachers like Rumi and others who have reflected on human empathy and mutual understanding and created a concrete process to follow. The goals being to not only better understand our fellow human beings, but also eliminate stress, build resilience, release negative feelings and more. The concept being, the root to accomplishing all of this, is by better connecting as humans. What I appreciate about this book and the process, is that it’s not simply about affirmations or uplifting stories. To make this work, you will need to put it into action in your life. There are study questions at the end of the main content, as well as an extensive list of resources. If you are looking for guidance in interpersonal relationships especially, I would recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E64JPGRAJXAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEFXSZG#wasThisHelpful","R3E64JPGRAJXAQ","AIW1X8G28X7WA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIW1X8G28X7WA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I appreciate what the author has to say in this book, it was difficult for me to follow. The subject bounced around constantly and from character to character, with almost no narrative thread. Each section read like an unedited blog post, as if the writer was simply trying to get their thoughts down, but never went back and attempted to make everything connect.

"No one could disagree that this is a wonderful little tale, with a positive and hopeful message. The story and illustrations are very simple, so I would recommend for young children who are just beginning to learn reading, or who are lucky enough to have parents read to them. One word about the Kindle version (which is what I purchased), it would not open on the PC Kindle app, but looks wonderful on my Kindle Fire. I'm not sure if that's a limitation of the computer version, or something else. However, I would imagine anyone considering this will most likely be reading from a tablet and not a computer monitor, but just in case.

"This was a deeply touching story, written in the first person, as the author experienced the events personally. It is a tale of courage, survival, family connections and most of all love. While there are Christian themes mentioned, anyone would enjoy reading HI-DONG CHAI's story and should take something away from it. Despite all the tragedies related in the book, the author incredibly and admirably maintains a hopeful outlook on life. This is simply a plainspoken narrative, detailing one man's personal feelings and losses caused by war. It is an anti-war treatise, but not in a preachy way. It speaks louder than any essay or fictional anti-war novel, because it's honest and true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QP5VIA0P8MUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4ZU87S#wasThisHelpful","R1QP5VIA0P8MUU","AIW1X8G28X7WA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIW1X8G28X7WA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received these bags free of charge in exchange for an honest review.As with most other reviewers as of this posting, I received these garbage bags for free.  From the best I can tell, unlike other reviewers, I actually tried them.  First, they pretty small.  Not many people have this small of a trash bag in their kitchen, unless it's a side trash bag not the main one.  Secondly, they are NOT very strong.  A corner of a cardboard box sliding down to the bottom can, and does, tear them.  Third, they are not tapered or reinforced at the top, and have no drawstring - hence, they do not stay up when any weight (ie, trash) is added (in our bathroom can, which is small enough to make it fair.)Not sure what's going on with others, but our main bags are Costco kitchen bags (13 gallon, so quite a bit bigger), but the quality different between the two is astronomical.

If you only put in paper, tissues, and nothing of weight, then perhaps, but that's not what most people put into their kitchen garbage cans.  Upon opening these, it was abundantly clear that they would not hold up - and a simple test of putting a small box with corners in it proved the fact - they rip, and they rip easily.I'll be using these in an office trash can where most items are small food wrappers and papers, which is really the only place these should be used.

"I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.This is a terribly odd (and cheap feeling) product that, despite it's quirks, works for its purpose.  The product pictures match - mostly - at the top of the device, there's actually a company name that's essentially random letters glued on, and they're not glued on with any precision (or, seemingly, order.)  The box brags of things like ""Wrieless"" and then, on the side, they figure out how to spell ""wireless"" but in a context of ""Wireless Digital Cord.""  I am speechless attempting to determine what a wireless digital cord is, but I'm glad, I think, that's it's not a wired analog cord.As far as function - it seems to work, but it's not anything special.  For the price (around 18 dollars right now), there are other products on the market that do the same thing - you mostly just need to get lucky with a Chinese product like this, or spend more for a name brand product that has a Quality Control department.

Along with ""Gerun,"" which is the brand name from what I can tell, and ""Originalism derived from life.""I'm not sure if this is Engrish at it's finest (and again, embossed into leather) or some poor, lonely artist-type describing his thoughts to the world, but it's weird.As far as the rest of the pack is concerned, it's well built, looks nice, roomier than it looks, and is pretty versatile.  For instance, it can have a shoulder strap (single) by attaching it to the back - or, as pictured, you can unzip the back compartment to expose the dual shoulder straps (like traditional backpacks), velcro the back lining to the top, and it converts into what a normal backpack would look like.All in all, it's quite the nice pack, and if you were to compare it to the price of a name brand (jansport, nike, etc) for a comparable size/quality pack, it'd likely be about double the price.

On the other hand, after two chapters in, a 10 year old that was excited about the book originally was completely interested.The author does use some oddly worded sentences at times, and tends to be a bit wordy.  And during an early chapter, the number of times ""the boy"" and ""Rodrigo"" were referenced was comically ridiculous.

Entry level with a couple nice things about it that still doesn't push it over the top.  The ability to ""zoom"" is the selling feature of this, though I was somewhat unimpressed with the results.

"I received this headlamp free of charge in exchange for an honest review.This is a very bright headlamp.  Because of the overall power of the light, you do have to make other sacrifices, namely in comfort and weight.  Powered by two 18650 batteries, these are the same powerful batteries that power laptops!  They're great batteries and not overtly heavy until themselves, but when you compare them with the size and weight of a couple skimpy AAA batteries, they're certainly bigger.  Secondly, the lamp area itself is metal - quality metal that after being on a while gets a bit warm (goes to show you how powerful the light is.)  And the metal itself isn't as light as cheap plastic of other headlamps, obviously.So what you're getting here is a very bright light, powered by some powerful batteries, and that takes a small toll on the overall comfort.  It's by no means uncomfortable and never slid off my head or anything, but its certainly something to consider.  Having it on for 30+ minutes may be more uncomfortable with modification (adding padding towards the front), and wearing it for over an hour almost necessitates adding some extra comfort.That out of the way, if you're looking for a great light, this is it.  The zoomable portion of it always you to twist the blue light part which brings the light closer and closer to a magnifying glass; at it's sharpest, it produces are square beam of light; zoomed ""out"" all the way is a large circle of light.  Either one easily light a very large room.All in all, knowing what you're getting with this headlamp is probably most important.  I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone that wants to use it to read in bed for an hour each night - too bright and not comfortable.  For folks that need a bright light for safety, for instance, I would highly recommend this light.It's awesome that it comes with 3 charging cables in the box - USB, car cigarette adapter, and AC adapter.  However, the OTHER end of each of those cables is a tiny circular connection.  I would have highly preferred it had it been a standard microUSB cable - those things can do like 2.5amps, so I don't think it would have been difficult to charge the batteries.  But basically, once I lose or the 3 cables are damaged, the headlamp is less valuable.  (Lucky for me, however, I have 18650 battery chargers for my flashlights, so I could charge them independently.)All in all, a great light for a very reasonable price (20 bucks, currently) - the batteries themselves aren't cheap if you buy them separately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4D8FQY7BNF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AT98BU#wasThisHelpful","R1W4D8FQY7BNF2","A3VBXQKRM7A4JR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBXQKRM7A4JR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free of charge in exchange for an honest review.I was pretty interested in this watch to give to a kid - it's simple and somewhat creative so that the kids can be ""cool"" when wearing a watch.

"I received this flashlight free of charge in exchange for an honest review.I have a lot of flashlights, my favorite of which are the Fenix brands; the Fenix TK35 and Fenix Flashlights TK75 are my go-to flashlights.  But I'm not one to turn down competitors, so I got this one, too!And what we have here is a knock-off flashlight that isn't bad by itself, but when compared to quality flashlights, doesn't get close.  The ""List Price"" of $129 is a farce; apparently they're attempting to show what a great deal you're getting because the ""real"" price is $89 - but wait, it's on sale! Now only $35...  I wouldn't spend more than about $25 on this light.It's a poor choice for a gift because it comes with no box, instructions - nothing at all.  Just a flashlight and charger (no battery) in a padded envelope.  The light itself isn't horrible, but also isn't as bright as the lesser rated lumen lights I have.  The zoomability is OK - there's a magnifying glass over the light and twisting the top gets the light closer/further from the glass.  It works-ish, but when zoomed ""out,"" you lose a good amount of luminosity.It's not a horrible flashlight despite what I've mentioned here - and for the price, it may just be a bit overpriced.

"I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.I love the concept of these bug repellent / air fresheners.  Something natural that isn't laden with chemicals for either the scent or the repelling of the bugs.  They seem to work quite well (no bugs near them, but then again, I didn't have a bug infestation prior, either.)  However, they do have an earthy smell that if you're not expecting it and/or don't enjoy it, then these won't do you much good because it's the scent that's doing all the work.  For me, I don't mind putting these in larger, open rooms with a lot of circulation, but I wouldn't put one in a closet with circulation just because the scent doesn't appeal to me that much.

"I use hearing protection when working with power tools, which is fairly regularly.  I've always hated earplugs, and thus have used ear muff hearing protection.  My usual ones, Howard Leight 1030110 Sync Noise-Blocking Stereo Earmuff have been great - pretty comfortable, reasonable sounding audio, and, of course, great noise reduction.These 3M one up them in a couple ways.  First, they're wireless (or wired, if you really want to use a wire), so that's a first big plus.  Second, they feel like they're made more for daily use; they're rugged and well built.  However, their strong build does lead to one downfall - they're not quite as comfortable as the Howard Leight - mostly because this 3M set is rather rigid on the head band and doesn't provide much padding there.  I could likely rig something up, but I don't use these often enough to figure that out.  Then again, perhaps they need to ""break in"" a bit.  The strong band does, however, ensure that the ear muffs stay over your ear and don't like around (exposing your ear) while you're working.Overall, these are quite nice with good audio, very easy bluetooth setup, and a nice set of features (FM radio, easy to use dials/buttons even with gloves on, etc) that make these hearing protectors an excellent product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K2DK2W5H9SQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146A4SWA#wasThisHelpful","R2K2DK2W5H9SQF","A3VBXQKRM7A4JR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBXQKRM7A4JR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall:  this is a good product with a terrible product description.Turns out, this is actually the ""Shakira"" licensed kids toy.  Shakira, as in, the Americanized pop singer from Columbia, if you're not familiar with her.  For the most part, most baby toys are coming with a Spanish option, most likely to save money at the company so they can put out 1 product for all the Americas, rather than 2, one for N America and a different one for Central and South America.  We've been fine with that.However, we don't - and likely aren't - going to be teaching our kid Spanish.  Most toys don't force Spanish on you, but for this toy, Spanish is at the fore front.  If you're aware of that and are actively looking to teach your kid, it's probably a great learning device to do that.  If you want to teach your kids English and then another language...this may not be the best approach.For the flash cards themselves - good quality, same with the bucket.

"I'm used to my favorite headset, a pair of several-year-old noise cancelling Audio Technica headphones.  Over the years, I've stuck with them because nobody has been able to beat (or even match) the sound quality.  Then again, I hadn't tried V-MODA.These V-MODA headphones sound excellent - very clear sound reproduction and not just a big headphone with a big driver that produces big bass, like many companies decide to make these days.  These certainly have bass, but it's not their only or main goal - the main goal, which is well done, is excellent audio.  The audio is excellent, but they didn't stop there.These are some of the most comfortable headphones I've used as well.  While they advertise and military grade durability and ""steel flex"" and such, it was a bit concerning that they might be a victim of their own design - durable but uncomfortable.  Again, that's not the case with these; they're big, sound great, and are comfortable to boot!Overall, these are some of the best headphones I've used and likely some of the best on the market.  I never tried using the built in mic because...well, it feels a little odd to talk on the phone with high end headphones and the thought never occurred to me to try.

"Don't get the 3 stars wrong - there's nothing blatantly wrong with this heated throw or anything.  But it's kind of average...  except for the price, which is WAY above average (89 MSRP, selling for about 72 at time of this review.)I've owned a couple heated blankets, throws (and even socks!) before, and they each have their pros and cons.  This one is really middle of the road overall.  The big plus this Serta has over other ones I've tried is how soft is it - others that I have (including the cheap ""Sunbeam"" or whatever) isn't nearly as soft and at times you don't even want it to touch you.  This one is very different - even if it wasn't heated, it still feels great!However, comparing it to whatever brand that Costco sells each year - well, the Costco one is much larger than this, not quite as soft but is fine by itself, and twenty bucks cheaper.  For my money, this Serta one loses - I can tuck a bigger blanket away if I only want part of me covered, but I can't stretch a small one when I need a big one.  The Costco one also beats this one by how quickly it warms up (very fast.)  However, the Costco one (at least the ones we've had) not only get hot (and hotter than this Serta), but ""smell"" hot, as in something may be a bit too hot.  It's never given us an issue one we realize that it's just getting very hot and we should probably turn it down anyway...All in all, this is an OK heated throw - if you really want a smallish blanket to cover your shoulders or your lap/legs and you want it very soft and cuddly, this may be what you're after.  If you're going after the most bang for your buck - you might want to shop around or wait until the sales start.Completely unrelated to the product but for some reason Serta thought it was quality marketing material:  what's up with the guy in the product photo's sitting the couch, cup in his hand, the controller for this unit in his other hand.  I'm not sure if his expression is smugly puzzled or modestly inquisitive, but the controls are very simple - press the button to your desired temperature then leave it alone.All in all, another product in a crowded product space that doesn't really do anything differently except cost more.  Good by itself, its weaknesses show when compared to the competition.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CAN2B8D5NIAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHIZ52#wasThisHelpful","R2CAN2B8D5NIAV","A3VBXQKRM7A4JR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBXQKRM7A4JR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to leave a bad review for USA Pans, as this is our 4th baking pan from them (cookie sheet, cake pan, and round pan) that we got because all of the other ones are absolutely the best pans we've ever used.This pan is barely better than the sub 10 dollar pan you can find at a big box store.  Our brownies never slid right out of these.  Our first attempt was no grease, no flour - based on experience with other pans, it was never needed.  We've broiled cheese (somewhat accidentally) onto the cookie sheet and it came off with a damp sponge.  Anyway, our second attempt was oiling each well, which did no better but did leave the brownie bottoms glistening in grease.  Third attempt - grease and flour - and again, we had to dig the brownies out.Perhaps our favorite brownie recipe just isn't well suited for this (brownies from scratch, not out of a box.)

"I bought these just wanting to be able to make my own rounded eggs to slap on an English Muffin for quick breakfast on the go.  And, they work fairly well.  I found that it works best to slowly put the egg in rather than dumping it quickly (and moving this rather lightweight circle.)  The little wire/arm thing that I think is supposed to be used to pull the gadget up when the egg doesn't need it anymore doesn't have enough rigidity to actually stay up, and routinely falls into the pan and heats up.As a whole, these do the job as intended.  For the price, they're not awful, but I did find that I use a maximum of 2 at a time, and it does slow down egg cooking a bit, but for on the go, it's nice to have everything a standard size instead of following out everywhere.

That said, I'm running with the assumption that the content is the same but packaging is different.  And if that's the case, the best reason to use this is that it smells great.  OK, that's maybe not the best reason, but it's the first reason that will come to mind.  When using it, you'll notice that it essentially works as an occasional super-charged conditioner, which as a whole, it quite nice.

"I received this free of charge in exchange for an honest review.For a kids toy/coin bank, this is a fun way to count the coin savings.  It's not terribly accurate (put a quarter in too slowly, and it'll register as a nickle - and then a quarter, for example.)  It could certainly have used some smarter circuitry and sensors to know what you put in and when you put it in.  Also, putting the coins in isn't as simple as just dropping them in - they do need a fair amount of force to put them into the bank.The negatives aside, as long as you're not using this to actually count coin totals with utmost of accuracy, this is a fun way to get kids to save up their change.  The display is big enough, it works well as long as you put the coin in quickly, and the coins remain visible - something that kids like to see.

This Gardenite ratcheting pruner helps to hold the larger branches in place and not squeeze the life out of the branch, pruner, and your hand in one swoop - but most notably (to me, at least) is the ease of cutting through branches larger than 1"", where the Felco ones like to max out at.All in all, I'll keep using these ones for larger jobs, and my Felco ones for smaller ones - and I'd recommend doing something similar, as they do solve two different needs.

"I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.Luseta knows how to create some great hair products!  We've also tried their similar shampoo and conditioner combination, Luseta Argan Oil Moisture & Repair Shampoo Shampoo & Conditioner, which like this Keratin shampoo and conditioner smells great and leaves hair soft and feeling airy and lightweight.For us, using these products on a variety of people and hair types (kids, adults, ""ethnic"" hair, etc), we didn't notice a ton of difference between the two products (except the scent.)  Then again, we don't really have ""damaged"" hair, and were simply expecting clean, soft, full and manageable hair - which is exactly what we got!  My biggest/only negative towards this is that we generally prefer products that we eat or use on our body to be sourced by as few ingredients as possible, and as many of the ingredients to be natural.

I figured I should read it, and felt the same way - for almost half of the book.  For the first half of the book, chapter and chapter is basically telling the same stuff about the main character in different ways, and trying to set up some excitement for when something does happen.  It just takes a long time to actually get there.The rest of the story gets better, but even when (small spoiler here.......) ...even when the ship gets ""lost,"" it takes way too many chapters explaining what's going on rather than something driving the action and story.

"As far as flavor goes, this is pretty good tea.  It's not as strong as I'd hope (sometimes I use two bags; sometimes I let it steep for an hour or so in an insulated car mug to get it stronger), but the flavor is still nice.  For a box of organic tea, it's a large quantity for the price, which makes it worthwhile to buy it in bulk here.It does have some problems.  When pouring hot water onto the box, with some bags lose A LOT of their insides, and you end up with all the green tea and mint making some murky water floating on top.  Sometimes the string isn't fully fastened and it pulls out all the way...  and even better, sometimes the staple that closes the bag and holds the string didn't go through all the way.  As far as the ""tea delivery"" system goes, this stuff pretty much fails - there's another tea brand that doesn't use strings, tags, or staples, which is way better than this.  Yogi tea uses a string and tag, but no staple, which is a little better.  This way (bag with staple, string, and tag) is probably the worst method that's still being used.For the tea, it's great and recommended.

The biggest one for us is that it's a 2-person job to actually get it on - so for the stay-at-home mom, the idea of heading to the store with your little one and walking around hands free is rather hindered by the fact that it's incredibly difficult to get this one with only one person.Once it is on and the kid is in, it's pretty comfortable and the baby doesn't seems to enjoy it, but it feels like it could use a bit more support where the kids' butt is - something that could latch around a chest to keep the child from sinking into the weight of its own rear end.  Outside of that, we like this carrier and it works well when both parents are around to help each other out.

"I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review.As an emergency shovel, this will certainly do the job - once or twice.  The shovel is quite small, but would certainly be helpful in cases that nothing else is available.  The handle actually separates (unscrews) to become easier to store - which is the first problem.  Not that screwing a handle to make it longer is a big deal, but the threads on the screw had signs of corrosion/rust on them out of the package - before I'd ever used it.  I'm guessing if this is getting wet (or I'm trying to free a car from a recently salted icy road, for example), rust is going to set in pretty quickly.Also, given the side of the handle (short) and shape of the blade (mostly flat), this really should be considered an emergency shovel to stow away in a car - in which case, the unit is a great fit and a good price.  However, the whole ""Camping hiking backpacking gardening tactical army..."" multi use function is vastly overstated.  If you're camping with this and using it, it's not going to last long unless you apply anti corrosion to all exposed metal - AND you're not going to be gardening with it because the size of it wouldn't work well for a shovel for more than a couple minutes - and the shape doesn't lend itself to being used as a trowel.All in all, it's an inexpensive shovel that I'd certainly recommend for part of an emergency kit - but not for everyday use, or even extended use for camping/backpacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSOQH02QNALX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016APTV7G#wasThisHelpful","R1BSOQH02QNALX","A3VBXQKRM7A4JR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VBXQKRM7A4JR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tried both the beef and the turkey honey brown sugar varieties.  The beef is certainly better, but not without its share of flaws.

It's outer coating is a bit slimier with a rancid-sweet flavor to it that overwhelms any hint of actual mean.

Even bigger than my current favorite kitchen towels, All-Clad Textiles 100-Percent Cotton Solid Kitchen Towel...and while they're not quite as absorbent, for the price, I'd probably spring for these given my pay grade.The pattern on these is very vivid and looks great - on one side; the other side didn't really get the pattern, so it's ""behind the red lines"" view of the world.

"A grisly discovery at the local dump has the little town of Himmarshee on edge.  Bad enough the poor girl was murdered, but that bondage getup she was wearing has the whole town gossiping (which is something of a pastime in Himmarshee, even during the best of times).This time around Mace Bauer has no intention of getting involved in the investigation.  Mace is working on another kind of investigation – the kind where a cheating husband has her sister feeling heartbroken.  But what if the two things are connected?  Just what the heck is going on these days in sleepy little Himmarshee!This series takes place in the kind of small Florida town that sadly seems headed for extinction.  Light years away from gaudy theme parks and tourist attractions, Himmarshee is a small ranching community.  Mace, her two sisters and their Mama are native Floridians, and proud of it.  I like “cozy” mysteries set in small towns and this one doesn’t disappoint.  There’s a unique sense of place and the characters are simply charming, especially the eponymous ‘Mama’.  The dialog is sharp and witty and I enjoy the banter that goes on between the main characters.  Most of all I appreciate the underlying themes of family, sisterhood and strong women who fiercely look out for each other.The mystery was fairly interesting, though in typical “cozy” fashion it requires that you suspend disbelief.  The side story about Mace’s sister and her marital woes was handled really well – a little humor, but no so much that the infidelity was trivialized.  Overall I think this was a good addition to the series and I hope the author plans to write future installments.Occasional strong language.  While there’s no explicit sexual content, there are some “adult” situations.The series, in order:*Mama Does Time (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Rides Shotgun (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Gets Hitched (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Sees Stars (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Gets Trashed (A Mace Bauer Mystery)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GPT3FLTRYPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738736155#wasThisHelpful","R15GPT3FLTRYPQ","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this fourth series installment the Little Detective Agency (Bernie and his canine partner Chet) are searching for a boy that’s gone missing after an overnight camping trip.  With Bernie’s smarts and Chet’s nose this case should be solved in no time, right?  Well, not exactly.  Things get complicated, and Chet’s got to do a little independent thinking (not his specialty).If you’re not familiar with this series, Bernie Little is a slightly down-on-his-luck private detective and Chet – a self-described “hundred pounder” – is his partner.  Chet (aka “Chet the Jet”) narrates the story, and therein lies the charm of this series.  Chet doesn’t magically solve crimes on his own, we get his interpretation of what’s going on and that’s often pretty hilarious.The mystery itself is well thought out, though the “bad guys” would be right at home in your typical “made-for-TV” movie.  The best characterization is saved for Bernie and Chet, which is fine by me.  The plot moves along at a nice clip (like Chet himself!), and the dialog is nicely done.  This is not edge-of-your-seat suspense, but there’s enough going on here to keep a mystery reader engaged and entertained.Do I read these stories for the mystery?  Not really.  I read these books because Chet’s narrative is charming and clever and, as a lifelong dog lover, it rings true to me.  Ever wonder what your dog is thinking?  Apparently Spencer Quinn knows.  The mutual respect and love that Chet and Bernie share is heartwarming and reading one of these stories always leaves me feeling just a little bit better about life in general.I don’t recall much in the way of swearing or strong language and there’s no sexual content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y4RW0CSB4CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143915709X#wasThisHelpful","R10Y4RW0CSB4CY","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read a lot of “cozy” mysteries and thought the premise of this one sounded good.  We have a young widow (Bella Jordan) and her 5 year old son who find themselves in the charming, albeit somewhat odd, town of Lily Dale, New York.  The tiny town is home to psychics and mediums and during the summer season it’s also a tourist magnet.  Bella arrives in Lily Dale shortly after the death of a woman who owned and operated a small Bed and Breakfast.  Bella agrees to take over the helm in the short term; just until the woman’s heir can find a replacement.  Strange happenings ensue, and Bella becomes embroiled in a murder mystery.While this one had all the right ingredients – a down on her luck heroine, unique locale, and quirky characters – it fell kind of flat for me.  While the writing is technically competent, the Third Person present tense wasn’t a wise choice in my opinion.  It kept me from feeling any connection to Bella and left me feeling annoyed with her repetitive inner dialog.  I felt bored for long stretches of the storyline as Bella was pretty much stalled in a state of grief (completely, 100% understandable but it doesn’t make for entertaining reading).  The potential (future) love interests are rather unceremoniously dumped into the plot and I can already see the makings of a protracted “love triangle” that will no doubt be a running theme as the series continues.While this story didn’t really work for me, it does have some great things going for it.  I think the town of Lily Dale has a lot of potential for further series installments – it’s a fantastic location and the author does a good job of bringing it to life.  Using a Bed & Breakfast as a setting allows for lots of interesting plot and character variations, and I’m assuming Bella’s grief will be downplayed and the focus will be more on her “fresh start” in Lily Dale.Bottom Line:  A “cozy” with a unique setting, but it’s definitely not breaking any new ground.  It was OK, but didn’t pique my interest enough to make me want to read any future installments.I don’t recall much in the way of strong language/swearing and there’s no sexual content.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2XA069LDYCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532487#wasThisHelpful","R2E2XA069LDYCA","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this story is that two complete strangers, Richard and Elizabeth, are offered one million dollars to do nothing more than spend two hours a week together for one full year.  They don’t know anything about the person making the offer – the whole transaction is handled by an attorney – nor do they have any idea why the offer is being made.Richard is a 29 year old wanna be movie producer who is dead broke and barely scraping by; Elizabeth is a thirty-something attorney whose life revolves around work (and little else).  Neither one can pass up the opportunity to split a million bucks, so they agree to the proposal.  If you think you know what happens next you’re probably  right, though there are some interesting twists to the story.I’m a little torn on this one.  I like the author’s writing style – it’s very engaging and witty and he has a keen eye for characterization.  The dialog comes off as effortless (and you know that takes some work!).  I am also struck by how the city of Los Angeles becomes a character in its own right; he does an excellent job of bringing the city to life. So that’s the “good”…now for the not-so-good:I never warmed up to the main characters, particularly the man-boy Richard.  Richard is the type of guy that will be described as “boyish” when he’s 45.  It’s mentioned about two dozen times that he’s extremely good-looking.  In fact, his physical beauty is dwelled on so much that I started to get annoyed.  I get it – he’s gorgeous (even by L. A. standards).  Got it.  Check.  Can we move on already?  Elizabeth is slightly more relatable, though she remains somewhat wooden throughout most of the story.The story itself was…fine.  It’s pure fantasy but I was intrigued by the “mysterious benefactor” and the motivation behind the offer, and that kept me turning the pages.  I’m not sorry I read this one, but it’s not a story that I’ve thought about since reaching “The End”.Occasional swearing/strong language; no sexual content.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRQ3IQ50SBLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062391623#wasThisHelpful","R3HRQ3IQ50SBLS","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that appearance-wise this is your basic, nondescript, black carry-on bag.  It is however extremely well put together and made to last.  The nylon material is sturdy and the zippers are heavy duty (though they glide easily).  The bag zips open to one main compartment with a hard shell bottom.  There’s a smallish interior zip compartment with Tumi’s ‘ID Lock’ to protect encoded data on your credits cards, etc.  There’s also an exterior zip pocket, removable shoulder strap and combination lock.I like the size of this bag – it’s not too large for an overnight trip but I can also easily pack enough for 2-3 days if I need to.  While there’s no doubt that this is a quality item, I confess the price (currently over $300) is a bit of a shock.

"I like to use  toner as part of my evening skin care routine; it ensures that my cleanser has done its job and no traces of make-up have been left behind.  This toner is alcohol-free, non-drying and pleasant to use.  There’s a subtle fragrance – nothing overpowering – and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  There is no residual “sticky” feeling and I’m able to apply my night cream within a minute or two.  I’ve experienced no irritation, redness or breakouts.  My skin type is normal with a slightly oily t-zone and this product does not leave my skin with that tight, dry feeling.While I like this product very much, I’d pause before spending $18 (current price) on a toner.  It’s not that I think the price is outrageous (it falls in the mid-range), but toner is just not one of those skin care items that I’m likely to splurge on.

"I have “normal” skin with a slightly oily t-zone, and this cleanser works very well for me.  You need only a tiny amount – less than pea-sized – to work up a creamy lather on your face and neck.

The product has a very light, barely-there fragrance that I find pleasant (it doesn’t linger once you’ve rinsed your face).  I’ve experienced no redness, irritation, dryness or breakouts.There’s nothing too impressive about the ingredient list – pretty much what you find in most mid-range cleansers.

"“…but somewhere in my twenties I feel like I got stalled in the process and now I’m drifting, marking time without any great passion to move forward.” – Page 227Oh Stephanie, how insightful of you!  You have been stalled.  When I first met you in 1994’s “One for the Money” you were a 30-something single woman who barely scraped by on the money she earned as the world’s most inept bounty hunter.  Now here we are, over 20 years later and you’re still in your 30’s, still in over your head in a job that you have no qualifications for and still waffling between the two men in your life.  But I won’t judge – if I had been given the opportunity to stay in my 30’s forever I can’t say I wouldn’t have jumped on it (and Joe too, while I was at it!)While I found the early Plum books to be fresh and funny with a blue collar heroine that I was happy to root for, I now only read the books out of nostalgia.  The plots are recycled and the characters have grown stale.  I just finished this book and couldn’t tell you what it was about; I’ve already forgotten the details.  Something about Ranger and polonium and a trip to Atlantic City.  Joe gets jealous, Grandma Mazur goes to a funeral, Lula is busting out of her spandex and a couple of cars get trashed.  You know the drill.I won’t even try to tell you that this is a “good” book, but I still enjoyed it.  Why?  Because even recycled Plum is good for a laugh, and because every time I pick up one of these books I’m immediately transported back in time to the 1990’s and I remember how delighted I was to find a heroine that I could totally relate to.If you’re new to the series then book #21 is not where you want to start.

"The allure of a BB cream is that (in theory) it’s a beauty multi-tasker, combining foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen in one product.  In reality I have yet to find one that does all three things well, though this Vichy Idealia BB cream comes darned close.This product can be worn over your moisturizer or on clean, bare skin.  Its primary purpose is to provide UVA/UVB protection (SPF 25) along with sheer coverage.  So, the big question is…will it replace your moisturizer and foundation?  The answer is a definite “maybe” – it all depends on your skin type and how much coverage you’re looking for.My skin type is normal with a tendency to be a bit oily in the t-zone.  This product provides enough moisture for my skin (but keep in mind that my skin is not dry).  The coverage is sheer – this is not going to conceal any significant discolorations or skin imperfections, though it will warm up your complexion and even out the skin tone.  It has a very moist, dewy finish – a little too “dewy” for my oil-prone t-zone, but a little bit of pressed powder fixed that.  It has a very light scent and has the same consistency as foundation make-up.  It smooths on easily and blends in well.My thoughts:I do like this product and find that it’s perfect for days when I’m going to be outdoors a lot and need dependable sun protection.  The dewy finish leaves my skin looking a bit too shiny so I need to use a touch of powder (though drier skin types probably won’t have that issue).  It’s non-irritating and feels light on my skin.  While it’s supposed to work for all skin types, I’d recommend that those with oily or acne-prone complexions proceed with caution – that dewy finish may not be what you’re looking for.Active sunscreen ingredients:*Homosalate*Octisalate*Octocrylene*Titanium Dioxide","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLS0PT5SO5C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CE15US#wasThisHelpful","RTLS0PT5SO5C9","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earrings are really very pretty in person, however they are not as “sparkly” as pictured on the product page.  The stone is cut so that a lot of the surface is flat, and they don’t reflect light in a way that creates a lot of sparkle.  That said, they are a lovely deep purple color and large enough to be noticed (these are not teeny-tiny stud earrings).The earrings are lightweight and don’t feel heavy on my earlobe.  They fit nice and snug – comfortable but secure.  The two-tone setting is versatile; these pair nicely with either yellow or white gold jewelry.Bottom Line:  For under $35 (current price) you get a lot of bang for your buck.

"A movie crew filming a Western has descended on Himmarshee and Mace is in charge of the horses.  While Mace sees this as an opportunity to earn a few extra bucks, Mama sees this as her big break - finally, a shot at stardom (not)!  But the movie is plagued with problems, not the least of which is the murder of the executive producer.  The man was so widely disliked that the question isn't ""who had a reason to kill Norman Sydney?"" but rather ""who DIDN'T have a reason to kill him?""This book was a lot of fun!  The usual crew is on board - Mace and Mama, sisters Maddie and Marty, and Mace's on again/off again love interest, Carlos.  In addition to the ""usual suspects"", there's the Hollywood contingent:  a drugged out starlet, a gorgeous actress, an aging leading man and assorted other eccentric characters.  There are plenty of suspects to go around; more than enough to keep an armchair sleuth on their toes.  But the real fun is all the bickering/bantering going on between Mama and ""her girls"" - I enjoy the way the author keeps the dialog fresh, funny and engaging.  There's also a great sense of place - small town Himmarshee comes to life in all its humid glory.This is the fourth book in the series and I've enjoyed them all very much.  I do have one small gripe though...enough with Mace and Carlos already!  Jeez, these two act like they're in 9th grade and their ""on again/off again"" relationship is getting stale.  Reading about those two and their complete inability to communicate like adults was the one sour note in the book for me.  I sure as heck hope they gain some maturity by book five!Very little (if any) strong language and no explicit sexual content.

"This 7th installment in the series kicks off with a grisly discovery:  the body of a man is found in the woods on the outskirts of St. Denis, and the cause of death is far from ""natural"".  Complicating the investigation is the return of Sami, a young man from St. Denis who had become entangled with Islamic extremists and is thought to have ties with known terrorist groups.  Is Sami just an unwitting pawn that was exploited because of his uncanny talent with electronics or is there something more going on....Where to start with this one?  Let's start with the good stuff first.  I found the central plot very compelling.  Sami is an autistic young man who spent a good chunk of his childhood in St. Denis.  Bruno feels that he knows Sami, and yet do we ever really know what another human being is capable of?  I like the way the author explored that issue.  There's also a storyline involving a bequest made to St. Denis by wealthy siblings who escaped capture by the Nazis when they were sheltered by a local farmer and his wife.  This was a touching story based on real-life events and I found it very moving.This book had more of a Spy/Action Thriller feel than the previous books in the series and I'm not sure that I'm 100% on board for that.  I like the ""Bruno"" series because of the underlying themes of community and loyalty; I like the portrayal of Bruno as a small town policeman with an innate sense of justice whose approach to law enforcement is colored by common sense, decency and respect for the people of his community.  In this book we see Bruno as something of a superhero, a Ramboesque action figure if you will.  I wasn't thrilled with that, and frankly the ending of this story devolved into a kind of B-Movie action sequence that had me rolling my eyes.I'm a little torn on this one.  The story was compelling and well written, but I missed the down-to-earth Bruno from the previous novels.  Part of the appeal of this series for me is the charming portrayal of small town life, and that was mostly missing from this novel.  Then again, I did find this to be a page-turner, so it would be unfair to say the book was just ""OK"" simply because it departed from the formula a bit.  Hmmm....it's precarious sitting up here on this fence!  I'll call this a 3.5 rounded up to 4 for Amazon.Occasional strong language, some descriptive violence, no explicit sexual content.

"I’m a sucker for “cozy” mysteries set in the south.  An old plantation in Cajun country that’s been turned into a Bed & Breakfast?  A small town populated with quirky characters?  Yep, you can count me in!  While “Plantation Shudders” wasn’t an unequivocal hit for me, there was a lot that I liked about the story and I think this series has plenty of potential.Thirty-something Maggie Crozat is at loose ends.  Broken-hearted (as well as just plain broke!) she left New York and returned home to Pelican, Louisiana.  Working as a plantation tour guide and helping out in the family owned Bed & Breakfast helps pay the bills while she figures out what to do next.  With finances being somewhat precarious, Maggie and her parents are thrilled when the B & B is booked solid for and end-of-summer food festival.  Unfortunately, the thrill is gone all too soon when two guests die under suspicious circumstances, and Maggie hopes to save the family business by finding out whodunit.I thought the author did a good job of creating a sense of place – I could easily picture the plantation house as well as the town of Pelican.  I didn’t particularly warm up to the character of Maggie, and I’m not sure why.  It could be that she seemed more like a twenty-something who is still trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up than a woman in her thirties.  I liked the character of Maggie’s grandmother, who provided comic relief.  The stereotypical bumbling small town cops and the buffoonish chief of police were disappointing (yawn) and I would like to have seen something more imaginative.  The love interest felt forced and contrived – everything fell into place too easily.The mystery was standard “cozy” fare:  lots of suspects and plenty of convenient coincidences.  I think the suspect list should have been pruned down a bit – I felt like there was a cast of thousands!Despite all my picayune complaints, I did actually like this story.  The writing is smooth and professional and the author has set the scene for an enjoyable “cozy” series.  The B & B offers endless plot possibilities and Pelican sounds like a charming little place.  The first book in a series can be tricky – you get a whole cast full of characters thrown at you all at once and it can be hard to get a feel for any of them.  If there’s a second book I’d definitely be willing to give it a chance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36GFAC19S5IXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532509#wasThisHelpful","R36GFAC19S5IXU","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toothpaste more or less covers all the bases:  anti-cavity, freshens breath, etc.  I feel pretty neutral about it – it gets the job done but nothing about it makes it stand out from other toothpastes as far as I’m concerned.  I do like that the flavor is not overly sweet and that the texture is not unpleasantly gritty.This toothpaste does contain triclosan which seems to be somewhat controversial but apparently has been shown to reduce gingivitis.

"I’ve tried Burt’s Bees products before, but this skin care trio is the first time I’ve used the products consistently.  I’m really impressed with the quality of this skin care line, especially given its affordable price tag.  I’m middle-aged and my skin is “normal” with a tendency to be a bit oilier in the t-zone.  Here are my thoughts on each product:Deep Cleansing Cream:  Love this stuff!  This is a true “cream”, and a dime-size amount is enough to cleanse your face and neck – a little goes a long way.  It does not produce a lather, but it does a thorough job of cleansing your skin, including removing make-up.  It’s got a bit of a menthol type smell but it’s not overpowering.  It doesn’t leave my skin with that tight, overly dry feeling – just soft and clean.  It’s 100% natural and I didn’t experience any redness or irritation.Towelettes:  Not impressed.  These don’t do a great job of removing make-up; even my non-waterproof mascara doesn’t budge.  These are probably best just to refresh your skin in a pinch after a work-out, or they might be OK for those who don’t wear make-up.  On the plus size they are super gentle and non-irritating.Daily Moisturizing Cream:  This product is perfect for my skin.  Just simple, lightweight moisture that absorbs right in with no sticky feeling.  Works great under make-up and is 100% Fragrance Free.The only thing that stops this skin care trio from being 5 stars for me is the towelettes, which were a bit of a disappointment.  The cleanser and the moisturizer are products that I will purchase again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JYCFOKWUU9H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ2XA6E#wasThisHelpful","R1JYCFOKWUU9H5","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This conditioner turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  It’s very thick and rich-textured but it rinses clean and doesn’t weigh your hair down at all.  I use a little over a tablespoon on my long(ish) hair, applied from mid-shaft to the ends (I don’t need conditioning at the roots).  It leaves my color-treated hair tangle free and lightly moisturized and my hair has plenty of volume when I blow it out.  The light floral fragrance is pleasant and just smells clean and fresh once your hair is dry.I think this could work for a lot of hair types, though if your hair is extremely dry/coarse/damaged you might want something a bit richer.  For a mass-market hair product this is very nice, and the generous 25 ounce size should last a looong time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XD1J9A2D0XD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJUO8#wasThisHelpful","R39XD1J9A2D0XD","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been over a year since Odelia has stumbled across a dead body, but she picked one heck of a time to end her dry spell!  It's Zee's daughter's wedding and everything is just lovely...right up until Odelia runs into the wedding planner.  In the cloakroom.  Dead.Now this time around Odelia has no intention of sticking her nose into police business - uh-uh, no way.  But she is willing to help out a ""friend"" by doing a little digging around in a missing person case.  Is it Odelia's fault that the missing person(s) has a connection to the recently deceased wedding planner?  Of course not, and how much trouble could Odelia possibly get into with her amateur sleuthing?I was going through a little rough patch and found myself desperately in need of an Odelia Grey ""fix"", and this book provided just the distraction that I was craving.  In addition to the delightful Ms. Grey, this story featured the usual cast of ""regulars"" along with a couple of new additions.  The mystery actually felt a little unwieldly, but I don't mind because I read ""cozy"" mysteries primarily for the characterization and this series gets an A+ where that's concerned.Like its predecessors, this installment was loaded with warmth and humor, quirky characters and a heroine that you'd love to have as a best friend.  I love the themes of friendship, loyalty and second chances that permeate these stories, but most of all I guess I just love Odelia Grey.This is the 6th book in a series, and I'd recommend that you start at the beginning with book one: Too Big to Miss (The Odelia Grey Mysteries) .There's little (if any) strong language and no explicit sexual content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BO8OV0ZPGV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141044063X#wasThisHelpful","R15BO8OV0ZPGV8","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As autumn settles into the Dordogne Bruno, chef de police of St. Denis, is looking forward to a quiet spell as the busy tourist season comes to a close.  The usually unflappable Bruno finds himself a bit star struck when he has the opportunity to meet a boyhood hero, a WWII legend and national icon widely known as ""The Patriarch"".  At a party for Marco Desaix (aka ""The Patriarch"") a suspicious death occurs and Bruno's subsequent investigation stirs up a hornet's nest involving long-buried Cold War secrets and political machinations.I was really looking forward to this 8th installment in the delightful ""Bruno"" series, and this book did not disappoint.  I thought the plot was cleverly executed - interesting tidbits about Cold War relations between France and Russia interspersed with Bruno's characteristic common sense and compassionate approach to community policing.  It's always entertaining to observe the interplay between the usual cast of characters and, of course, the village of St. Denis is a character in its own right.  The dialog is beautifully done, seeming so natural and effortless, and there were no lulls in the storyline.And never fear, as with all the previous books in the series we are treated to fabulous meals and yet another wrinkle in Bruno's already complicated love life.  I love the themes of community, friendship and quiet honor that are hallmarks of this charming series, and ""The Patriarch"" did not let me down.As I mentioned earlier, this is #8 in the series and while it does work as a standalone novel I'd highly recommend reading the series in order as the relationships between these characters evolve as the series progresses.  Contains occasional strong language (though mainly in French!) and there's no explicit sexual content.The series, in order:*Bruno, Chief of Police: A Novel of the French Countryside*The Dark Vineyard: A Novel of the French Countryside*Black Diamond: A Mystery of the French Countryside*The Crowded Grave: A Mystery of the French Countryside*The Devil's Cave: A Mystery of the French Countryside*The Resistance Man: A Bruno, Chief of Police novel*The Children Return: A Bruno, Chief of Police novel*The Patriarch: A Bruno, Chief of Police novel**There are also two short stories available on kindle","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4BRXSV46HRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354177#wasThisHelpful","RR4BRXSV46HRT","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I enjoyed the first two entries in this charming ""cozy"" series, I guess the old saying ""three's the charm"" is true because I just flat-out loved this story.Not only is Mama about to take a fifth (!) trip down the aisle, but she's insisting on a full blown ""Gone With the Wind"" themed wedding.  No thirty-something single woman should have to dress up in a Scarlett O'Hara bridesmaid's gown, but Mace is willing to do it to make Mama happy (not to mention that the word ""no"" doesn't seem to register with Mama).  But all the hoop skirts and ruffled parasols have to be put aside when Mama's caterer is murdered on the eve of the big event.  Who would want poor old Ronnie Hodges dead?  Since Mace would rather hunt down a murderer than hear one more word about tulle or party favors, she sets out to find the killer.This series is set in a small Florida town on Lake Okeechobee, a far cry from the tourists and theme parks that we usually associate with state.  I love the way the author describes small town life, where gossip is an art form and everyone knows everyone else - for better or worse.  The characters are delightful, from the commitment shy Mace to the (charmingly) manipulative Mama.  The banter between Mace, her two sisters and Mama is priceless.  This story is told with a lot of warmth and humor and it made me miss my own mother who, like Mama, was born and raised in a small Florida town and knew the secret to getting your own way was to lay on the Southern charm with a smidgen of guilt (as needed).Like all series, I'd recommend you start at the beginning, though this does hold up as a standalone novel.  There's little (if any) strong language/swearing and no explicit sexual content.The series, in order:*Mama Does Time (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Rides Shotgun (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Gets Hitched (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Sees Stars (A Mace Bauer Mystery)*Mama Gets Trashed (A Mace Bauer Mystery)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13PV9A7ZL7QZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738719226#wasThisHelpful","R13PV9A7ZL7QZG","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This notebook is definitely an upscale version of the generic spiral notebooks you buy at the drugstore, but those nice features come with a hefty price tag.The sturdy plastic cover will hold up to a lot of abuse and offer some protection from spills.  The fabric covering the spiral binding is a really nice touch – no snagging everything in its path if you’re pulling it out of a backpack!  The moveable divider with pockets on each side is a great feature to help keep you organized.I have nothing negative to say about this product – it’s a well thought out design and the quality is impeccable.

"Wendy Corsi Staub is a prolific writer and I’ve read (and enjoyed) a couple of novels she wrote under the pen name ‘Wendy Markham’.  While I thought the writing in “Blood Red” was polished and professional, as a Mystery/Thriller it missed its mark.I’m going to keep this synopsis vague as I’m leery of wandering into ‘Spoiler’ territory.  The gist of the story is that a happily married, middle-aged teacher (Rowan Mundy) starts getting creepy gifts out of the blue.  The person sending the gifts is anonymous, but has knowledge of an indiscretion committed by Rowan well over a decade ago.  This sends Rowan into a tailspin of anxiety and self-loathing; she doesn’t want her husband to discover her secret so she flails about trying to resolve things on her own which only serves to deepen the hole she’s managing to dig for herself.  Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Rowan, a serial killer with a thing for redheads has her in their crosshairs.By far the best thing this story has going for it is the setting.  Mundy’s Landing is a bucolic village tucked away in New York’s picturesque Hudson River valley.  The town’s one dubious claim to fame is that it was the scene of a series of bizarre (unsolved) murders a hundred years ago, and a virtual cottage industry has sprung up in exploiting the town’s eerie past.  I can see why the author decided to set a new series here – it’s a gold mine!Other than the setting nothing about the story felt unique to me.  The villain came straight out of central casting (cue the scary music!) and Rowan’s constant guilt and angst over her troubled teen years was tedious.  A woman who is nearly fifty years old and has made a very nice life for herself and her family should be able to put some petty juvenile antics into perspective.  And as for that terrible, awful secret that she just has to keep from her husband?  I found it ridiculous.  So Rowan annoyed me, her husband was a cypher, the storyline involving her son was uninteresting and Rowan’s sister was painfully one dimensional.  That about sums it up!Mystery Thriller?  I think not.  There are too many extraneous characters with storylines that go nowhere, and really there were few surprises.  The story stalled too often to maintain any sense of tension and whatever suspense builds up is inevitably offset by page after page of the main character’s tiresome internal monologues.Bottom Line:  Despite competent writing and an intriguing setting this story fails to “thrill” on any level.  Unfortunately there’s nothing new here, folks – you’ve read it all before.  2.5 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPVIKEFCPN3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062349732#wasThisHelpful","RZPVIKEFCPN3U","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there are some beauty products that I’m willing to splurge on, toner isn’t one of them.  I’ve tried dozens of them over the years, from the inexpensive mass market brands that you find at the drugstore all the way up to the pricey boutique brands that you can only buy from an esthetician.  While I’d give a slight nudge to the pricier “professional” brands, for the most part they all seem to perform about the same.  That being said, I’m surprised at how much I like this Phyto 5 toner.I expected a toner that contains both witch hazel and alcohol to be drying, but (surprisingly) this isn’t.  My skin type is “normal”, with a tendency to be slightly oily in the t-zone.  This toner leaves my skin feeling soft and not at all tight, with no sticky feeling whatsoever.  It doesn’t sting or cause any irritation or redness and I’ve been able to incorporate it right into my regular skincare routine, which includes a retinol night cream.  It has a strong medicinal smell reminiscent of poison ivy medication, but that quickly fades.Now to address the elephant in the room…this is expensive!  Prices tend to fluctuate here on Amazon, but right now this in the $50 range.  While I’m impressed with how well this product works for me, I don’t see myself spending that kind of money on a toner.Would I recommend this product?  I think this will work well for oily, normal, or combination skins, but dry and/or sensitive skin types might have a problem with the alcohol.  If you’re not on a strict beauty budget then it’s certainly worth a try.*49.4% of the total ingredients are from Organic farming*99.2% of the total ingredients are from natural origin","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRVUO0CCG93K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB85VV2#wasThisHelpful","R2LRVUO0CCG93K","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, multi-purpose kitchen knife.  It weighs in at approx. 4 ounces; lightweight but with a solid feel.  It’s made from 1.4116 German Steel, which is generally considered to fall into the “medium to good” quality range when it comes to kitchen knives.While this does a fine job of trimming meat and cutting through poultry, I find myself using it mostly for chopping/dicing fruit and veggies.  I like the size and weight of the knife and it slices through even the denser raw vegetables with ease.While it’s listed as dishwasher safe, the manufacturer recommends hand washing.  There’s no such thing as “Stainless” steel – all steel can rust eventually if not well cared for.  As I understand it, 1.4116 German Steel is highly stain resistant.This knife comes very nicely boxed (if you’re thinking of giving it as a gift).  I’m not sure what the price point for this knife is going to be, but I’d expect it to be in the budget-conscious range (as opposed to the high-end brands that carry a hefty price tag).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVTYAAXD30JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFEDTJG#wasThisHelpful","RSVTYAAXD30JF","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My skin is not terribly dry (except in the winter months), but I do apply a light body moisturizer after every shower.  I thought this wet skin moisturizer might be too oily, but it’s surprisingly light textured and doesn’t leave my skin with a tacky, greasy feeling.  You towel dry after you’ve moisturized and you can dress immediately.The sweet floral scent is initially strong, but it fades quickly.  I can barely detect it an hour after I’ve showered – it just smells clean and summery to me.  While I do like this product, I have to laugh at the claim that you can “get ready in  the time”.  How long does it take to put on moisturizer – 20 or 30 seconds?  What difference does it make if I reverse the order by moisturizing before I dry off?  Silly advertising gimmick!Bottom Line:  Nice for people who don’t mind a floral scent and don’t require a heavy-duty moisturizer.  This is a mass-market product that you’d find in a drugstore or supermarket and I’d expect it to be priced accordingly.  The ingredients are nothing special, and the almond and coconut oils fall so far down on the list that there can't be anything but trace amounts of both.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHFBYF13H33Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB87WX2#wasThisHelpful","RHHFBYF13H33Z","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a little late to the `Odelia Grey' party, but I'm making up for lost time by binge reading this delightful ""cozy"" series.  How fun is it that California-based Odelia is in my neck of the woods for this 5th series installment?Odelia plans to spend the long Labor Day weekend by confronting her estranged mother, who she hasn't seen in over 30 years.  Odelia has barely set foot in Massachusetts when she stumbles across a dead body, and it looks like her long-lost mom may have had something to do with the crime.  Instead of getting the closure she was craving, Odelia gets a family she never even knew existed and yet another murder investigation under her belt.This was a fun read.  Characters from previous books make an appearance and we're introduced to a couple of new players that I hope to see more of in future installments.  There's a lot going on in this story, with different mystery subplots that intertwine - there's plenty here to keep an armchair sleuth on their toes!  But at its core this is a true ""cozy"", with the emphasis firmly on the characters and the setting.I love Odelia Grey.  Let's face it, middle-aged, plus-sized women don't typically get the starring role in a mystery series, but Odelia takes center stage and she owns it.  I think a big part of her appeal is that she's something of an `everywoman':  Attractive, but not cloyingly perfect.  She has a job she loves but a boss that gets on her last nerve.  She found her soulmate later in life, but boy was he ever worth the wait!  There's something uplifting about celebrating life's second act instead of worshipping at the altar of youth 24/7.  It's a nice change of pace.If you enjoy ""cozy"" mysteries with female sleuths then I highly recommend this series.  The writing is solid and the author infuses her narrative with warmth and humor.  It's clear that she has a great deal of affection for Odelia, and I think it's contagious.Occasional swearing/strong language.  There's some mild sexual innuendo, but no explicit content.

"I've been bingeing on the delightful ""Bruno"" series, and this 4th installment was chock full of the things that make these books so appealing.  First we have Bruno doing what he does best:  looking out for the citizens of St. Denis when some student activists target local farmers.  Then a dead body is discovered and Bruno switches into ""investigator"" mode, while juggling security duties for a last minute summit between France and Spain.  Phew.  Don't worry though, there's still plenty of time for Bruno to show off his culinary skills, vacillate between the two women in his life and walk his beloved hunting dog, Gigi.I enjoy the way the author reveals more about Bruno's past as the series moves forward.  There's so much that explains his strong attachment to the small town of St. Denis and his fierce need to protect its citizens, who are his family of choice.  These stories are strongly character based, though the mysteries are not simply window dressing (as they are in a ""cozy"" mystery).  There are a lot of layers to this particular storyline, and the mystery kept me completely engaged.  As always the characterization was excellent and the author's vivid descriptions of food and wine had me raiding my fridge in the wee hours of the morning (sadly, I was unable to locate any foie gras or Pomerol, and had to settle for some goat cheese from the supermarket - the shame!).If you enjoy mysteries that have more substance than a ""cozy"" but still focus on all the charming details that bring a locale to life, then I'd recommend this series.  Good, solid mystery storylines that are heavy on the characterization and domestic details and light on the blood and gore.

"...but nobody really wants to deal with an icky nail fungus.Almost a year ago I got a puncture wound to one of my toes and the nail bed was damaged.  As the nail grew back it didn't look quite right - yellowish color, bumps and ridges - so I consulted an expert.  No, not a doctor - my friend that owns a spa!  Diagnosis:  Nail fungus.  She wasn't optimistic.  Seems over-the-counter meds take a long time to work, that's IF they work at all.  There are prescription meds available, but they have side effects.  So...what to do?  Was I doomed to walk around with an ugly nail for the rest of my days?  I live in flip-flops; I wear them from the time the snow melts until the first frost. ""Old Yeller"" has got to go.I've been using Probelle twice a day for nearly three weeks now, and I've seen a big improvement.  The color of the nail is *almost* back to normal and the texture of the nail is much better.  I think the product is definitely working, but I've been doing a few other things as well:*keep the nail as short as you comfortably can*file down the thickness of the nail, but don't get carried away*try to avoid nail polish as much as possible while you're treating the nailWhile I'm very happy with the results, I am experiencing one side effect:  the product is making my skin dry and flaky.  I've been using a vitamin E oil to counteract the dryness, and that seems to work pretty well.  I also don't care for the dropper style applicator - you end up wasting a lot of product and getting it on skin that doesn't need to be treated.  Wouldn't a brush type applicator (like nail polish) make more sense?Bottom Line:  The product is working for me and I plan to continue using it.  The side effects are mild. The product has no odor, dries quickly and you don't need to use a lot of it.  I suspect that results will vary based on the extent of the problem (how many nails are involved) as well as how long you've had the fungus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18N39VMVX775N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8SRV8#wasThisHelpful","R18N39VMVX775N","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 4th entry in the series opens with Odelia enjoying life as a newlywed, sharing a cozy house in Seal Beach with husband Greg and their assorted fur babies.  So all this wedded bliss means Ms. Grey won't be sticking her nose into any more murder investigations, right?  Everyone knows it doesn't count if you're just doing a favor for a friend...A serial killer the press has nicknamed the ""Blond Bomber"" has everyone in the LA area looking over their shoulders.  Over lunch Odelia's friend Lillian drops a bombshell of her own:  she believes the ""Blond Bomber"" is her own son, a prominent plastic surgeon.  Odelia thinks Lil is way off base, and all she agrees to do is prove that Dr. Brian Eddy is not a killer - how dangerous could that be?I'm not going to post any ""spoilers"", but right off the bat I have to say that there's an element to the ""Lillian"" storyline that was downright icky, and I had a hard time getting past it.  Other than that it was a fairly enjoyable connect-the-dots mystery, with suspects aplenty and a red herring (or two) tossed in for good measure.  I think the author telegraphed the identity of the ""Blond Bomber"" a little too early in the storyline, but there were a few surprises tossed in to keep me interested.Just to be clear here - this is a straight-up ""cozy"" mystery, so I'm willing to suspend disbelief when it comes to the investigation.  In real life police do not take kindly to civilians mucking around in murder investigations, nor would most people be foolhardy enough to put themselves in so many potentially dangerous situations.  For me a ""cozy"" is all about the characters, and I thoroughly enjoy spending a few hours with Odelia and company.Odelia Grey is a breath of fresh air in the ""cozy"" genre.  Middle-aged and unapologetically plus-sized, she's confident and her self-esteem is firmly intact.  The series is populated with a charming cast of characters and the author writes with a great deal of warmth and humor.  As with most series, this one is best enjoyed when read in order, so you'll want to start with book one: Too Big to Miss   .  Relax and enjoy!Occasional swearing/strong language; no explicit sexual content","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNL71U4DQEJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738713503#wasThisHelpful","R2RNL71U4DQEJG","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nothing good ever comes from attending a High School reunion, but Odelia's 30th is murder...literally.When the class bully is murdered there is no shortage of suspects.  Donny Oliver was a nasty piece of work, and plenty of people had reason to hate him (including Odelia herself).  Teaming up with an old High School ""frenemy"", Odelia does a little snooping and uncovers a few surprises.  Meanwhile, Odelia's boss has pulled an uncharacteristic disappearing act.  Nobody knows where Mike Steele has gone, but it's starting to look like he may have been involved in something shady.  The man may be a pain, but he's Odelia's pain and she intends to find him...one way or another.This third entry in the series was a bit sillier than its predecessors, and relied quite heavily on what I'd call ""convenient coincidences"" in order to move the plot along.  Still, there was a lot to like about the story.  I love the way the author is developing the characters, especially the supporting cast.  In this book the focus is on Greg and Odelia's relationship, and the friction that's caused by Odelia's penchant for insinuating herself into police investigations and putting herself at risk.I think the author has the right formula for an engaging ""cozy"" series here:  A unique, lovable protagonist that you want to root for, supporting characters that evolve as the series progresses, and a setting that feels realistic and natural.  While I could find plenty to nitpick in the way this story unfolds, I won't.  Why?  Because it really doesn't matter as it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.  A ""cozy"" is all about the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent immersed in Odelia's world.  It's on to book 4 for me - Booby Trap  .If you're not familiar with the series, Odelia Grey is a middle-aged, plus-sized woman who doesn't have an insecure bone in her body.  By day she's a paralegal, but on her own time she has a knack for solving crime.  This is a charming series that doesn't take itself too seriously; there's always room for a laugh (or two) and Ms. Grey is a winner.Some swearing/strong language.  No explicit sexual content.  This is book 3 in the series and probably not the place to start if you're new to the series.  The first book is Too Big to Miss (The Odelia Grey Mysteries) .","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX8GHHGMJFHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073871089X#wasThisHelpful","RTX8GHHGMJFHR","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These microfiber cloths are  great for just about any cleaning task.  They’re ideal for polishing furniture (no lint!) and work well for cleaning glass or mirrors.  The generous 16” x 24” size and absorbent material make cleaning up spills a snap.  I’ve been using these in place of sponges and paper towels and am pleased with how well they work.These can be machine washed and tossed in the dryer on the ‘low’ setting (no bleach or fabric softeners).  Even after several washings and trips thru the dryer there’s no shrinkage and the material hasn’t lost any of its absorbent quality.  As an added plus the design is actually kind of attractive; I keep a couple of these in a basket on my kitchen counter so they’re always handy for a quick clean up.  Very nice – recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCKTM5GZ2D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQ4S2C#wasThisHelpful","R1SCKTM5GZ2D3","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve read most of Marian Keyes’s books (not the last few), and enjoyed them very much.  She has a biting sense of humor and a keen eye for the ridiculous.  Her female characters are often a bit self-absorbed, even a tad shallow, but this just provides fodder for Keyes’s wicked sense of humor.  Take this observation from the novel’s heroine, wistfully recalling the days when she had a personal trainer to keep her fit:“Between that and the running, it kept me a size eight.  A European size eight, I should stress.  Not a US size eight, which is really a size twelve and which nobody admires.”Keyes manages to poke fun at the character and our weight obsessed culture at the same time.  Clever.  That being said, this was not my favorite Keyes book by a long shot.  It had its moments, but overall it missed the mark for me.As the story opens we meet Stella Sweeney, a 41 year old divorced woman who has just moved back to Dublin along with her surly teen-age son.  All we know is that her life is in a shambles, she had obtained –and subsequently lost – some degree of celebrity and now desperately needs to write a book to get herself back on track financially.  The story unfolds as Stella thinks back to when she contracted a scary (and very serious) illness several years ago and how that illness served as a catalyst for her to change her life.  And so it goes, back and forth between past and present until Stella’s story is revealed.I didn’t have an issue with the story being told in flashback sequences per se, but I admit that it made it easy for me to put the book down…frequently.  I just never got engrossed in the story, and I suspect a lot of that had to do with the disjointed narrative.  I also thought the book was too long – there just isn’t enough story here to warrant 400+ pages.  Frankly I found some of it boring, even tedious.While this isn’t a huge departure from the author’s previous works, it lacked something for me, and I think that “something” is a compelling heroine.  Stella Sweeney was just too passive and glib for my taste.  I’m not sorry I read the book, Keyes is a darned fine writer and she can always wring a laugh out of me, but this isn’t a story that I’ll be thinking about days from now – I’m afraid there was just nothing memorable about it for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FGS575AC4E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525429255#wasThisHelpful","R2FGS575AC4E1","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thule has a reputation for producing high quality products, and this daypack does not disappoint.This daypack offers good protection for your laptop and your tablet as well as easy access to both.  The material is rugged and resistant to tearing/ripping.  The zippers are sturdy and glide easily (no need to fumble with them when you’re traveling and need to get at your devices).  The straps are comfortable and the fit can be adjusted fairly easily.  I’m petite and my husband is 6’2”, and both of us use this daypack comfortably.I think this pack is ideal for bike commuters.  It fits flat against your back and feels secure; it’s roomy enough for your “essentials” without being overly bulky.  I also used it as my carry-on luggage on a recent trip and found it roomy enough for a few “extras” (with the main purpose of keeping my electronics protected and easily accessible).  While I’m not a huge fan of the look of the roll top, I have to say that it does allow you a bit of extra room when necessary.I really have nothing negative to say about this product.

"I’ve been meaning to replace my two Teflon coated cookie sheets for ages.  They are scratched and have long since lost whatever non-stick qualities they ever had, and they’re a royal pain to clean.  This Doughmakers cookie sheet puts them to shame.The pebble pattern is not just a gimmick – when they say it allows for “easy release”, they’re not kidding.  Once the cookies had cooled I was able to just lift them off the sheet by hand, no spatula required.  Clean up is super easy, just a quick hand wash (no scrubbing necessary).I did have to adjust the cooking time somewhat when using this sheet.  I found that I needed an extra 4 to 5 minutes of baking time when making a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe (compared to the cook time using my old Teflon cookie sheets).*Use of non-stick spray is NOT recommended*Not recommended for dishwasher*Made in ChinaBottom Line:  A good quality baking sheet that performs well.

"This is a Spoiler-Free review.After spending 40 years as a fugitive, Ian Holzner has decided to turn himself in.  Holzner is accused of being the mastermind behind the 1975 bombing of a VA Center that claimed four lives.  While Holzner admits to being part of the radical anti-war movement, he denies responsibility for the VA Center bombing, and he intends to stand trial.Parker Stern reluctantly agrees to defend Holzner, but finds his client secretive and (for the most part) uncooperative.  What is Holzner hiding?  Is he guilty?  The media circus surrounding this case shines a spotlight on Parker's personal life, but that's the least of his worries - this case is dangerous, and Parker's involvement could (quite literally) cost him everything.This is the third ""Parker Stern"" novel, and like its predecessors it is an excellent Legal Thriller/Mystery.  The storyline is well thought out and skillfully executed.  The tension never lets up, which is exactly what I want when I pick up a ""Thriller"".  The author does an excellent job of making the judicial process approachable to the reader without getting bogged down in arcane ""legalese"".  In this era of ""Court TV"" an author can't rely on ""Perry Mason"" type courtroom theatrics, and Mr. Rotstein does not do that.  What he does do is give you the sense that you're getting a behind-the-scenes view of what's involved in a high profile trial - some of it fascinating, some of it absurd, much of it surprisingly mundane.At the midpoint of the book I was feeling quite smug, pretty confident that I had figured out a key plot point.  I may have been correct, but it did not prepare me for a later revelation - I did not see that coming!  You know how sometimes you give in to the urge to flip to the last few pages to see how everything turns out?  Well, I'm glad I exerted a little self-control this time and just allowed the story to unfold - I was not disappointed!Would I recommend this book?  Absolutely, but with one caveat:  I'd strongly suggest reading the series in order.  This technically works as a standalone novel and you won't be lost if you haven't read the earlier books.  However, much of Parker's past is revealed in the first two books and knowing that history greatly added to my enjoyment of this book.The series (in order):*Corrupt Practices: A Parker Stern Novel*Reckless Disregard: A Parker Stern Novel (Parker Stern Novels)*The Bomb Maker's Son: A Parker Stern Novel","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PJIALKQYFN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880443#wasThisHelpful","R37PJIALKQYFN6","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this second series installment (following Corrupt Practices ), Parker Stern has given up on being a trial attorney and taken a job as a mediator.  Once a topnotch litigator, Parker now is paralyzed by stage fright whenever he enters a courtroom, and at barely forty years old his legal career seems to have reached a dead end.Out of the blue Parker is contacted by a video game developer who goes by the alias ""Poniard"".  Poniard has created a game that implicates a powerful media executive in the disappearance of a young actress, and is facing a civil suit for libel.  Parker is essentially blackmailed into taking the case, but is intrigued by it at the same time.  Who is Poniard?  What really happened to the troubled starlet, Felicity McGrath?  What role did billionaire William Bishop play in her disappearance?I love a good legal Mystery/Thriller, and this one checked off all the boxes.  Parker Stern is a complex and compelling protagonist, there's a multi-layered mystery fueling the plot and the storyline never loses momentum.  The author deftly handles the tricky problem of making the legal aspect seem plausible (at least from this layman's point of view), without overwhelming the reader with dry and tedious technicalities.  There's no treading water in this story, everything that happens advances the plot and kept me thoroughly engaged from start to finish.  This is author Robert Rotstein's milieu, and boy does it show!Obviously this was a ""hit"" for me, and I highly recommend it.  There's some occasional swearing/strong language; no explicit sexual content.  This is the second book in a series, and while it does work as a standalone novel I think you'll enjoy it more if you start with book one.The `Parker Stern' books (in order):*Corrupt Practices: A Parker Stern Novel*Reckless Disregard: A Parker Stern Novel (Parker Stern Novels)*The Bomb Maker's Son: A Parker Stern Novel","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UO5WXM1SKT6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616148810#wasThisHelpful","R1UO5WXM1SKT6H","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this second Odelia Grey mystery (following Too Big to Miss: An Odelia Grey Mystery  ), Odelia gets caught up in the chaos caused when a valuable collectable lunch box goes missing.  A lunch box?  Yes, a lunch box with a whopping six-figure price tag,  and there are people willing to do whatever it takes to get their hands on it...including murder.Odelia Grey is a refreshing addition to the ""cozy"" mystery genre.  Too often middle-aged single women in a cozy are portrayed as fusty, matronly homebodies who run tea shops or sell knitting supplies.  Odelia delightfully dodges that hoary old stereotype.  She's in her late forties, happily single with a job that she enjoys and does well.  She has an active social life and never lacks for male admirers.  She's stylish, attractive and unapologetically overweight.  It's easy to picture yourself enjoying a night out with Odelia, trading blind date horror stories and enjoying a good laugh while polishing off a bottle of merlot.As mysteries go this one is firmly on the ""cozy"" side of the street so expect to suspend disbelief.  There are suspects aplenty and one or two plot twists that caught me off guard.  I thought the denouement was a tad convoluted, requiring a few square pegs to be forced into round holes plot wise.  Nevertheless I still thoroughly enjoyed this story and I think the author did a great job of creating a likeable protagonist and a supporting cast that you just love to root for.  The SoCal location is used to good effect and Odelia's sense of humor injects a dose of fun into the plot.  I'm looking forward to reading book #3, Thugs and Kisses  .Very occasional swearing/strong language.  There's some mild sexual innuendo, but no explicit content.

"These shower curtain rings are sturdy and well-made.  The polished nickel finish is clean and sharp looking and the simple, classic design will complement many (most?) decors.  The safety-pin style closure makes hanging a shower curtain or changing the curtain liner a snap.  Best of all, these rings glide smoothly – no pulling or tugging on the shower curtain necessary.These are much, much nicer than plastic shower curtain rings and I’d expect them to be priced accordingly.

"In the four weeks since I’ve had this shredder I’ve been able to give it a good workout.  Earlier this year we had to sort out my mother’s house, and I got the job of going thru all her paperwork (lucky me).  I had 4 or 5 large cartons that eventually wound up in the shredder.  Here are my thoughts:*At approx. 22-1/2” high by 12” wide this is a large unit, so it’s very convenient that it’s on rollers.  When I’m not using it I can just roll it behind my desk.*I could not get this thing to jam!  Credit cards, CDs, overstuffed junk mail envelopes…it makes fast work of them all.  While I don’t recommend that anyone else do this, I stuffed more than the recommended 10 sheets of paper through the manual feed and still it didn’t jam.*After about 10-12 minutes of continuous shredding the unit does overheat and automatically shut off for 25 minutes.  If I start shredding again immediately after the 25 minutes is up, the unit tends to overheat and shutdown even sooner, sometimes with less than 10 minutes of continual manual shredding.  (Keep in mind though that I’m talking maximum amounts here, and the machine is running continuously).*Auto Feed – Here’s where things get tricky.  I find the auto feed function to be very finicky.  Even using well under the 200 sheet auto feed capacity, I usually have to open the lid and realign the papers at some point because shredding just stops.  The papers have to be pristinely flat – no fold marks (no matter how much you try to smooth them out).*The bin has a large capacity and slides right out for easy emptying.*Fairly quiet operation as far as shredders go.Bottom Line:  Easy, dependable manual shredding and this unit is more than adequate for home office use.  However, I find the auto feed function to be hit or miss, so if that’s an important feature for you I’d hesitate to recommend this unit.  At this price point I don’t think you should have to make many concessions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHOXK1LMO9N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW90WU#wasThisHelpful","RWHOXK1LMO9N7","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m a fan of the L’ANZA hair care line; I’ve been using their shampoos and conditioners for years.  This “Silk Serum” is a disappointment.  The first 5 ingredients listed on the back of the bottle are all some variation of silicone.  I know that most mass market “shine serums” use silicone as their main ingredient, but I expected better quality ingredients from a higher-end brand that’s sold in salons.This is supposed to “provide weightless shine and silky softness” when used on damp hair before blow drying or as a finishing serum on dry hair.  I do find that it adds shine (there’s certainly enough silicone in it!), but even the tiniest amount leaves my hair looking very flat and stick straight.  This is NOT a good product for fine hair, even when used very sparingly.  This will weigh the hair down, so if you’re looking for fullness and volume this is going to work against you.  If your hair is thick and/or the texture is coarse, then you might like the “flattening” effect, but I’d still recommend using only a very small amount.I was tempted to toss this out, but humid weather is right around the corner and I can probably use a little of this on the ends of my hair to control the dreaded frizzies.  Still, there’s absolutely nothing special about this serum, certainly nothing to warrant the salon product price tag.  You can pick up just about any drugstore shine serum at a quarter of the price and it’ll work just the same.First five ingredients listed on the back of the bottle:*cyclopentasiloxane*dimethicone*c. methicone*p. trimethicone*p. dimethicone","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266OPVC3D6UR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GI3TXQ#wasThisHelpful","R266OPVC3D6UR2","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to ‘fess up here:  I’m not a fan of puppets or ventriloquists.  As far as I’m concerned ventriloquists and mimes are about as entertaining as listening to elevator music.  What does any of this have to do with a Romance book you ask?  Well, the heroine in this story is a ventriloquist/puppeteer, and it’s treated like she’s got this super-awesome talent.  She just seemed dorky and annoying to me.Annie Hewitt has hit a dead-end.  At 33 she has to accept that her acting career is never going to get off the ground, she’s deeply in debt and physically ill.  She arrives on tiny Peregrine Island (off the coast of Maine) in the middle of winter during a snowstorm.  She’s hoping to find something of value in the cottage that her late mother used live in.  What she finds is no heat or electricity.  Things go downhill from there.Theo Harp was Annie’s stepbrother for about 5 minutes twenty years ago, and he’s nothing but a bad memory to Annie.  Unfortunately, he’s now her neighbor on the island.  Funny thing is, Theo is all grown up and not as creepy has he used to be…or is he?I’m not reading a lot in the Romance genre these days, but since I really enjoyed Susan Elizabeth Phillips’ “Chicago Stars” series I figured I’d give this book a shot.  Well, it’s not in the same league as those books, but it’s entertaining (if slightly odd).  Annie’s character loves classic Gothic Romance books and this story is something of homage to “Rebecca” or “Jane Eyre”, and I thought that was pretty clever.  There’s a surprising darkness to this story, with all the main characters having tragic pasts and the setting is gloomy and mostly depressing.I never warmed up to Annie.  The author goes on and on about how gawky she looks, and while I have nothing against a plain heroine, Annie just sounded goofy.  Add to that the fact that she carries her puppets EVERYWHERE SHE GOES (!!) and in her head they “talk” to her…well, it just sounded like a character that Fred Armisen  would play in “Portlandia”!  I can just picture him with a Raggedy Anne wig on his head bouncing around talking to puppets.  How am I supposed to believe that Theo, Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome, is attracted to Annie?  Good grief!But all is not lost.  Despite the dorky heroine and the unconvincing romance, the writing is good.  There’s a little suspense/mystery that kept me interested and I was eager to find out what Theo’s backstory was.

"What a clever idea for inexpensive decorating that doesn’t leave permanent damage to your walls!Hanging these tiles could not be any easier – no tools required.  The back of the base has a Velcro square that the Command strip attaches to, then you remove the liner from the strip and attach it to your wall.  The base even has a built in level that makes the process virtually foolproof.  The decorative face of the tile attaches magnetically to the base and can be swapped out for another design without having to reposition the base.Second thoughts about where you’ve hung the tile?  No problem!  Simply grab the bottom corners of the base and peel it away from the wall – it comes right off.  The Command strip can be removed by pulling down (follow the instructions included with the product) and doesn’t leave a mark or remove any paint from your wall.I really love this product.  We just painted the walls in our home office and I’m not sure what I want to permanently hang up in there.  Instead of looking at boring bare walls (or making a bunch of nail holes to hang something temporarily), I’ve hung up 3 of these black and white photograph tiles.

"Cooler temperatures are not the only thing November brings to Abbotsville - a newcomer has decided to take the town by storm.  Wealthy Connie Clayborn is a northern transplant and finds that the town is just not up to her standards, and she's not shy about doling out the criticism.I think you can imagine how well that went over with Miss Julia.Miss Julia has every intention of putting the uppity interloper in her place, but instead of delivering a well-deserved dressing down to Mrs. Clayborn, Miss Julia finds herself at the center of a criminal investigation.  Really, who has time for such a thing when she's in the middle of planning her annual Christmas ""soiree""?I'm a big fan of this series and I've faithfully read all the installments, enjoying each and every one.  That said, I was a tad underwhelmed by this storyline.  The humor in these books is usually more understated, relying on Miss J's clever musings about human nature and changing social mores.  There's less of that in this story and a lot more silliness.  I still enjoyed it - time spent in the company of these wonderful characters is never wasted! - but I felt like it was missing something.  Normally I have a few favorite quotes from each book and this time...nothing stands out.Now lest I start sounding  too cranky, there's a lot to like about this book.  The author has created an absolutely charming cast of characters and just reading the dialog alone is a joy for me.  She really captures the natural sound of a conversation and she's able to convey dialect that comes off as pitch-perfect.  This book is full of warmth and humor.  It left me feeling uplifted and optimistic, and as far as I'm concerned that's worth the price of admission.If you're new to the series then the 16th installment is not the place to start!  Do yourself a huge favor and begin at book one,Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind .  You won't be sorry.  There's no swearing/strong language or sexual content.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTSRE4BZFBK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFZ8JQ6#wasThisHelpful","RYTSRE4BZFBK2","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never expected to find a casual rain jacket that was actually flattering, but this one really is.  This Columbia hooded jacket has a fitted look and when you wear it belted it highlights your curves.  I normally wear a Women’s size 4/6, and the size Small fit me perfectly.  I can wear a lightweight sweater underneath but anything too bulky would make for a tight fit.  The attached hood has a drawstring closure so it stays in place (and keeps your hair dry) even when the wind picks up.  We’ve had a lot of rain over the past two weeks and this has kept me completely dry.Fit:  True to size, but it’s a slim look.  Consider sizing up if you plan on layering it over heavyweight clothing.  I had to cuff the sleeves, which is a little odd as my arms are fairly long.Warmth:  Not lined, so offers minimal warmth.  Not a cold weather jacket.Misc.:  Great for travel; packs well and the nylon material resists wrinkles.  Two-way zipper, removable belt, drawstring hood, snap closure, deep inside pocketsI love this jacket – it’s functional and flattering and Columbia products are good quality.  I got this for around $60 and I’m very happy – I would have paid more for it.

"As acting chief of police for the small East Texas town of Jarrett Creek, Samuel Craddock's ""official"" duties consist mainly of settling minor disputes and keeping an eye on the local high school kids on prom night.  ""Unofficially"" he begins to poke around in the past of his neighbor (and close friend) Jenny Sandstone when her ailing mother fears that Jenny is in danger.  This puts Samuel in a precarious position - does he risk losing Jenny's friendship by prying into her private life or does he respect her wishes and leave things alone, even if that means she's in some kind of danger?This is the 4th entry in the series, and while it technically works as a standalone novel I think I was at a slight disadvantage by not having read the previous books.  Clearly these characters have well-established relationships and quite a bit of history between them, and as a newcomer I wasn't privy to all that.  Despite that I did enjoy this story and plan on going back and reading the series in order (and really, most series should be read in order, don't you think?).Samuel Craddock is a seasoned (a nice way of saying ""not young"") investigator who believes in serving his community by upholding the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.  He knows his town and his people and cares deeply about both.  Calm, intelligent, intuitive and a true gentleman, Samuel is the kind of man who engenders trust and respect.  He's a very likeable protagonist and it's interesting to watch him piece together the evidence and solve the mystery.This is definitely a character-driven story.  At first glance this could almost pass for a ""cozy"" mystery, but I wouldn't pigeonhole it as one.  Jarrett Creek may have a wholesome charm to it, but it's no Texas version of Brigadoon.  The characters are complex and have real problems; there's alcoholism and spousal abuse - not typical ""cozy"" fare.  The strength of the story lies in the fine characterization and the author's knack for setting a scene so realistic that you feel like you're standing right there.  The dialog sounded authentic to my Yankee ears (so take that for what it's worth!) and while the pace is deliberately slow, I didn't find it plodding in the least.Bottom Line:  A low-key, character-driven Mystery with an engaging protagonist.  The small town, East Texas setting is charming.  I don't recall much in the way of swearing/strong language and there's no sexual content.Book One:  A Killing at Cotton Hill: A Samuel Craddock Mystery Book Two:  The Last Death of Jack Harbin: A Samuel Craddock MysteryBook Three:  Dead Broke in Jarrett Creek: A Samuel Craddock Mystery Book Four:  A Deadly Affair at Bobtail Ridge: A Samuel Craddock Mystery ","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFYUBKHSNRGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163388046X#wasThisHelpful","R3JFYUBKHSNRGP","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything is booming in the tiny town of Grimstad, North Dakota – oil, housing, jobs…and crime.  Cassie Dewell’s first day on the job as lead investigator for the sheriff’s department starts off with a bang when body parts are discovered strewn throughout the town.  Is it drug related?  Gang related?  Cassie will have to scramble to get this case solved before a huge influx of crystal meth hits the streets and the body count escalates.What struck me about this story is the way the author brought the town of Grimstad to life.  On the surface it seems like an oil boom would be a good thing.  The economy is thriving, there’s virtually no unemployment (fast food workers make $18 an hour) and people are becoming rich practically overnight.  But there’s a desperate, seedy quality to the town:  overcrowding everywhere, an explosion of drugs and all the related crime that goes with that.  On top of it winter is setting in and daytime temperatures dip well below zero.  The cold is oppressive and the author uses it to good effect.Cassie Dewell is an interesting character, not a cookie-cutter heroine.  She’s 36, plump, a widow and a mother.  She’s a talented investigator but it’s clear that she’ll bend the rules to get the outcome she wants.  I would have liked her to play a larger role in the story, but she competes for page time with several other characters.This is my first C. J. Box book and I can see why he’s so popular.  The writing is very solid, with good characterization and authentic sounding dialog.  I thought he did a great job of maintaining a sense of tension throughout the storyline and I could never find a good place to leave off whenever I had to interrupt my reading – “just let me read this next part…” became my mantra.My one gripe about this book is that I had issues with an element that comes into play at the very end.  I won’t “spoil” anything, I’ll just say that there was something that lacked credibility for me and required more suspension of disbelief than I would have liked.  Overall though I did enjoy this and would recommend it.Occasional strong language, some violence, no sexual content.  While this works as a standalone novel, the character of “Cassie” clearly made her debut in an earlier book because part of that storyline made its way into this story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM7HT7FIMO3H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312583214#wasThisHelpful","RM7HT7FIMO3H0","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Odelia Grey learns that her friend Sophie has committed suicide, she's completely shocked.  Sophie was outgoing, vivacious and successful - why would she take her own life?  As Odelia begins the process of getting Sophie's affairs in order, she finds out that her friend harbored more than a few very big secrets - did one of those secrets lead to her death?  Odelia feels that she owes it to Sophie to find out, and she manages to stir up a whole lot of trouble in the process.I liked this story, but mostly I just really liked Odelia.  How often does a middle-aged woman who is considerably overweight get to be the star of the show?  Odelia pulls it off nicely.  Attractive and happily single, Odelia has a good job and a nice life in Southern California.  She's smart and self-confident and there's not a lot of weight-related angst in this book.  She's big, she knows it and what's more - she OWNS it.  Great character.The mystery is pretty good, with lots of secrets and layers to keep you on your toes.  It doesn't stray too far from the ""cozy"" side of the street, so don't expect CSI-like reality - suspension of disbelief is definitely required!  Still, the author gave Odelia some smarts and she's not just bumbling her way through the story, she's putting the pieces together in a way that makes sense.It's unusual for a ""cozy"" to have any sexual content, but this story does.  There's nothing explicit - no, not at all - but there's at least one scene with Odelia and her romantic interest that's not the usual fade-to-black.  Also, online pornography plays a role in the story.  I'm not doing any pearl-clutching here, just a `heads-up' to ""cozy"" readers who might not expect any sizzle in their storyline.I do have one tiny little bone to pick with the author.  While I'm aware that there's plenty of ""fat shaming"" that goes on in our appearance-obsessed culture, it was a little over-the-top in this story.  I hope that gets toned down as the series progresses.To me, a good ""cozy"" is all about the characters, and the author nailed it in that department.  The setting (So Cal) is nicely described and I think the author has laid the foundation for an interesting series.  I've already purchased the second book,The Curse of the Holy Pail: An Odelia Grey Mystery (The Odelia Grey Mysteries Book 2),  and look forward to reading it.*There are a few kindle formatting issues - nothing too distracting, but there were places where the dialog got confusing because there were no paragraph breaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39PHJE6GZN232/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQ8GA10#wasThisHelpful","R39PHJE6GZN232","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you’ve ever felt like there wasn’t an inch to spare when you were stretched out on your yoga mat then this might be what you’re looking for.  At 10 inches longer and 2 inches wider than a standard sized mat, this will accommodate taller folks quite nicely.The black side of the mat has a textured feel and the blue side is smooth.  It’s slightly thicker than my old Gaiam mat, and offers a bit more cushion, but it’s a yoga mat not an air mattress – don’t expect total comfort (especially on a hard surface).  I find it reasonably comfortable for yoga/floor exercises, but I’m a fairly small person.  If you’re dealing with sore joints or back issues then you might want to look for something that offers more padding.  I don’t have any problems with the mat being slippery when I sweat, but I always have a towel close by.  The extra size makes the mat a little more awkward to tote around with you, but it’s certainly doable.  I’ve had good luck with Gaiam mats (I have two that have lasted for years and years), so I feel comfortable recommending this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26B87S2XAGVJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2PBPFY#wasThisHelpful","R26B87S2XAGVJM","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to confess that I'm a hair product junkie and love to experiment with new products.  My ""experiments"" are not always successful, but this conditioning mask really worked for me.  My hair is long and color treated; I shampoo and blow dry daily and use a curling iron or flat iron more than I probably should.  Despite the abuse I heap on my hair it's in good shape, though it's on the dry side (no surprise!) and this product leaves my hair soft and smooth with plenty of bounce and shine.How to use:  Shampoo hair and wring out the excess water.  Apply a small amount (I use a Tablespoon but you may need more or less depending on length and texture) and leave on for a few minutes.  Rinse thoroughly and style as usual.  For more intense conditioning I apply the mask and cover my head with an inexpensive plastic shower cap then wrap a warm towel over that, and leave it in my hair for 15 minutes before rinsing.Tips:  1.69 oz. is not a lot of product but you can use it sparingly.  Most people don't need a lot of conditioning at the root area, so you can apply from the mid-shaft to the ends.  In fact, if your hair texture is fine and you're worried about the conditioner weighing it down and making it look flat, I'd recommend skipping the root area.  This is a weekly treatment and not meant for use as a daily conditioner.Bottom Line:  Leaves my hair soft and shiny with lots of volume.  I'm not mad about the vanilla scent, but I don't find it unpleasant or overpowering either.  May not be rich enough for coarse or very damaged hair types. **Not Recommended for those who prefer fragrance free products**","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZJXWCS7VG5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYZY6UW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZJXWCS7VG5I","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With two large hairy dogs in residence I vacuum frequently.  My house has hardwood floors throughout with tile in the baths, and while there is no carpeting I do have several large (low pile) area rugs.  Any vacuum that comes into this house had better be ready for a workout!  I’m happy to report that this Miele canister vac is up to the task.This vacuum is easy to assemble.  I had it out of the box and up and running in under 10 minutes.  At approx. 14lbs this is a surprisingly lightweight vacuum and is easy to maneuver.  The low profile canister is solid and not prone to tipping over.  The extra-long cord allows you to vacuum a large area without having to switch outlets, which is a real plus.  The cord retracts automatically with a push of a button.  Using the most powerful setting this vacuum does a great job of picking up dog hair.The standout feature for me is the parquet twister attachment for non-carpeted flooring.  This glides easily over hardwood and tile; has a 180 degree rotation that allows you to vacuum right up against your baseboards as well as in tight spaces (under and behind furniture).Other notable features:*Six power settings*extendable stainless steel wand (great for overhead cleaning)*cleaning attachments for upholstery, drapes, etc.*relatively quiet operation*Airflow indicator on the front of the canister indicates when it’s time to change the filter bagA couple of concerns…*I was underwhelmed by the suction when vacuuming the area rugs.  Even at the highest setting I had to go over the same area repeatedly in order to pick up pet hair.  I’ve owned vacuums that were far less expensive than this one that did a better job on low pile carpet/rugs.*Miele replacement filter bags are not inexpensive, and with the amount of dog hair I pick up I’ll be changing the bags fairly frequently.Bottom Line:  This is a very nice, high quality vacuum.  I would highly recommend it if your living space is mainly uncarpeted.  I don’t think this is the best option (especially at this price point!) if you have dense or high-pile carpeting.  The cost of replacing filter bags is a consideration, though if you’re not dealing with a lot of pet hair you probably won’t be replacing the bags as often as I need to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ55I4VA3GQDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGW2#wasThisHelpful","RQ55I4VA3GQDI","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story takes place in Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, after the double whammy of Katrina and the BP oil spill have crippled the shrimping industry.  We’re introduced to a cast of characters, each just trying to get by now that their entire way of life is threatened.  Some are determined to continue shrimping, even though they can barely eke out a living; some have moved on to more lucrative (and less legal) ways to turn a buck; some get by on booze, pills and pipe dreams about pirate treasure.  Their individual stories intertwine, and by the end of the book these characters will have collided with each other resulting in some interesting consequences.The characters don’t just carry the storyline, they ARE the storyline.  The author managed to depict this can of mixed nuts so vividly that I felt like I had actually met these people.  Their appearance, their accents, their mannerisms…these characters took on a life of their own, and with a mixture of revulsion and fascination I just couldn’t look away.This is not a novel that fits comfortably in any one genre.  I wouldn’t classify it as a Mystery; perhaps Southern Noir is a more apt description.  At any rate, it’s an often dark story that manages to avoid being overwhelmingly depressing because the author lets some humor seep into the mix.  Interestingly, while some of the humor does come at the characters’ expense, I also could sense the author’s compassion for these people, which made them seem all the more human to me.Would I recommend this book?  I can tell you that I definitely enjoyed it; the writing is very good and the characterization is outstanding.  If you’re a very plot-driven reader then the lack of a central Mystery might leave you feeling that the story lacks focus, but if you enjoy rich characterization then you might want to give this a try.Occasional swearing/strong language.

"If just the thought of assembling a piece of furniture makes you want to scream in terror, let me put your mind at ease – the only thing you need to do with this futon is screw on the legs.  It takes 10-15 minutes (tops!) and everything you need is included, even the little “L” shaped thingy (that’s the professional name) that you use to tighten the bolts.This futon arrives in a big bulky box.  The product page lists the shipping weight as 90+ pounds (you may want someone to give you a hand hauling this into the house).  All you do is unfold the futon, screw on the legs and – voila! – Instant couch!I think this futon is quite comfortable to sit on, but the cushions are very firm – this is not soft, plush seating.  It’s a solid, sturdy piece and put together well.  At 6’2” and 200 pounds my husband is not a “dainty” guy, and he can flop down onto this without causing the futon to wobble or move.  The weight limit is listed as 600 pounds – or my husband times three (and there’s a thought I don’t wish to explore any further).  You can call it “faux-leather” if you like, but it’s vinyl and it looks like it, but it’s stitched and finished very nicely and is a handsome looking piece.The seat backs fold down easily to create a (smallish) bed.  My measurements disagree slightly with those on the product page.  I measured this as 68” x 43” when it is folded out.  If you plan on using this as a spare bed, I’d highly recommend getting an inexpensive mattress topper; it’ll go a long way towards making your guest more comfortable.  Tall folks won’t be stretching out on this – my husband’s calves were hanging off the end!The one negative thing I have to say about this futon is that it had a very strong plastic/chemical odor when I took it out of the box.  After airing it out for 48 hours the smell is barely noticeable, but this could be a problem for those who are sensitive to such things.Bottom Line:  Budget friendly, low profile, comfortable seating.

"My expectations for any anti-aging product are pretty modest.  I think that certain products can make your skin tone appear more even resulting in a brighter complexion, and skin that reflects light prettily tends to appear more youthful.  I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  That being said...SK-II is a well-known, high-end skin care line and I was excited to give it a try.  This product arrived without any instructions, which I find odd.  Does it replace your toner or do you use it after your toner?  I had to go online to the company's website to do a little research.  You apply this product to clean skin.  You can use a cotton pad or pat it into the skin with your hands.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there's no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  I experience no stinging, redness, irritation or breakouts.  This does leave my skin feeling a little tight, and I follow up with my usual daytime moisturizer and nighttime retinol cream.After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily) I have to say that I've noticed absolutely no change in my skin whatsoever.  Now I'm pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it's entirely possible that what I'm using is effective and I'm not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.Bottom line:  Pleasant and easy to use; no unwanted side effects but also no noticeable improvement.Would I recommend this product?  Hard to say.  Everyone's skin is different and I've read online testimonials by women who swear by this stuff.  Since it didn't do anything for me, I can't be too enthusiastic about it, and frankly I find the price a bit prohibitive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AHPE89797BOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H723LU#wasThisHelpful","R1AHPE89797BOR","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve reached the point where the mountain of books in my to-be-read pile will surely outlive me, so I seldom re-read a novel.  This book is a rare exception.  I loved this one when I first read it back in 2000, and I loved it every bit as much when I re-read it earlier this month.Elfrida Phipps made her living as a stage actress.  Not a famous actress or even (perhaps) a particularly talented one, but it paid the rent.  Now that she’s reached retirement age she’s decided to move away from London and buys herself a tiny cottage in a small country village.  End of story, right?  Hardly; it’s just the beginning of Elfrida’s ‘second act’.The bulk of the story takes place just before Christmas, in the north of Scotland where Elfrida is ensconced in a stately old manor house.  She’s joined there by a mix of family and almost-strangers, none of them looking forward to the holidays.  But a funny thing happens – this holiday that they’d all been dreading (each for different reasons), ends up becoming a celebration of healing and starting over.“Winter Solstice” is not, in my opinion, Rosamunde Pilcher’s best novel.  The dialog often has a very scripted feel to it, especially when it involves the teen-age characters.  Now normally awkward dialog is the kiss of death for any book I happen to be holding in my picky little hands, but not so with this one.  The central themes of this story – healing, starting over, second chances – are so powerful and appealing that I can’t help but adore the book.  The author draws you into the story with such succinct and vivid descriptions of the places and the people; everything comes to life on the page.  The emotions that these characters are experiencing are bound to resonate with almost everyone, and the overall hopeful feeling that pervades the story makes it a wonderful book to pick up if you’re in the mood for something uplifting and life-affirming.

Feeling like she needs to do something drastic to propel herself out of her self-imposed social exile, she plans to travel to Italy at the end of the school year; she’s not sure when (or even if) she’ll be returning to Hope Springs.Callum Drake is a single parent and his daughter is in Brooklyn’s class.  A former “bad boy” biker, Callum now makes his living creating artisan chocolates.  Callum is all about setting down roots in Hope Springs and giving his daughter a stable childhood.When Brooklyn and Callum meet it’s lust-at-first-sight, but the timing couldn’t be worse.  Brooklyn will have to decide if she’s really and truly ready to “move on”.Callum’s character had a lot of potential.  He’s not a sanitized Romance version of a “bad boy biker”; he’s done some bad things and made some really lousy choices.  But he’s turned his life around and he just adores his daughter.  The best part of the story was seeing them interact; their relationship is just sweet and wonderful.  I wish the story had focused more on Callum.I didn’t’ feel like there was a whole lot of chemistry between Callum and Brooklyn.  From the moment Brooklyn meets Callum she obsessively lusts after him, but it felt like she was just tired of living like a nun more than anything else.  And truthfully I don’t know why Callum was so besotted by Brooklyn, since she is the Queen of mixed signals and half the yummy mummys in town are lusting after him.  85% of the story consists of Brooklyn making up lame excuses to run into Callum and then telling him (repeatedly) that she doesn’t date the parents of her students.  Given the circumstances it’s probably understandable that she couldn’t seem to make up her mind about anything, but I found it tiresome to read about.The writing is solid and there are some sweet moments (mostly between Callum and his daughter), but for a story about a young widow it sure didn’t pack much of an emotional wallop.  Three stars.This book is part of the Hope Springs series, but it easily works as a standalone story.  There are few characters besides Callum and Brooklyn and none of them are really central to the storyline.  There’s occasional swearing/strong language and some brief sexual content (not particularly explicit).*I borrowed this from the Kindle Owners Lending Library","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D6IUHMEJ7UZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PR32G2K#wasThisHelpful","R3D6IUHMEJ7UZL","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Through deeply personal anecdotes and essays author Barbara Mahany shares her belief that God can be found in the ordinary moments that make up our everyday lives.  Divided into Seasons, this book is a collection of her thoughts and observations about learning to slow down, pay attention and really be aware of what's going on in the moment.While the author is a Christian, this book is more spiritual in nature than it is overtly religious.  Hers is a multi-faith family, and she embraces her husband's Jewish faith and traditions, as well as incorporating elements of the natural world into her belief system.My Thoughts:  I could definitely identify with much of what the author had to say.  We are probably close in age; I'm also a wife and a mother and much of what she writes about is familiar to me.  I'm not a religious person, but I share her belief that the key to happiness and contentment is to find meaning (and joy) in all the ""little things"" that make up our lives.  If you're looking for practical advice on how you can find more meaning in your everyday life, you may not find it here.  This isn't presented as a ""How To"" type of book, it's the author's experience.This book reminded me in many ways of Sarah Ban Breathnac's ""Simple Abundance"".  There are similar themes:  finding the ""Sacred in the Ordinary""; ""cultivating gratitude""; ""living by your own lights"".  The new-age catchphrases may not appeal to everyone, and at times the writing was a bit too flowery for my taste.  However, I also found some of the passages to be really lovely - sincere and thought-provoking.Since I knew I'd be reviewing this book, I read it ""cover-to-cover"", and I don't believe that that's the best way to experience it.  The book is broken down into seasons, and that's how I'd recommend reading it.  Start with whatever season you're in and read a passage or two every day.  Take a cue from the title - ""Slowing Time"" - maybe the key to finding the Sacred in the Ordinary is slowing down long enough to recognize it when you see it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRZEVICGN4F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142677642X#wasThisHelpful","R1HRZEVICGN4F2","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been looking for a pillow to match a cable knit throw that I’ve had for a while now, but every time I find one that looks like a good match the price is outrageous.  This is a pillow cover rather than a pillow (you need to provide your own insert), but it matches perfectly and it didn’t break the bank.The quality of this pillow cover is excellent.  The knit is tight and there are no gaps or pulls in the material.  The seams are finished beautifully and the zipper is truly hidden – you won’t have to position the pillow to cover the zipper side because you don’t even notice it.  The material is soft (I believe it’s cotton) and can be machine washed (though I’d recommend the gentle or hand wash cycle).  I wouldn’t throw this in the dryer.  I got this for around $20 and, considering the quality, I think it was a bargain.*Made in China","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OG3HKQ68ACC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRTBY8E#wasThisHelpful","R5OG3HKQ68ACC","A1XCSAX4BRT89Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCSAX4BRT89Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ISBN 0847812111,  Brunelleschi's early architectural, interior, and structural projects are depicted in excellent illustrations: 6 in color and approx. 200 in black-and-white including many photos as well as plans, sections, elevations, axonometric views, hand sketches of high quality, and models. The ample textual analysis is excellent. It is well published on 175 pages inlc. splendid graphic design, printing on glossy paper, and hardcover binding.FROM FRONT FLAP:Professor Heinrich Klotz, highly influential critic of art and architecture offers, in this book, a unique and fresh way of looking at the beginnings of Renaissance architecture. Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446), born in Florence, recognised as the first Renaissance architect, learnt the canons of Classical architecture in Rome. His debt to the Classical tradition and the development of the Renaissance style are not disputed. This book examines his early works, not in their Roman setting, but in the light of Gothic architecture, revealing that the architecture of the ‘Proto-Renaissance’ was not just a Classical revival, but depended on the continuing influence of the architecture of the late Trecento. Brunelleschi’s style is examined in detail, and for the first time the elements of the medieval tradition on which he drew are precisely identified. His position in stylistic terms, precisely on the dividing line between the end of the Middle Ages and the dawning of the Modern Age, makes him the first architect of the Modern era. This book, exploring the historical links between these two ages, makes a vital contribution to the study of the great master of the early Renaissance.CONTENTS: FOREWORD 7PART I BRUNELLESCHI'S STYLE 9I THE COLUMN  11 1.

"****½ Silk Vault Slim Wallet for iPhone 5/5s is tub-style, 15 mm (0.6 in) thick, and made of the somewhat soft and shock absorbing rubber with a mat surface, which may show scratches.  The case's walls wrap around the phone's edges and protrude above the display to amortize falls without covering it. The embankments are not very high and do not make too difficult the thumb typing next to the phone's edges, as bad cases do.  A thin layer of soft-touch rubber would be insufficient to protect the phone's back, but here comes the cleverly added-on pocket integrated with the back and protecting it.At 1.1 oz (30 g), the case is lightweight, rounded, fits well in the palm of hand, not slippery, does not cover anything requiring direct access including controls and dock connector allowing charging while in case, and does have very functional protrusions covering the buttons and allowing to feel and press them as without the cover. The bottom's surface is mat and may little attract grime, though it can be easily washed.The glass screen is not easy to scuff or scratch, but protecting it preserves the pristine condition & the resale value. The enclosed screen protector is durable, masks fingerprints, diffuses ambient light, reduces glare, but also clarity, especially of the crispiest screens, due to the finish and the increasing accumulation of the invisible fingerprints, and causes the rainbow effect that might be annoying. It is easy to remove without a residue left.First, read the instruction and clean the surface. Tape the protector's edge (the clear backing down) to the surface edge with an alignment strip or a substitute. Flip the protector over the attached edge, lift the protector's backing starting from that edge, and roll the exposed sticky protector's back over the surface slowly covering it with the aid of the edge of the cardboard packaging or a short ruler. Applying light pressure initially allows easy peeling back for corrections, as the adhesive is sensitive to pressure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U0GD7O2OLXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRPJIYY#wasThisHelpful","R3U0GD7O2OLXB","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CM4 Q Card Case for iPhone 5/5s is tub-style, 13 mm (0.5 in) thick, and made of the somewhat soft and shock absorbing rubber with a nice mat surface.

"****½ Extreme Max 3006.7228 BoatTector 24"" Contour Fender Value Pack is well made, practical, durable, and aesthetic.  The black fender lines constitute good looking accents over the white marine-grade tri-laminate cover with double thermal-bonded seams and corrosion-proof polycarbonate grommets.  White in marine applications works like black on land unless the boat sails in very dirty waters.  It is more practical than black, as it will very, very slowly and gradually aged by getting darker and maybe minimally yellowish while retaining its clean and natural look with distinction.  Black - on the other hand - shows caught grime as a yellow-brown  residue looking dirty.  The 3006.7228 effectively protects 1000-lb boat against a bump-caused damage at the speed of at least 1 mph.  The flat construction prevents it from moving up caused by heaving, unless its amplitude is greater than the fenders vertical height.  Then, traditional, heavy,  rope-made fenders are better.  The black ropes are modern: strong, durable, lightweight, and flexible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12L3W53LFLZ4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4HFNXK#wasThisHelpful","R12L3W53LFLZ4R","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**** CM4 Q Card Case for Galaxy S6 is tub-style, 12 mm (0.5 in) thick, and made of the somewhat soft and shock absorbing rubber with a nice mat surface.  The case's walls wrap around the phone's edges and protrude above the display to amortize falls without covering it. The embankments are not high and do not make difficult the thumb typing next to the phone's edges, as cheap cases do.  A thin layer of soft-touch rubber would be insufficient to protect the phone's back, but here comes the add-on pocket cleverly surrounded by the raised embankment providing the back's protection and also housing the slot for the credit card sticking out and constituting the useful kickstand. Marvelous ingenuity.At 1.3 oz (38 g), the case is lightweight, rounded, fits well in the palm of hand, not slippery, does not cover anything requiring direct access including controls and dock connector allowing charging while in case, and does have very functional protrusions covering the buttons and allowing to feel and press them as without the cover. The bottom's surface is partially covered by textured leatherette of the pocket and does not attract grime, though it can be easily washed in the unlikely event.  The positions achieved with the kickstand are useful especially for watching videos.The glass screen is not easy to scuff or scratch, but protecting it preserves the pristine condition & the resale value. The enclosed screen protector is durable, masks fingerprints, diffuses ambient light, reduces glare, but also clarity, especially of the crispiest screens, due to the finish and the increasing accumulation of the invisible fingerprints, and causes the rainbow effect that might be annoying. It is easy to remove without a residue left.First, read the instruction and clean the surface.

"****½ K'NEX 47556 K-Force Double Draw + Target provides a lot of fun beginning with assembling 365 parts into 2 blasters (red and blue) for 2 players active at the time, where some components can be customized into various looks and functionality, according to the step-by-step instruction from the included Construction Book with clear photos, on excellent graphic level, and understandable for older children.  Also the target stand needs assembly, as per the Book, that has options and can be fun.  The same 365 parts can be used to build 1 super blaster for 1 player at a time in 2 variants with a single or double barrel, as per additional instruction available on the manufacturer's Web page in *.pdf files, one of which is over 40 MB and really requires compression to be posted.The set and its type are for visually oriented and methodical children, and not those who could not assemble a simple bookcase from IKEA.  Thus, not for everyone.  The assembly does not require much imagination, because of the detailed pictorial instruction to be rigorously followed, but has the educational value in teaching reading the instruction and translating it into the assembly process maybe accompanied by cooperation between children incl. younger ones playing together with the older, but using guns - not so much.  Nevertheless, target shooting is a great sport and practicing it develops the skills of concentration, focusing, body control, and steady hand.  The blasters and target are well designed, except maybe the load chamber ring somewhat hard to pull entirely, and made from durable plastic easy to clean, but the foam darts are not durable.

"SmartScoop Automatic Automatic Litter Box is well designed and built of robust parts.  It is easy to assemble and disassemble for periodical cleaning.  After each use, it automatically scoops the waste, lifts the lid, deposits the waste in the bag, and releases the lid, which closes.  So, the closest contact with the waste has the litter, the scooping rake, the bag, and... the lid.  However, the lid is not removable for separate washing.  It can be washed only together with the waste unit after the disassembly.  Soft waste may stick to the rake.  Despite those 2 'minors', the box is very functional and practical.The manufacturer's website features many short instructional videos. The '""How-To"" Videos' are titled (where 'SmartScoop' is abbreviated to 'SS'): Watch SS in Action!, Setting up SS, Disassembly of SS, No-Touch Waste Bags, Activated Carbon Filters, Changing the Litter, Acclimating your Cat.

Since then, she has challenged the present tendency to analyse in a formalist way. Taki Koji's essay. presents a new and convincing angle suggesting that Hasegawa's oeuvre should be viewed in social terms. Her projects, Koji claims, have the appearance of an aspect of society made comprehensible in the form of architecture'.Hasegawa's work should not be viewed simply as stimulating design; her optimism is evident in her recognition of the potential for society's transformation. Through her dialogue-based programme, an empathetic approach to architecture is made possible.Among the projects featured here is the Shiranui Psychiatric Hospital and Stress Care Centre in Ohmuta, where Hasegawa and the client spent three years discussing the relationship between architecture and medical care to en sure a holistic architectural response. Experimental therapeutic space was achieved through the use of light reflected from the sea which also provided the comfort of the natural rhythm of the tides. Similarly, for the Shonandai Cultural Centre, Hasegawa involved the local residents, allowing for close communication between the design team and the community. Through Hasegawa's reciprocal method of planning, a new, flexible architecture can be provided that accepts a diversity of individuals.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R77HEZY01SJ3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3764356057#wasThisHelpful","R77HEZY01SJ3Y","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The cat's packaging cost (prices tend to change):3 or 6 x 0.017 fl oz (0.50 ml) at $29 or $36-$50 = $569/fl oz ($19.33/ml) or $353-$490/fl oz ($12-$16.7/ml).For comparison, the dog's version costs from:1-22 lbs: 3 or 6 x 0.023 fl oz (0.67 ml) at $14.44 or $16.09 = $209/fl oz ($7.18/ml) or $117/fl oz ($4.0/ml)to as little as:89-132 lbs: 3 or 6 x 0.136 fl oz (4.02 ml) at $15.31 or $15.02 = $38/fl oz ($1.27/ml) or $25/fl oz ($0.83/ml).Thus, the cat's version is up to over 23 times (23289 %) more expensive than the cheapest version of 6 applicators for dogs 89-132 lbs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYSAMYSIQI7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CNXU#wasThisHelpful","RJYSAMYSIQI7W","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All Sentry Fiproguard Plus for Dogs contain the same ingredients for all dog weights and as those by FRONTLINE, but are much cheaper.  Their quantity doubles from one dog weight category to the next, but the prices fluctuate around ~$13, ~$29, and ~$50 without any relation to the quantities (you need to click on all), and they change often.  So, the max. price per 1 fl oz (1 ml) unit is up to 10 fold of the min.  You may find that the price for 3 applicators is the lowest for the heaviest dogs 89-132 lbs, where the quantity is the greatest (0.408 fl oz or 12.06 ml), and the for the lightest dogs 4-22 lbs, where the quantity is the smallest (0.069 fl oz or 2.01 ml).  The prices for 6 applicators may be the same for all dog weights exempt the heaviest.  But you may find that the price for 2 packages of 3 applicators is lower than the price for 6 applicators in the same dog weight category.  Obviously, the most economical are the lowest-priced applicators for heaviest dog categories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB12R0IZJF1O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CN8A#wasThisHelpful","RB12R0IZJF1O6","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***½ Antec X-1 Cooler is lacking in the design.  The cooler could be wider to cover the entire Xbox One's width, instead of only almost its half, to allow not only to stack things on the top, but first of all to install a bigger fan rotating slower and thus being not noisy, if also its blades' shape was improved to resemble those in the submarine propellers. Such silent computer fans are widely available on the market.  The location of the temperature display and the blue light indicator horizontally on the top of the cooler is unfortunate for those who like to keep their Xbox high on the shelf, because they face up, instead of being located on the front vertical surface to face forward. Also, the exhaust could face left, instead of back, and thus the farthest from the Xbox intake in order to reduce sucking in the hot exhaust air by the intake especially important in closed cabinets.

"Quite strong ullu SnapOn Grain Leather is lightweight, rounded and without edges, somewhat hard, but still flexible, too thin and compact for good protection (below 1/16 inch), fitting perfectly, not slippery, and has the elegant textured leather surface that will mask marks of use OK, when darker, and not so well, when brighter. The surface is bumpy and may attract grime, though it can be cleaned. The case does not cover anything requiring direct access including controls and dock connector allowing charging without removal, but without very functional protrusions covering the buttons and allowing to feel and press them as without the cover.  It is very simple, if not simplistic, and significantly more expensive than the excellent cases by Spigen (incl. spectacular Spigen Slim Armor in dark grey), and than Speck MightyShell, but worth consideration when the leather incl. its color is a priority.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NS0VOF2U6QKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUWLYR8#wasThisHelpful","R3NS0VOF2U6QKR","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Montana Decoy ""Kojo"" Coyote is very realistically painted on a cleverly folding flexible material.  It is easy to unfold and works well in scaring animals for a while until the clever ones notice that the position of the decoy has not changed for a day or two, gain the courage to explore the decoy, and discover that it is not an alive coyote.  Thus, it is necessary to move the decoy every day or two to a different spot to effectively drive animals away. But such a limitation characterizes all the static decoys and does not render this one inferior from to the others.  Quite to the contrary.  This one seems to be superior. It is well made, durable, lightweight, and easy to store.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F2CPSIABO3Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QVUEPI#wasThisHelpful","R2F2CPSIABO3Z9","A3FOSLM5G1BO63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FOSLM5G1BO63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***½ Stanley interlocking mats are made of high density polyurethane foam, which is much lighter, softer, and better shock absorbing, but also much less durable, than the rubber traditionally used for anti-fatigue utility mats.  The edges are tapered from the 5/8 inch average thickness to just 1/8 inch at the end. The interlocking zipper ends only 1/8"" thick seems prone to tearing at the tapered edges.Since quite a long time ago, the shock absorbing property of the floor mats has been added to work boots (sneakers and even sandals useful where hot) by improving their insoles made also of high density polyurethane foam and - if insufficient - also available separately as add-on made of even better gel, e.g. by Dr. Scholl's.

"I really have mixed emotions about this particular presentation. I, as usual, was overjoyed with Helen Hayes' performance but the appearance of Bette Davis in her waning years was almost too much to deal with. In this presentation, Miss Davis was, as usual doing her best, but was obviously having great difficulty in everything she did due to her having to deal with her VERY advanced physical problems of old age. I left me feeling a great sadness!However, the story line and presentation as a whole was marvelous and the cast was truly outstanding.

Also, DON'T let it set-up in the end of the application spout!

"I have worn sandals almost all of my life and have been sold on Columbia sandals for the past 2 decades. After almost wearing out my last pair, I ordered these to try out. They certainly have not disappointed me, probably because they are of the same design that I am used to. The main difference is that I have grown used to a more firm and maintainable sole pad of molded, fairly firm, synthetic rubber and these have a somewhat padded suede pad of leather-like material. I have grown to appreciate these probably due to the softer foot pad that is extremely comfortable.

"My only complaint could easily be solved with just a LITTLE thought by the makers: The electrical cord plug comes all the way out of the end of the handle which leads to real wear problems on the cord's insulated covering for those who would (like me) like to store their saw by standing it on end, possibly in the corner. I'm solving the problem to the best of my ability by wrapping that part of the cord with electrical tape but this won't last long if I use the saw often, which I'll probably do.Other than that, I like the saw and will probably use it often because it performs it's job very well when put to use.I only wish that I had gone a little further in my research when I ordered it and discovered a later model (Sun Joe SWJ802E-RM) that allows changing the cutting angle of the saw blade (at practically the same price). This small and simple change in design greatly increases the use of this device!Also: If you go to the manufacturer's web site to register this saw, there is a very frustrating flaw in the registration process. In entering the serial number of the saw in the online form, you will probably be told that you need to enter more digits than the saw came with on it's paperwork and labels. I was told by phone by one of their representatives to simply add zeros to the front of the serial number until the number is accepted.

"After taking this for only 3 days, I am already feeling and recognizing the good things this can do for my overall health and well being. I was beginning to suffer from constant diarrhea, a roughening and blotchy skin tone, sleeplessness, and overall listlessness. Life was getting to be a real chore and more dreary every day. For the last 3 days, I have taken one of these every morning and another every evening and am beginning to feel like a real human being again. The diarrhea is gone, I am sleeping better and feeling better all over.Starting tomorrow, I will cut my usage down to only one of these every morning and see if any thing changes.I have been doing research on probiotics and have learned some very important things that I believe should be taught at every grade schooler: First is that antibiotics, which are frequently given to people with infections, normally will kill many of the healthy proboitics that we were born with and may times, these just don't come back well. I have also learned that all probiotic pills don't have the same probiotics that we need and the differences can cause the restorations that we need to be sporadic and lesser or more effective for different people. If I don't get a really positive continuation of the effectiveness that I feel I should be getting from this particular brand, I will next experiment with taking another brand along with this one to see if there is any improvement.Will try to keep this review updated with my results.Also: I strongly recommend that everyone who has a good search engine in their web browser, do a search on the word, ""probiotics"" and do a little research.

"I have a really nice set of car top luggage carriers that had mounting clamps that could scratch the paint on the car when they were clamped on. I tried painting the clamps with silicon glue to protect the car from scratching but the paint proved to be unreliable due to it's ease of rubbing/peeling off under stress. I purchased this tape in hopes that it could do a better job of hanging onto the clamps and stop the problem of paint scratching. This turned out to be the cat's meow in doing what I wanted it to do. The tape has proven to be durable to the frictional wear of the clamps and the car's paint is out of danger.

"For all the bad reviews of this product, it is absolutely obvious that the biggest problem with it is that those who hate it don't know how to order the right product for their vehicle or don't have the thoughtfulness or initiative to properly assemble it and make it work. I have one of these for my 2006 Toyota Camry and it works perfectly and hangs on tightly and well without ever scratching the paint. Yes, it would not have worked so well if I had mounted it with no thought or modifications but I simply added a bit of Tressostar bicycle handlebar tape to the hook of the mounting clamps to keep them from scratching the car's paint and then bent the clamps, by hand, to properly grab the roof at the right angle which was super easy to do.The racks are now very easy to mount quickly and solidly and they never give me the least amount of trouble.I WILL agree that it would have been more thoughtful and advantageous if the manufacturer had included assembly instructions and would have added to the acceptance of their product, but I had no real problem in figuring it out with a little thoughtfulness.Makes one wonder why so many people don't realize why we were born with brains.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CY8T39PI9T9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EZOIMU#wasThisHelpful","R2CY8T39PI9T9K","ADWUJZ8865J2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWUJZ8865J2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update - 9/3/15:Much to my dismay, this stuff has seriously let me down. I have learned after several uses of the car-top clamps I put this on that it easily peels off of the clamps under stress. IT WILL NOT HANG ON TO THE SIMPLE METAL CLAMPS. I have replaced it on the clamps with simple strips of Tressostar bicycle handlebar tape and the problem is solved; the tape hangs on doggedly and does it's job remarkably well.Update 9/12/15:More negatives experienced: Installed some rubber pads on plastic framing with this over 2 weeks ago and discovered that this stuff was still mostly in the liquid state and not holding on. The way that I discovered this is that I put a little pressure on one of the pads and it simply fell loose. Only the bare edges were even attempting to harden on just a few of the installations. Then, getting the old soft and gooey GE5030 removed to reuse the rubber pads and plastic framing was an extremely difficult chore in which I had to remove it with a very strong paint remover and paint brush cleaner in order to reuse the pads and framing.Don't buy this stuff!!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMZ4HT8YPMGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RMROGY#wasThisHelpful","R3BMZ4HT8YPMGG","ADWUJZ8865J2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWUJZ8865J2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some serious logistical problems here! Package arrived in a cardboard box that was very poorly sealed and one end was split wide open for almost 2 feet. The long metal crossbars were covered with rust. Bags holding smaller hardware were split open and contents were running around loose in the box, It's a wonder that none of these fell out of the split in the box. The so-called 8X11"" instruction sheet was crumpled and torn and poked with holes so badly that it was almost totally useless.The long metal top bars had jagged metal ridges on the ends that required a lot of filing to remove them and make the bars safe to handle. The clamping plates that gripped the top edges of the car also had these jagged metal edges that required a lot of filing to assure the safety of the car's paint where they attached. Even after getting rid of these jagged edges, I had to coat the clamping parts of these plates with Tressostar's bicycle handlebar tape to further protect the car's paint at the mount clampinging points. Also had to trim the very rough edges of the rubber mounting foot pads and glue them to the plastic uprights to get them to stay on.Helpful hint: To complete assembly of these 2 racks, after installation of the end tabs that grab the roof, it is extremely helpful to manually and carefully bend them down and in to the point that they have to be manually spread a bit to get them to go around the roof edges of the car. They really need a good spring action to get them to successfully clamp onto the car.Also, FYI: My car is a 2006 Toyota Camry 4 door and after making all necessary adjustments, this rack fits it perfectly and nice and tight. I have NO fear of it coming loose or sliding off under load stress or highway speeds!The real shame of all of these problems is that this rack is of a great and useful design, at least to me. After I corrected all of these problems, this rack is a really useful accessory.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ZESG9L3S1VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F2I13E#wasThisHelpful","R25ZESG9L3S1VJ","ADWUJZ8865J2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWUJZ8865J2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A couple of weeks ago I had to go into the crawl space under my house to check out possible problems with the air conditioning ducts and was swarmed with fleas that I later learned were living on a family of possums that were nesting there. I immediately called an extermination company and had the possums and fleas killed and removed. However, I was severely infected by the flea bites and suffered for over a week with their festering and toxicity. Nothing I tried made the infections begin healing and eventually I did some online research and discovered this chlorhexidine. After a LOT of reading about it, I decided to try it out and ordered it from Amazon. They got it to me very quickly and I immediately saturated a cotton cloth with it and began rubbing it into the festered open sores I had been troubled with. Miracle of miracles; the sores IMMEDIATELY began healing and after just 1 day, there is hardly any sore spot that hasn't closed over and started serious healing. Most of the smaller spots have almost completely disappeared and all the soreness and itching is gone. THIS STUFF IS MAGNIFICENT!I highly recommend that if you have a troubled sore spot that isn't healing well, try this stuff out. I'll never be without it the rest of my life!FYI, My research explained that this solution was perfected by some Veterinarian researchers and was originally intended for animals but it was soon learned that it was perfectly safe for use on humans. I think that I have well proven that belief. Also, the label instructions recommend that this 2% solution be further diluted but I don't seriously believe that further dilution is necessary!

"There are several very important things to be mindful of in evaluating this recording properly.1. These recordings were not made in the prime of voice and energy by Mr. Price.

It was an extremely heartfelt GOODBY to his family and to those of us who cared so much for his devotion to us!Yes, he always cared for us and his family during his good times, and I sincerely believe that he gave us the most of himself as he could in order to satisfy our enjoyment of his GREAT and DEVOTED talent in his last days.  Ray always was a giver and part of his final gift to us in these parting efforts reflects what he also thought of us, let alone providing a small amount of final financial comfort for his loving wife, Janie. I now want to use this opportunity to thank him for 'The Good Times' he gave me in just being able to hear his great and caring talent. He certainly will be missed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLI2BY95JG74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3V94T0#wasThisHelpful","R1OLI2BY95JG74","ADWUJZ8865J2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWUJZ8865J2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After almost a year of suffering from a continuing escalation of problems induced by ESET, I finally deleted ESET and installed the Trend Micro package and am ecstatic with it. It took a long time to install but it was well worth the wait. It went in without a whimper and is functioning very smoothly. It even had it's own utility for assuring the online connection of my router to the internet. The first system scan was fast (only took seconds compared to ESET's half hour) but extremely complete and it was very informative as to what it looked at and what it found.This package comes on very fast at start-up compared to ESET and is ready to go instantly (I used to have a lengthy wait time before I could check my email). It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of ESET but who cares; IT WORKS WELL AND IS FASTER, ESPECIALLY AT START-UP, AND MORE RELIABLE!I got a strong sense of real professional thought and action from the Trend folks during the installation and start-up and am eagerly looking forward to using this software.Update 5/13/2015:Starting with the use of ESET, my internet connection took quite a while. This timing was also lengthy when I first installed the Trend program. However, I have recently noticed and verified it's continuation, that the internet connection is now instantaneous and flawless every time I start up.I can only attribute this to a possible update by the Trend program which I frequently request. The more I use this program, the more I love it!!!I have now installed another copy for my wife's computer which was also using ESET. As expected, the install went without a hitch and the system, especially on start-up, is much more responsive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1745R7P590F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENFYMXO#wasThisHelpful","RA1745R7P590F","ADWUJZ8865J2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWUJZ8865J2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Camille's replacement is not a perfect replacement (how could it possibly be?) but OK and I think that she will expand and grow into the part (She IS pretty, intelligent and well made!). I am beginning to appreciate Gary Carr's replacement; Nothing personal, but in my opinion, he just didn't fit in originally; too scatterbrained and irresponsible! However, his character seems to be coming alive and he is giving Dewain a real run for his money and is beginning to contribute well into the operation of the team. He seems to grow on you and is becoming very likeable.After reading a published interview with 'Camille', I get a strong feeling that a great part of her problem with this production is bad preparation and management in directing and management in the daily routine of shooting the series which results in a serious wearing down of the performers.Want a real kick out of life, wait until you see how Harry meets Humphrey's father in episode 8!!!

"Let me start with a few comments on posted complaints. For those who are complaining about how slow this little guy is, what do you expect? This isn't a garage size compressor with a 4 inch diameter piston that runs on 110-220 volts! And, of course it's loud! How much would you like to put up with enough insulation to make it run quietly. And, who cares! Who will you be disturbing if you need this on a busy road or highway?Now for a little information for the uninitiated: I had questions about how far the thing would reach with its attached cord and the supplied air hose. If it's any help, I did tests on my 2006 Toyota Camry (a standard size sedan) and there was very ample (left over) power cord and air hose to plug this into the cigarette lighter and fill both front tires and both rear tires. And something left out of the user's directions: To fill a tire, after you remove the tire stem's screwed on cap, you have to ""screw"" the hose connector onto the valve stem and make sure that it is in straight and tight enough to keep the air from leaking while filling the tire. You can't just push it on and hold it because there isn't enough mating surface to keep it from leaking like a sieve when attempting to air up a tire. The correct set-up procedure is to connect the 12V plug into the cigarette lighter, take the pump and air hose to the tire, remove the tire's valve cap, thread the end of the hose onto the valve stem, clip the air hose connector onto the compressor and then turn the compressor on. When you have achieved the air pressure you want on the pump's pressure gauge, turn the pump off and immediately un-clip the hose from the pump (I let the pressure gauge go about 1 PSI over what I think I need just to be certain that I don't loose too much pressure in disconnecting.).Now to the rating of this little guy! I think that it is the absolute best buy you can make for truly portable insurance for the loss of air pressure under any circumstance. It is small, lightweight, portable and comes with a really neat little bag to tuck it into and toss into the trunk.

"When you cannot get it here, get it in Walmart or maybe from La Sabroza directly.  Worth it!  It's usually out of stock in Walmart too, so I order online by the case, going through a bottle per week.  Just for me.As sauce, I use it on virtually everything except breakfast cereal.  It's really great on chicken livers and rice, but of course fabuloso in any version of chili.  Very hot.But best of all, it makes a great drink.  Usually 4 oz sauce per quart of filtered water.  Chill.  Shake to drink each time.  As you probably know, when you add water to hot sauce, it gets hotter.  So the drink is much spicier than the hotsauce itself (which is very savory, alone).  Really great on hot Texan days.(I do the same thing with Louisiana brand hot sauce, but you only need about two ounces per quart.)Sabrozita taste is like half La Morena and half La Costena pickled jalapenos plus tomatillo, very savory.

"As someday you'll unhappily learn, Windows 10 takes away all your customization.  EXCEPT that somehow, this little cute program will indeed be the ONLY way you can change or fix desktop fonts, in Win10.  I used it for 64-bit Windows 10 to get the fonts I wanted for the desktop.  Else, no matter what you read on the internet (for the alleged font fixes are all 2014 fixes, no longer work) -- only this works.How?  Well, first you gotta install this on an XP or Win98 or Win95 machine, and create a theme.  Here's the key:  ALL the theme elements, including mouse, wallpaper -- must be in the Themes folder.  So place those things there before you create the theme.  Create the theme and store it also in the Themes folder.  Also, copy the fonts you used to the same folder, in case your Windows 10 won't have those fonts.That folder is inside the Plus! folder post-installation, so post install and post making the theme you'll want to use in Win10, copy the Plus! folder to Windows 10's root Program Files x86 directory.Next, in Windows 10, first check the Windows Fonts folder and see if the fonts you copied over into the Plus! folder, are in Windows 10 Fonts. Go to the latter, try to copy the fonts over, and if Win10 tells you it already has that font, then do not copy.  Else, it will auto copy.Next, still in Windows 10, create a desktop shortcut to THEMES.EXE which is in the Plus! folder, and put that shortcut on your desktop.  Then, double-click on the shortcut, and select the theme you wanted.Now, Windows 10 is borky, you know this by now;  so it won't always REMEMBER the change, nor will it show all the change, but it will remember most of the time.  If it forgets, just double-click on the shortcut again.If you want to change the theme, then you'll have to change the theme in the older Windows machine first, copy all the theme elements and the .theme file you created, to the Themes folder, and repeat the above.PS, this works in Linux too, in much the same way.

"UPSHOT: YOU TURN YOUR COMPUTER/DEVICE INTO BIG BROTHER BY AGREEMENT IN THE LICENSE AT INSTALLATION, IF YOU INSTALL WINDOWS 10.  Never before in history has such a 'license' created such awful terms.  Look in the comments for links so you can see the language for yourself.  I can't put the links in an Amazon review.SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO SEE FOR YOURSELF PRIOR TO INSTALLATION, WHAT HITLERIAN TERMS YOU'RE AGREEING TO.Installation is also extremely glitchy.  About 50% of the installers' reports I've read, are 'smooth', especially from Windows 8.1.. else, glitchy.  Given the above warning, I spend a lot of time watching how people in tenforums, wilderssecurity forums, bleepingcomputer and even microsoft community, are suffering with installing this horrible new Windows 10.  I do have it, but as an Insider.  I write extensively about it in bleeping computer and vimeo PC World Alumni forum and brainout(dot)net frankforum (latter two are my own), so you can read more there.  It has no confidential data on it, and the hard drive is removable.I personally own 16 Windows machines which are eligible for this thing 'free'.  So obviously if I found it good, would get it for them all, and say so here.But Windows 10, is scary.  First time, Windows is scary.  You'll have to see it yourself to believe it:  at least, I did.  That's why I became an Insider, first.So here, I feel I owe it to my fellow Amazonians to disclose the upshot of this awful installer:1.  It will only allow you to do a so-called 'inplace upgrade' ON TOP OF your current Window 7 or 8, which 50% of the time results in disaster.  People do it, to keep their current programs and settings.  Don't bet on this working.  Even experts are getting it wrong, see the 1st paragraph's forums.  That is also how the free version works.  Just avoid this option like the plague it is.2.  The other option is 'clean install', which here is only available if purchased.  But people who use this, are having really bad luck, and Windows help personnel always blame the seller, so make you go back to the seller.  So here, unless the seller sells you support with the license (and they usually do not), then you shouldn't buy.The problem with 'clean install' is the installer looks for a key.  The key you are supposed to provide, is a Windows 10 key.  The key you get is a Windows 10 key, but the installer often won't recognize it. When you call MSFT for help, often you're told they can't help, you must go back to the seller.  So if they are not the seller, you're s.o.l.More importantly, the license is downright frightening.  It's so much worse than turning your machine into Big Brother, but Microsoft tells you that you agree to let IT play Big Brother on you, even if you turn off all the privacy destroyers baked into the thing.  This is a series of lawsuits waiting to happen.And what do you get for all this?  Nothing you didn't already have.  Frou-frou that doesn't work:  Windows 'Hello' requires a special camera you don't have, Windows Xbox requires Xbox too, Hololens can't work yet, Cortana is a joke, Edge is a gray sheet of paper which gets papered with ads you can't get rid of, your search bar is turned into advertising if you search on the web, you can't get rid of Bing, you can't customize, there is no real Start Menu but instead a vertical version of the Win8 start Screen... and on and on with the nonsense.Oh, and no you really can't revert within 30 days, they overwrite your windows.old folder with the first Windows 10 cumulative update.  Which happens, the day or the day after, you activate.  IF IF IF you managed to activate.Do you really want to go down the rabbithole with Alice and be much poorer afterwards?  I thought not.It gets two stars for two things it does well:  it runs old software and hardware which businesses use (not consumer stuff, business stuff).. really well. I use 1980's and 1990's business hardware and software, and Win10 can work with them.  Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.The MSfanboy proselytizing is at an all-time high.  Which should warn you immediately.  If faith is warranted in God or some product, then it shouldn't need salesmen.  So if everyone's trying to 'convert' you to it, something's VERY wrong with that idea of God or that product.  Right?DISCLOSURE is one thing.  That, you need.  Selling is quite another, and the fanboys never tell you the many dark undersides to Win10.  So...PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE BUYING THIS.  Links will be in comments after this review is approved, so you can read the license fright for yourself.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PT4YY3P78CHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01019T6O0#wasThisHelpful","R3PT4YY3P78CHU","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT, 10/29/15:  the Backspace key sticks unpredictably and often, so either i have to change the keyboard settings in Windows 7 to make backspace key non-destructive, or use a different keyboard.  I reported the problam to AramediA weeks ago (it began about two weeks after purchase), and they were very nice, sending me a replacement keyboard and didn't ask for the original back.HOWEVER: the replacement stinks, literally -- like it was soaked in really sour turpentine. So does the original, but only if I put my nose near the keyboard.  Yes, after months of use, and with the screen open, fan always on, still stinks.  The replacement stinks so badly I put it in another room.  Have not yet tried it to see if the Backspace key sticks as well.I have no idea whether this edit will destroy my previous typing, as the new Amazon review system allows no preview.  So hope that doesn't happen.  Shame on you, Amazon, for changing the review input and commenting system. CHANGE IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS LAST YEAR, please.EDIT, 9/17/15:  it still smells like burning plastic (strong chemical smell).  Not quite as bad, but you don't want to be too close.  the Backspace key is starting to stick (so it won't stop deleting), but maybe I can unlock it, or change what it does.  But oh, I love typing on this keyboard, nonstop.Original review, follows below.=======30 years ago, when IBM first came out with its own 'personal computers', its model had a tank for a keyboard.  The things had a very distinct touch and LOUD clack, heavy and big.  And we loved them.This one isn't quite so heavy, but emulates the IBM right down to the pebble finish on the key surfaces, so memorable to an IBM typist.  And hooray, I don't have to look at my fingers anymore, the keys are spaced better than those cramped 'new' keyboards so faddish now!It's big.  It's bold.  It's loud.  And for the first 15 minutes outta da box, it's smelly. But it's a trip down memory lane, to type on it.I'm so sick of black I could scream, so I got this because it wasn't black.  Although, I must have a dozen other keyboards that sit in boxes.  This will be fun to use when the sun's going down and I'm too busy typing to turn the light on. NO MORE BLACK DEPRESSING KEYS, YAY!!!!At the top, also in yellow, are 11 extra keys for multimedia, kinda like the multimedia Dells:  volume, fast rewind and forward, play, mute, sleep button (lol my machine went to sleep when I touched it just now, thought I lost my typing!), Favorites, Search, Mail and Home.  The keys are all the same color and the icons saying what they are, can't be seen too well, so you have to hold the keyboard up against your nose.But they work!I really like this keyboard.  Will rerate to Five stars if it passes longevity test.  I type almost 24/7.  Never broke a keyboard yet.  This one feels like it will last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICOIGYUW4LNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C1U8XG#wasThisHelpful","R3ICOIGYUW4LNI","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cloning TipsWD has backup software I never use, but instead these little drives are great for cloning.  What's that?  Well, it's far better than backups, as I'll next try to explain.Linux has a program called 'Clonezilla' which functions as a standalone program for cloning, purchasable in Amazon for $10 or less (CD is better than stick version), or download free at sourceforge dot net (or you can get it in Linux Mint's Package Manager).  A 'clone' is an exact physical replica of a hard drive, which means its files are LIVE and BOOTABLE.  Very much better than 'backup' or 'image'.It is a lifesaver, but to clone rightly, you need a drive the same size or bigger, as the drive you'll be cloning TO.  Bigger is sometimes a problem, because with Linux you don't need much space, and you're better off storing your data separately from the OS.  (They tell you otherwise, but Linux' filesystem is from hell, so the 'home' directory they tout is a nightmare to actually use.  Frankly, the same is true for Windows.)Now you need Linux if you routinely use Windows, as Linux can do better file management, surfing, DVD writing, partitioning than Windows can.  And, if Windows dies, Linux can rescue all your files, correct your boot record (the usual cause of Windows failures), and many other nifty things.  Best of all, Clonezilla makes a LIVE COPY of your Windows system so you can use the files, boot, clone back to your Windows-update-trashed drive when needed.  So when Windows crashes, you just clone back to your drive, and in 20 minutes you're good as new (so long as the problem isn't your hardware). You can do this clone daily at the end of the day, or beginning, while you shower or something.  Thus you always have a fresh live copy of everything.  Hence the value of these little drives, for you can take your computer with you, entire!So you need two Linux distros (can't only have one), and Clonezilla if you want instant repair of all things Windows.  I learned this the hard way five years ago.  The two distros which work the best are Mint (currently 17), and either Fedora or Debian.  These latter two are big-house distros major corporations use, and have glitches, but they are full-featured.  Avoid Ubuntu, if you value flexibility and sanity.  (Ubuntu is only good if you never saw a computer before, or you only write your own program code.  Its graphical interface is vaguely like a Mac, and is very annoying to most.)So to make a live Linux distro, you need Clonezilla (sold here in Amazon or freely downloadable at Sourceforge, just Google);  and, a USB stick (I prefer Kingston or Patriot);  plus, one of these little drives.  Finally, you also need another external drive which is the same size or bigger than, your Windows' machine's drive, if you plan to clone for Windows.The objective is to create an external drive and stick which has one distro(=Linux nickname for 'OS'), then do it again for another distro.  So for that, you download a good distro: Mint 17 is easiest to download, install, learn.  So then burn its iso to DVD, then select its 'install' -- and then the place you install TO will be either the stick, or one of these little drives.  Use the little drive, first.  Make sure the stick is same or bigger than the drive, hence the importance of a small drive, as the biggest stick is still only 128 GB.With Mint, installation is slick and fast, with two simple questions up front and an internet connection:  takes maybe 40 minutes using a stick (faster, if using one of these little hard drives).  Be aware that 'sda' is your internal hard drive's 'name' in Linux, so you don't want that (they order drive names with 'sd' and then in alpha order, internal-drives-first).Note carefully the SIZE of the drive, so you're sure of picking the right one to install TO (again, an advantage of these small drives).  When installation ends, you'll be told and then you can reboot and configure Mint as you choose: you can do taskbars and tool bars and cascading menus with it just like XP or Win7, as well as backgrounds, slideshows, any coloring you like for the menus.  It has an automatic updater, plus a bunch of 'packages' (programs) you can select to install, very easy to do.  Be sure to pick 'GParted' and 'Clonezilla' (search on those names, and the 'package' will come up, witn one-click installation).  Updating and installation of the hundreds of packages will take maybe 2 hours.  It's pretty seamless.After you get it as you choose, then you can use Clonezilla as a standalone (not within Mint), to CLONE the installation you just finished to a stick, so you turn off the machine, boot using only Clonezilla offline; then select the drive you'd just installed to as the source, and the stick as the 'target', doing a 'local' 'device' or 'drive' installation.  This will take a long time, maybe overnight (took me overnight to do it on a Fedora clone of 64 GB).So now, you have one distro on both stick and hard drive.  The stick will run slower, but you can plug that stick into any machine you have, and your machine will stay unaffected.  A real boon when travelling:  say you have an old XP netbook you love, but now you can't use it online due to XP's vulnerability.  No problemo, just stick in the stick:  browsers like Firefox run natively in Linux.  You can still copy files, etc., and many of your fonts/cursors can be recognized and used in Linux, too.Now to the Windows cloning.  You want to clone TO an external drive which is the same size or larger than the Windows root.  So again, you use Clonezilla as a standalone, this time specifying your Windows drive as the source, then the external drive as the target: takes about 20 minutes to clone a 70 GB Windows 7 drive to an external, using Clonezilla.  (If the target drive is bigger, you'll have 'unallocated' space left over, which you can later partition and use in other ways. Linux can partition better than Windows.)Now here's the best part:  you can then take that cloned drive and in Linux (i.e., Mint) using Clonezilla -- clone the clone again, this time to a stick.  That saves space.  Windows XP can boot from the stick thus made, so presumably later Windows can, too.  Aha.  But even if not, you can clone the stick in Clonezilla back to your hard drive.  Great again, if travelling.Enfin, having a small drive for cloning helps you save time in cloning, and makes the Windows messups less troublesome when they occur, for you can always clone back using Clonezilla.So why the second distro?  Because sometimes you have to partition or do other stuff ON the distro which it won't let you do.  So if you have a second distro which is not of the same 'family' you can make otherwise prohibited changes.  Ergo the need for a clone and a second distro, in case those changes go wrong.  I did this with Fedora 22 as my second distro, but it is nowhere as useful as Mint (no Clonezilla, and you have to severally download Gparted from Fedora's 'Apper', which is annoying).  Debian is another choice, but both Fedora and Debian are more complex to install, and Fedora's updating is horrendous.  I chronicled the procedure as 'Fedora 22 installation horrors' in vimeo 'PC World Alumni Group': you can Google on the title, to find the listing.  With Fedora, you do NOT want to have an internal hard drive installed on your machine.  So take it out, or clone the internal drive first.  Fedora writes to that drive, can't stop it unless there's NO drive.Debian is buggy, too.  So pick maybe some other distro, but do pick a second one.  (Mint is a hybrid, half Ubuntu and half Debian.)Now, if you're on Windows 8 there are other problems, as Windows 8 requires a kind of lock on the BIOS so you can't just clone with it as simply as described above.  There are workarounds, but too much has to be said to explain.  So treat the above as good for cloning Windows 7 and prior.  I think your machine has to have 1 GB of RAM for Clonezilla or any Linux distro to work, though maybe some allow for lower RAM (like Puppy or DamSmall Linux, neither of which I've tried).If I'm unclear, yell at me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R329W6IJNI7TUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JHKI5U#wasThisHelpful","R329W6IJNI7TUZ","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever notice how website and most other product design has tanked?  As if the designers lost the ability to test and think?  Well, most ethernet cables now are horrible, with that plastic clip at the end usually the worst:  either the clear plastic breaks off easily, or the 'snagless' design elected makes it nearly impossible to put the clip into the back of the modem or machine.This one, is happily better.

Far preferable to the slide or glide version, since the slider gets stuck so it's hard to insert.  These little babies don't have that problem.What also distinguishes these little puppies is their narrowness.  As you might know, on lappies there is often very little vertical or horizontal space between USB ports (esp. on Dell Latitude 6510 and 6530, which piggyback the ports).  So often, when my normally-fav Kingston Data Traveler won't fit, these will.Wish they came in 3.0, but I'll take what I can get.The 'axle' will sometimes pop off, but that doesn't hurt the data or the dongle.  Easy to label, too.I use 'em nearly every day, no complaints about data retention.  Have reformatted them in Linux as well.  If you partition then format these with only 2 GB as FAT16, you'll 'fool' programs requiring only 2 GB for USB boots, yet the remaining partition can still store data (but only Linux can see it).If you're worried about losing them, put a keyring around the 'axle', or pop it off, put on the keyring, then pop it back on again.  They fit well in coin holders.

"EDIT: see below the second set of === marks for comments on the DVD set, which I just got.  Original review below is for buying some episodes ON Amazon.  I also bought the full DVD set as a result, from another vendor.===============..with a nod to the Rumplestiltskin story, a generous dash of Buffy wryness and James Joyce's Ulysses wit.  You know, his book focusing on the inner petty thoughts:'Dang my johnson, gotta get me sum poon tang.'  Or, per the movie, 7+ minutes into Season 4, Episode 2, 'You smell like Dinner': numnuts anti-Vamp guy outside 'Fangtasia', among picketers contra 'fangbangers', says in rejoinder, 'I am a Christian, goddammit'.Or, as 'Jason' proudly says in the Season Five Finale, with his 'dad' smiling on the couch:  'If I want to be a fool, then I will be a fool.  That is my God-given right as an American.'Then there are the sight gags, such as the one, halfway through Season 5's finale, of a vampire receptionist reading 'Marketing Basics' textbook against a wall of partly Greek Bible-mss type script: most of the letters and some of the words are real Greek, replete with diacritics, but some are Aramaic or even Roman alphabet letters.  Just above her head is the (pseudo?) word 'archomonou', which is not in the Bible, = 'archos' (leader) + monos in the genitive='only', play on monogenes in John 3:16.Gems like that abound.  So this isn't your typical vamp show, and the combo of script writing, camera work, direction, acting is sheer genius on so many levels I have to watch each episode several times a session;  each time, I find yet another layer I missed before.Wit like that, is priceless.  This series plays it coy, though.  The satire is slow-cooked, seeping heatedly up through the episodes:  by Season 4 Episode 1 -- an episode I wanna watch over and over and over -- Jonathan Swift, has taken over.  And you got hooked.  :)I didn't think anything could top the Buffy series for varied wit.. but this does.  Though the spoofing begins in the very first scene of the series, you don't catch onto that until later.  If you are considering a career in acting, directing, film editing or production -- you MUST watch this series.Yeah, and after you watch this series, you'll NEVER EVER EVER wanna* view or have sex again,* see ANY naked bodies, even your own;* use the f word,* go near a southern rural area, especially at night;* attend covens, circles, seances, jump-or-sing-or-give-for-Jesus churches, or anything supernatural;* hear that horrific, loud, annoying, ugly opening and closing music, nor the Cajun fake or real or any hillbilly accent sported by the cast;* wear or even glimpse, red.I will personally boycott the opening song and every closing song.  HORRIBLE that they play a minute or two of real episode (no recaps) before that awful song comes on, just as was so horrifically popular in Smallville and Grimm.  RUDE, okay?  Loudness in LCD TVs is much worse due to audio compression.  So you're constantly futzing with the sound.  Probably the ugly music is intended, to match the ugly story line.The series overflows with ALL of the above, and YES it's all necessary to the story (the sex is plentiful, graphic, usually tawdry, ugly, but vital to the story line).  So it's tragi-comic, self-deprecating, at times farcical; how the actors manage to deliver their lines well, I do not know.  I couldn't do it with a straight face.Yet for all that, the series is quite profound.  Frankly, if you carried out the devil's goals in the 3 Temptations of Matthew or Luke 4, the world painted in this True Blood series would result. FYI, Luke surgically tracks and wraps Matthew's Gospel verbatim (see my Synoptics channel on vimeo which shows his style);  then, Luke reverses the 2nd & 3rd Temptation to make the 2nd his chapter theme, re Satan's twisting Psalm 91.  Seems like one of this series' writers, employs the same literary device.  Thus you get, self-righteous silliness abutting animalistic silliness.  Cinched with wry wit, in between: 'So I recommend an iron supplement.. and vitamin B twice daily', says Vamp Bill after drinking a bartender.  Call all that, Satan's 'Modest Proposal'.I absolutely hated the first episode in Season One, but due to the brilliant acting, kept watching, then got hooked.  The plot and acting always stay on the edge of campy, yet so over-the-top with the sex thang, the swearing silly religion thang:  spoofing all of them, yet not disparaging Bible or God.  The series draws a line between whatever or whoever God and Bible really are, versus those claiming to believe in either/both.  Series then mocks and somewhat cuddles ALL practitioners: as weak, frail, scared.. hypocrites.By Season Five, storyline transitions from the small Louisiana town to the big picture of vamps trying to live with humans, and their own political divergence -- yet always with a campy undertow.  Example, its Episode 1, when this shift to macro reaches full steam -- an erstwhile 'Christian' vampire hater screams at his prey, 'Love Me!'  Yeah, and at the other end you have the vamps' own faith, own Bible.. in which God is Vampyr.  Cute play on Lilith myth, too: series twists that myth, just as most people twist Bible.And unlike many reviewers here, I liked the way it ended:  the series' slow-cooked beginning has alike a slo-mo yet surprising, ending.  VERY well done.  Perfect, even.Enfin, this series is often a sympathetic yet honest look at how we all suck 'God' dry and then call ourselves holy.  Very clever.  Some of the other reviews castigate the script writing from Season Five onward, claiming Ball left;  I don't see the basis for their complaint.  Again, Jonathan Swift would be proud.  Or God, for that matter, as the satire here is very much like Bible's own Hebrew and Greek text (i.e., Genesis 1:2 where the Holy Spirit casts Himself as a mother hen, Hebrew verb rahaph).So if you're into political correctness of ANY flavor, do NOT watch this series, as nothing is sacred.  The LGBT community is satirized, as too all straights, religious, or self-styled free-thinkers, moralists, nudists, traditionalists and 'my family my family my family' folk.  The series makes fun of them all, shows up the tawdry nature of all human pretensions and frailties by using vampires, werewolves and other skin walkers/shape-shifters, po' white and non-white trash.  Series is gruesome, hard to watch yet compelling.  I can only stand it, 15 minutes at a time.  But I find myself returning to watch again and again, maxima mea culpa.How much this series diverges from the books by Ms. Harris I don't know, but other reviewers cover that.  What I do know, is that this series is horrific, yet wholly brilliant.  I wish Jonathan Swift were alive to see it.============About the DVD set:It's really each individual season boxed together.  So if you've got the individual seasons, this complete set doesn't offer anything different.  However, unlike other HBO series I've bought (Game of Thrones, for example), THIS one is easy to navigate and has 'hours and hours' of features, just as claimed; plus a handy index, as well as the usual Languages options.  Frankly, the resolution is only 480p even on my 1080p HD TV, and also the Amazon episodes are better resolution even in SD;  that is, using a commercial DVD player.  If played instead on my computer's DVD (Win7), I get full 1080p resolution on the same TV (which is a second monitor for my Win7 computer).  Seriously, if you have a choice between playing this on computer versus on your TV with a commercial DVD player, pick the computer.  The LAG using a DVD player for TV is awful, and you can't bypass the first minute or so of play easily.Some reviewers here claim that after Alan Ball allegedly stopped writing (Season Five was supposedly his last), that the series goes downhill.  I beg to differ.  It just gets better every season.  I've never been so enamored of a series as this, watching it over and over again.  So the above comments about the genius of the series, stand.  It's not really about vampires, but about society.  What Frank Herbert and Isaac Asimov did for science fiction, 'True Blood' does for the vampire genre. Again, how it compares to the books I don't know, nor do I care.  This is one of the greatest series I've ever seen of any kind for its variety of satire and yet profundity.  And despite all the nudity, f words, graphic violence and what most people would call satanism, it never disparages Bible or God, but rather keeps begging the question of AUDITING one's beliefs.  Since the latter is my internet theme (i.e., brainout.net and brainout on vimeo), obviously I would find that undertheme quite important.  Maybe you will, too.  Sometimes you hear the writers talk about it in the audio commentary or the many 'Inside the Episode' vignettes.Nearly every disk has at least one episode with writers or actors talking through it, saying little of importance to the storyline: they instead mostly focus on the technical details of shooting, on the actors and their experience while shooting.  Many episodes, especially beginning in Season Four, have one or more 'Inside the Episode' snippets of up to 8 minutes, often saying little about the story line that you didn't already know; but it's interesting to hear their perspective.Season One's last disk also has 'Beverage ads' in English and French (the French one is quite different and adorable), 'Vampire service ads' and 'Public Service Announcements on 'Vampire Rights' and 'Vampires in America' mockumentary which are kinda cute.Season Two's last disk has 'The Vampire Report' and 'Fellowship of the Sun: Reflections of Light': these are really campy, too, mocking TBN rather aptly and baldly, with rampant misuse of Scripture.  The latter is divided into four subparts.  About 40 minutes' worth, altogether (both features).For Season Three -- which begins the shift to the 'big picture' about how vampires are organized worldwide -- two disks have special features:  Disk 1 (episode 1-2) has 'Anatomy of a Scene', plus 'Post Mortem' running almost 14 minutes (some of the material is repeated), about how they used real wolves and how they effected the 'transformation' into humans.  Also, an interesting audio commentary on Episode 2 with Alex Skarsgard, better than the usual Episode-long (nearly an hour) audio commentary while the full episode plays, despite the fact most of the comments are about the technicalities of shooting.  For these commentaries, it's a good thing to turn subtitles on.  Yes you can have English subtitles though the language selected for play, is also English.Season Three's last disk contains bonus features on fairies and a commentary about Season 4 (sum is about 3.5 minutes), under the label 'Post Mortem',  plus some 19 minutes of (six) 'minisodes' which seem like deleted scenes: they are really good, too, filling in some minor plot holes which got glossed over during Season Two and Three.  Plus, Snoop Dog's 'Oh Sookie' 3-minute music video (not my taste, but maybe is yours).  The fairies' bit you can also watch for free in Amazon;  see the bottom of the Season 3 page in Amazon.Season Four, besides the usual audio commentary, the last disk of the season has 'Inside the Episodes' of about 10 minutes.  Also, there's a 28.5 minute segment called 'True Blood: the Final Touches' on the post-production work in the series.  It's useful if you're interested in how movie/series are made.Season Five and Six's disks continue that trend;  the disks have audio commentary and most have up to 10 minutes of 'Inside the Episodes'.  Amazon has some free specials for Season Five which I didn't find on the DVDs.  No bonus features are listed on the disks.So too, for Season 7.  Its ending Episode 10 disk is followed with an Epilogue 'Farewell to Bon Temps' as a Bonus Feature, with Alan Ball and each of the major actors talking about how the series affected them.  It's well worth watching, and runs 28 minutes.As usual, the folks who made the casing (those awful hubs which make you PRY the DVD so you're likely to break it);  they did a poor job of the navigation options for DVD players, but are great and fast, if you play on your computer.  Even so, these DVDs are far better than the Game of Thrones DVDs, and unlike the latter hallelujah you DO get Scene Selection (missing, from GoT Season 4, for example).Thank you for your time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Q97612OWM6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GM8NXM#wasThisHelpful","R17Q97612OWM6X","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a reason why this edition is free:  Gibbon's Greek notes or quotes are instead transcribed as ""[GREEK TEXT]"".  Never get Kindle for anything to do with Greek or non-Romanized letters.  Frankly, Kindle has gotten much worse over the last two years.  As if the people working there hated their customers.  Kindle's interface is horrible, now.  You can no longer copy or use it for citations you can paste into your research, and if you complain (good luck figuring out how to send them a messasge, and NEVER use the forum, it's populated by vultures) -- if you manage to complain, no one listens.  I SO regret all my many Kindle purchases.So I guess now they gotta give it away;  pity, because the original Kindle program five years ago, was to die for: a real boon to researchers.In Ebay, I'm bidding on a CD version of Gibbon (already have two hardbacks and a full set on 3.5"" floppies).

"Although Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors on the planet, he can't save this detestable Americanized remake of the original BBC version starring Ian Richardson.  Script in this American version is boooorrrrriiinnngg and lacking the rich detail of the original.  I forced myself to watch it.  The key lines in the BBC original were replicated and POORLY.  Direction was absent, the dialogue was hackneyed.  The opening scene with the dog and the 'aside' (drama term where the actor talks directly to the audience, also used in the BBC production) was the only good one.Lackluster cast, but then what kind of script do they have?  Garbage.  West Wing this is not.  Seriously, I had to start and end and start the video over and over like a C-grade movie you tell yourself you must finish because you paid for it.  Fire the scriptwriter, fire the director, fire whoever handles the sound because it's bad, nearly inaudible.  And God bless Kevin Spacey for living out his contract.  Every day I'd regret signing on, were I him.Final Cut?  Bleh.  The BBC ending of the same Final Cut title is to-die for.  This American one, who cares.

"Some months back, I got these and also nolie's naturals, to compare which was better, since nolie's is about 30% more expensive.  The price difference, is due to nolie's having more ingredients that ease vascular constriction (chiefly horse chestnut, bilberry and avena sativa).  So I bought the extra ingredients here in Amazon, then added them to this Harry formula, to see if there was a difference both with and without, the added ingredients.  Versus, the nolie's.Yet the nolie's still worked better, even though I doubled the Harry's dosage with the added ingredients doubled as well.  By this time the Harry pills, coupled with the added ingredients, were more expensive than nolie's.  Even after a month of use, the Harry version here, was less effective.  But the nolie's, though more effective, wasn't quite good enough.Disheartened and in desperate need of a solution, I doubled the max mineral oil dose (which is usually listed as three tablespoons) daily for a week, and stopped pills entirely.  That high a dose of mineral oil worked, and well;  but it took a week or more, to seep through.  Prior, I'd tried the pills in combination with lesser mineral oil doses daily for some weeks, to little effect.Notice that since fecal impaction from constipation is the CAUSE of hemorrhoids, the 'rhoids themselves should shrink over time, due to lack of straining.  So no surgery, certainly worth a try.  The only caveat is to take the mineral oil on an empty stomach, lest fat soluble vitamins like A and D, be rendered invalid.  So take at bedtime: or eat at least an hour afterwards, so these vitamins will absorb.Google on 'I always feel bloated', which is the primary symptom of fecal impaction, meaning stools don't pass because they are too dry (need to drink much more water); or, because you're not eating enough fiber.  The problems can be antithetical;  if too dry, then eating fiber makes the problem worse.  Gets to where you can't eat solids anymore.  Since hemorrhoids come from decades of prolonged constipation, hemorrhoids are considered an old person's disease.So fecal impaction can be decades old, won't be noticed until severe.  That was my problem (heh, I'm full of doo-doo, it figures).  So try smaller mineral oil doses for a week, see what effect it has.  Try senna also in small doses, daily.  They build up; only if you get no results after a week, should you go to the high levels I did.  And of course, don't do anything without consulting your physician.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBKLVEJHYSMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFH4SP6#wasThisHelpful","R2NBKLVEJHYSMH","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was going to return this.  Providentially, when I started the return and then waited TWO DAYS for UPS to pick it up and they didn't, I then changed the return to my taking the thing to a UPS dropoff.  Since that would cost more in my time than the pitcher, it then seemed best to buy the cheaper Mavea filters, which apparently lack the foibles of Brita filters (actually both have the same flaws, but Brita is more expensive).So just now I cancelled the return, and here's how the pitcher needs to be improved:1.  MAKE THE HANDLE SOLID, not hollow:  mold will accumulate in the hollow handle, in six months or so.  Since the pitcher is wildly overpriced, that's too much expense for something going bad every six months due to poor design.  To stave off the mold, only use the pitcher to make batches of potable water you'll store in other containers, so the pitcher can dry out.  The filter will have to stay wet, but that's an easy task:  just put it in a large-enough jar or glass you can cover and keep in the fridge.2.  Make the Pitcher wider and shorter:  the style is quite ungainly and heavy.  It's only good for filtering water, not for using the pitcher.  Horrible to use, but the filtering works well.  So change the SHAPE, somehow.3.  Make the pitcher out of more pliable plastic: the current plastic used, is brittle and smells.  YES you have to wash the pitcher and resevoir with soap upon removing it from the box, the smell is overwhelming.  Brittle plastic and the ungainly shape combine to make for easy breakage.  So why not redesign the plastic to be the same as for distilled water, with a shape like a gallon of that water, commonly sold in stores?  You just need a wider mouth.  Again, because the pitcher is so overpriced, keeping the current design will result in revenue loss to Brita.  For sooner or later, people will get sick of the hassle and cost.Time is money.  At some point the time spent using the pitcher will outweigh the small savings versus buying and lugging gallon bottles of distilled or 'spring' water.  But for immediate gratification, and if you use the pitcher in batches to make 'clean' water you then transfer to other bottles, it's useful.  (The filter can be submerged in a smaller jar between uses.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LUXQ2BKQTXLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GNGID0#wasThisHelpful","R2LUXQ2BKQTXLE","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Houston water is notorious for being over chlorinated.  Same as Los Angeles water, Chicago water.  So I had high hopes this filter would work.  Granted, I've only done the three-initial-rinse throughs (product description claims you don't need these, but filter box descriptions says yes the first two or three must be poured out or on plants.  The fourth is sitting now and no discernible reduction in chlorine when I tasted it.Will let it sit an hour, see if that makes a difference.  EDIT:  it does make a difference.  For the test, I submerged the filter in a spouted, glass milk/beer pitcher (you know, the kind used in US restaurants, back in the 1970's).  It didn't make a lot of difference, but it made some.Then, because I still have a Brita pitcher I was going to return, I put the Mavea filter into the Brita after having washed the pitcher (and yeah, it needs washing, smells horrible right outta da box).  At first, I just filled the pitcher with the pre-filtered water, not reading the instructions.  No difference versus submerged.  So, I emptied the pitcher.  Then, I READ the instructions, and only filled up the resevoir in the top of the pitcher, as per the instructions.  This is a much slower process, for the water in the resevoir slowly drips down into the pitcher.  At which point, YES there is a big difference in taste.So now I'll go back to submerge and do it longer.  For that pitcher is awful: too big, too heavy, plastic too brittle, and the handle is HOLLOW so eventually it will crud up with mold.  For you have to keep the filter wet.  So I'm thinking constant submergence is better, anything to avoid that badly-designed pitcher.  Will report back later.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1464A56ALX2SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUO9BFO#wasThisHelpful","R1464A56ALX2SH","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT, 5/31/15:  I now have three of the 128GB sticks.  Also, I've now read the other reviews and I think I can explain why there are complaints:A.  No 3.0 flash drive works at that speed unless it's put in a NATIVE 3.0 port.  By NATIVE, I mean 1) the Anker 3.0 hub you can buy here at Amazon, which I used to test, and why I posted my initial 'Lightning' review (below), or 2) the actual port in the machine itself is 3.0, i.e., in a Dell 6530 (which has a 3.0 port).  It might also work with the 3.0 cards you can slip in laptops, but I didn't test that.  See:  if the hub is separately powered from the computer and itself is all 3.0, then you get 3.0 speed from the drive.  Else, you don't.  The slowest 'connection' into the machine is what governs speed, not the stick itself.  So if you used a 3.0 hub separately powered, but a 2.0 extension cable, then 2.0 is what you get.  If the ONLY connection between stick and machine is 3.0, then  you get 3.0 speed, which is lightning on this drive.Example:  I had to change webhosts for my brainout.net domain, and download my entire domain from the old host to the new one on this stick.  It was what prompted the 'Lightning' review, because that's how fast the transfer occurred.  I was shocked.B.  To make a bootable flash drive in Linux is tricky.  It's not the fault of the flash drive, but of the distro.  First problem is to get persistence, which so far I've only gotten with Mint 13 (which thereafter won't recognize '/cow' but does have persistence anyway) and with Fedora 17.  Both of those distros are now outdated, but not only do they work fine (esp. Fedora, which has its own proprietary program for making a persistent stick), but you can CLONE them with Clonezilla.So that's really the better avenue.  Create a new distro or clone your hard drive with the distro of choice -- use a genuine external HDD for that.  Then, clone that hard drive TO the stick using only Clonezilla (not via the distro).  It takes ages to clone because Clonezilla isn't equipped for 3.0 transfers;  my 64GB clone took overnight.  But it works fabulously.  In fact, that's a big reason I bought three of these puppies, I plan to clone my existing distros onto sticks.  But the catch is, due to Linux limitations you first must INSTALL to a regular external HDD. After you do that, futz with the options to customize it to your liking, then clone to a stick using only Clonezilla (again, you can't be in the distro to clone).So:  I installed Mint 13 to an external HDD, then customized it to my liking, then clone to the flash drive.  Any flash will work, but this one is easier to use and has a smaller footprint.  Remember when cloning, if you clone to a stick, make sure the drive you're cloning from is smaller than the stick.  You'll have unallocated space left on the stick, which you can partition using GParted, afterwards.  Hope this helps.C.  Reports of the flash not working aren't due to the flash but the need for the USB port to be flushed out.  I must own 25 or 30 flash drives, and all of them at times seem not to work, until I put them in another computer or wait some hours.  Then they work just fine.  I think it's a problem with the USB port not accepting a flash drive which has too quickly been in another machine.  The problem is intermittent and I'm not sure that the CAUSE of the problem is what I say here. I'm only sure of the remedy, which is to wait and insert, or reboot the machine and insert, or take it out and wait 10+ minutes and re-insert.  This is a big problem in Windows, so maybe it's not a hardware problem?Original review follows below.====================I really didn't expect the 3.0 to be much better than the 2.0 for this 128 (really 115) GB size, but the 3.0 is definitely faster.  That's only true if plugged into a 3.0 USB, however (I used Anker 3.0 external USB hub, available here in Amazon).  So if you don't have any 3.0 USB ports on your machine, you'd be better off with a 2.0 stick.Then again, this one is cheaper, too.

"When in the first 30 seconds of the film you find blatant disregard of Bible, then it's time to stop watching.  Examples:  per Bible but contradicted needlessly in the movie, JEREMIAH found the Bible in the Temple, and he was an ADULT, not a child.  He was already at least 20 years old when called by God, and Josiah had just turned age 21 (13th year of Josiah in Jer 1:1-3 plus 2 Kings 22:1 says he was 8 years old upon accession, which also means the kingdom was badly run).  Hebrew na'ar means a man of MARRIAGEABLE AGE not a child, Jeremiah 1:6.  He was the son of the High priest who was so dang dumb about Bible, Jeremiah's father didn't even know what the book WAS and had to ask Huldah the robe cleaning lady about it, 2 Kings 22 again.Saddest thing is, the Bible's story is a lot more juicy.  Jeremiah was called by God to eschew the High Priesthood which as a son of Aaron he should have become, his own father who was the High Priest was a dufus, and collaborated with the dufus king to put Jeremiah in a SEWER ('cistern' is the translation, and that's such a coverup!) -- so the father was against his own son. Unlike the movie naturlich -- Jeremiah had no lovers, no love interests, only God, see Jeremiah 1.  So the story claiming he had a romance was just invented. The truth was far more juicy for a producer to sell:  they used to have male prostitutes in the Temple for crying out loud (a practice instituted under Manasseh, see 2 Kings 21-23 and 2 Chron 33-35).So any smart producer would make more money by actually telling the BIBLE's story, rather than twisting or ignoring what it says.  Yet instead, a flop is made, like this movie.  Nearly every Bible movie is a flop production.  Just as no one ever makes a decent movie about Passion Week, which PER BIBLE shows FOUR DAYS OF SEVEN TRIALS between 10 and 14 Nisan (March 31 and April 3 each year, generally, going by Exodus 12, SOLAR YEAR never lunar and nothing like that insanity they call 'Easter computus' which is as anti-Biblical as it gets) -- a Mosaic Law timing which when He died, went from 'deemed' passover to actual Passover because they didn't intercalate.So not Biblical though alleging to be Biblical, and not a good production: hackneyed script, staging, characters, amateurish camera and directing.  It gets two stars for the actors, like Vince Regan, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and Oliver Reed.Enfin: believe or don't believe in Bible, that's your free right.  But if you claim a Bible story then you'd better use the Bible to tell it: for anyone can check your story, and if you didn't use the Bible, all your own credibility dies.  Even a brainout then knows you were incompetent -- or dishonest -- in making the movie.  Lots of revenue lost as a result.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LE97YVRGM2XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVYLA4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1LE97YVRGM2XZ","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just give up on any movie ever being even remotely like the Bible;  for example, Bible NEVER SAYS that when the Rapture happens, millions of people will just disappear.  Instead, Paul laid out a 'time map' for Church in Ephesians 1:3-14's Greek which is so grim, the picture at the end is that there are few Christians left, when Rapture happens: a kind of winter of discontent, in Eph 1:13-14.  So it happens, because no one will believe, anymore.  I've been documenting how you can prove all that since 2010, see my vimeo paulmeterggs11 channel and watch the videos in order: they go through the Greek text and the FUTURE HISTORY (relative to AD 58) until Odovacer.  For by then, Church is so stagnant, believers are few.  That was back in AD 476!  All the NT books are on the same subject, too, 'tagging' the Ephesians timeline with additions (most notably, in 1 John and Revelation).  Been doing videos showing that, and have only just started proving the text.UPSHOT: Bible's own version, is that almost no one is left, to Rapture (not like English, 'rapto' in Latin means to SNATCH UP VIOLENTLY, translating the original Greek verb harpazw in 1Thess 4:17, one of the better-known Rapture verses).  Instead, Revelation 11 says that on the first day of the Tribulation, two JEWS show up at Temple to protect the Holy of Holies from anyone entering, with the power to withhold rain, throw fire, all that stuff no one ever believes.  THEY announce what happened, along with an angel flying at high noon.  John writes Revelation following Aristotle's Poetics, so creates what back then would be called a quadrilogy, three tragedies and an ending comedy (as in happy ending, not haha).  So the Greek readers understood him well.  We stopped teaching our kids to read Greek of Bible within 100 years of Revelation's writing (back in AD 88 per John's own dateline in the book).  So we do NOT know how to read it.  So all our Bible movies about 'the Apocalypse' are completely wrong.So if you want to make a good story everyone will disbelieve anyway, then pick the Real Bible's Real Story.  Not, this junk.Even so: if you ignore the fact that this movie -- like every other Bible movie ever made, just repeats Bible words, and in reality has little to do with Bible -- if you ignore all that, you'll find this movie thought-provoking at a basic level:  does God exist?  If the God of the Bible were true, and if mankind was sick of Him 'not showing up', what would the world want instead?The entire Apocalypse series is amateurishly shot (cameraman maybe was badly directed), middling to great acting, hackneyed script.  Left Behind should be left behind in the trash, for the writers wouldn't know Bible if it bit them;  and, for the most part, so should this series: but the acting is worth watching.  The actors did well with the poor material they had.Judgment itself, is a bit better than the rest of the series, as it aims to also be an amalgam of two very good shorts:  Twilight Zone Season 2 Episode 29 'Obsolete Man' (which Prime members can watch for free online, Amazon Instant Video) and another great oldie starring Vincent Price as the Devil, called 'The Story of Mankind'.  You'll notice that the main 'stage' in this movie, 'Judgment', is about the same.  So kudos to the writers or director for at least nodding to those other two movies.  Much of the bad script can be forgiven, as it too is like those oldies.Able acting all around, and thank God this time Nick (hahaha nickname for The Devil) Mancuso didn't go over the top with his acting (and maybe he was directed to be so goofball in the rest of the series, so just did his job).  So it's worthwhile to watch THIS film.  The others are too childish and anti-Biblical to be of much use.Bible's story, however, is actually quite political, as Bible is always persona non-grata even as God and the Jews always are: which of course begs the question, why THEM more than all other religious claims and ideas and books?  Aha.  So maybe this is the right story the actual truth? But it's not a nice or comfortable story, and if the truth, it's one any sane person would want to disbelieve, every day.No Christian can tell the story rightly, and as a Bible addict who makes videos on the Greek and Hebrew (in vimeo), I'm not sure I can either: for it takes YEARS of understanding the real Bible, to even know what the story.. is.  You can know the story, but telling it rightly is another kettle of fish.  Essentially, God lets you decide if you want Him or not, but if you do, then you have to understand that He's Righteous and you are not, so BELIEVE HIS SON PAID FOR YOUR SINS and you are forever saved from hell, when you die.What recommends this movie is that in the mouth of Corbin Bernsen, that last sentence was made clear.  First Bible movie I've ever seen which actually repeated the Gospel, correctly.  Hence 3 stars, minimum.Okay, but what about your life down here?  Seems like God doesn't get involved or care.  That's not true, but you don't know that.  Sooner or later, it should occur to you.. to ASK the ceiling, as it were: and that's when the answers begin.  You are to learn this old book (great lines about 'old book' in the movie), and it seems utterly irrelevant to your current life.  Just the opposite is true, but you won't know that until you've spent a decade or more learning that Book.So then, the premise of this movie, is quite apt:  WHERE IS GOD?  If He really exists, really paid for your sins, WHY WON'T HE SHOW UP?  Yeah, good question.  And that, dears, is the heart of this movie.  It never answers the question, either.  People ask the question daily, too: complaining.  So, they don't get answers.  We Christians have answers no one wants.  And we don't know the answers any too well, as we like everyone else, don't really ASK as we should.So maybe watch the movie just to see the QUESTION, and then maybe ask yourself if you too want the answer.  If not, then not.  But there are consequences.  You know what they are.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDBZMTQTGH9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000059MPN#wasThisHelpful","R1MDBZMTQTGH9L","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can put a full leg of chicken in the lower bowl and then 'top' it obversely with the other, and microwave.  (Really quick meal: squirt mustard, catchup, soy/Worcestershire sauce over the frozen leg, mix them a little, nuke for 10 minutes.)  Don't be too careful about fitting the two bowls on each other, leave the top bowl a bit 'off' so air can escape during microwaving.They are essentially non-stick, they stack well, position easily in the dishwasher, are practically unbreakable.  I think they are oven safe to 350 degrees, but haven't tried that.My only complaint is that Corelle doesn't offer them in solid colors.The seller packed them right on top of each other, only the label on the bottom (easily removed), and no cardboard in between.

"I'm an over-the-door addict.  I hate having to look for stuff, so I hang things on every door, back and front, so I can avoid having to buy furniture to store it in.  So my domicile always looks like a warehouse, but I don't care.  However, if you do care, then you can save space by hanging stuff on doors you don't want normally visible.  You do not have to use these hangers, merely for wreaths.  They hang lower, so you can cantilever the objects hung, and thus save space, versus the normal over-the-door hangers (of which, I must have every type, dozens of them).  So you can hang a bag of plastic bags behind a door on the lower hanger, or even a thick mouton coat (which I just hung on THIS hanger, and it works better than the usual wreath hanger).The normal 'wreath hanger' you can find in Dollar General or other stores, is far less sturdy.  I have a bunch of them.  The hook is much shorter, and the metal much thinner.  By contrast, THIS hanger is about twice as big a hanger at the curved end, twice as thick in the metal, and still the door closes well.  Since now the trend is for white doors, it's unobtrusive, too.Bought two, gonna buy more.

"What the average person 'knows' about 'Rome' is usually restricted to wildly-inaccurate but popular movies like Gladiator, or the Bible movies like the Robe, Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, etc.  The actual life of Romans in Rome was considerably worse, and Rome itself was a swampland.  The gases must have inflated the egos of those who scrambled up its seven hills when the malaria (yes, mosquitoes) became too much late summer, for those seven hills birthed a crazy populace like nothing you can imagine:*They PRIDED themselves on not working, the reverse of their origin as a people.*They PRIDED themselves on taking what didn't belong to them, as if the success of thievery, proved them virtuous.*They PRIDED themselves on not being able to count time and years properly.*They PRIDED themselves on silly superstitions, like unlucky days, and whether a liver pointed in a 'bad' direction, or eclipses;*They PRIDED themselves on living over swampland.*They PRIDED themselves on myths so stupid, you know the people were crazy, viz, that their PROUD ROMA came from two boys suckled by a she-wolf??And how were they able to do this?  Simply because the lands they took over, each had a populus which was far nuttier!  So by comparison, the 'Roman' values were superior, and people flocked to those values.  So Rome won the peace, and Pax Romana was born just in time for Christ's arrival.  Few believed in Him, of course.  But the course of history per Bible, is that this attempt to 'Romanize' will continue, so if you're a believer in Christ, you gotta get a handle on this Rome thingy.  If not a believer, it's still a provable trend of history in your own land in your own day, which echoes in everything you do and all the media, you consume.And what you then find, is this:  We are just as crazy as them, when we laud their history.  But study it we must, because it's the same crazy set of values the world holds dear, now.  All the wars of the 19th-20th centuries, are due to someone trying to go back to those 'glory days of Rome', with Adolf Hitler in particular, monitoring Speer's attempt to reconstruct those buildings.Something about this insanity captures the human heart.  So what was it?  You can't find the WHYs in the typical tomes by the greats like Gibbon, Mommsen, Bury or Cary.  You can only find that they too were enamored.  Indeed, those chronicling Rome at the time, who were themselves Romans or Greeks nearly of the same periods, are also enamored.  So look:  Gibbon wrote in 1776 (first edition of Decline and Fall), but Tacitus wrote in the 2nd century;  the praises of Rome by Romans and others are all over the historical map, proven in stone and bone and blood as you study why oh why did these people fight, and the vanquished, get converted?  So clearly the WHYs are important.This extremely incisive book helps you see the reality Romans lived on a daily basis, and helps you understand the WHYs.  It's not attempting to do that, but instead to do what a movie intends to do, to RELATE your own life 'now' to their life 'then', so you can identify.  So, the book is simple and short, good reading on an airplane, and good to keep afterwards for epitome (summary) reference.If you can't stomach reading, then rent/buy the miniseries ROME ( free for Prime Members, http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-from-Saturn/dp/B006GLM9OM/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1422428768&sr=1-1&keywords=ROME ) .  It's an eclectic mashing of the culture, for some of the things depicted don't belong to the time period of the storyline, but even the storyline is helpful (though largely fictional) to help you grasp the culture of the day.THEN go read any of the books of better repute (CARY being the next-most-incisive author I've found,  http://www.amazon.com/History-Rome-Down-Reign-Constantine/dp/0312383959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422428930&sr=1-1&keywords=Rome+Cary but you can find earlier editions elsewhere) -- bearing in mind the cultural underpinning of daily practice you got from this Cowell book.  For here, you get the living conditions and hence the mindset.  So when you read the more scholarly tomes (though this one exhibits that quintessential scholarship of an INTEGRATED appreciation of the whole) -- when you read those other tomes, you can read them 'as if' a 'Roman', yourself.The only reason this book gets 4 stars is that it's too short, but maybe Cowell wrote a sequel.  I must check into that.  Great read, great writing style, can't put it down.I've compiled a bibliography of contemporaneous and current Roman history tomes which are all readable on the internet, which I'll put in the comments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MF6RM7WG2ALE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399503285#wasThisHelpful","R2MF6RM7WG2ALE","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been studying Roman history for maybe 30+ years.  Would never want to study it at all, if it weren't necessary, for the sake of understanding Bible.  For all the writers of Roman history both as it occurred and now, are horribly disorganized in their presentation of the facts.  For it was always the style of writing about this history, to turn the story into a commentary, presuming the reader was long familiar with those facts.  But, we aren't.  Consequently, when you try to study, you spend hours and hours just getting familiar with the geography and the three-pronged names, all of which sound alike.  No one ever fixes these problems, but instead the style of commentary continues today, in every modern historian's rehash of those facts.  Very frustrating.Enter, then, the value of this book.  Example: pages 79-84 are on the Year of the Four Emperors, aka the Long Year, and are vital to understanding, esp. if you are a Christian.  For, the Bible makes much of this Year, and it's triggered per Bible, by the death of the Apostle Paul, which occurred (per Bible, not per Christians) circa March-June, 68 AD.  Yeah, and that's when Vindex started to rebel against Nero.  From that point onward, a chain of rebellions occurs which in Bible you realize are to explain that if the Christian doesn't mature, all hell breaks loose.  To that end, in quick succession you had the books of Peter (who died after Paul), then Jude, then Mark's Gospel and then the Book of Hebrews (maybe written by Mark, definitely not by Paul).  All to explain the current events, so a believer could learn how to interpret that history, since it was long expected that the Rapture would occur by 70 AD (which Paul had hypothesized).  So the idea was that it may or MAY NOT happen, and the newly-issued Bible books in 68-69 just enumerated, would be valuable for rapid spiritual growth.  Of course, that growth did not occur, so there was a hiatus for a decade, at which point John writes to explain what happened, and would happen, as a result of the lack of growth.So knowing that period would be vital to understanding Bible, for a Christian, as a part of isagogics.  Alas, you can't get much on that period, except as commentary -- but THIS book, pages 79-84, gives you a handy explanation I've not found anywhere else, so you can quickly see the panoramic meaning.  Then, you can actually understand the contemporary writers, as well as the more modern ones like Morgan and Wellesley, who wrote specialized tomes on this Long Year (here in Amazon, just look of their names and Year of the Four Emperors).Of course, most people aren't Christian, and wouldn't have that reason for studying Roman history.  Great: you'll still find this book a vast timesaver, because again the normal practice is to write up SPQR's history as if the audience were already long familiar with it.  Because, they used to be.  100 years ago, every schoolchild had to learn Latin, Greek, Hebrew and the history of Rome.  You couldn't be graduated from high school, else.  Today, all that is gone, and so now the names so long known by children, are mysteries.  Again, enter this book to help you bridge the huge obstruction of names and places seldom explained in any of the writeups.So the larger question is, why study Roman history, if not a Christian?  Everything you do and think today, is sourced in the 1st century AD, that's why.  All countries today have constitutions and political structures which are sourced in the Roman style.  Most all the world's customs, are romanized.  And everyone has romantic notions of that time.  Which notions, are quite far from the truth, but quite close to the values the Romans themselves had:  'Romans' who were anywhere in the world, never having set foot in Rome itself.  So how can such a culture become so universal?  Well, study Roman history and you'll know.  But you'll never profitably study Roman history, without this book to save you time.  Wish I had found it, 30 years ago.The book contains many maps in great detail which frankly I've never found anywhere else.  So when you are reading Gibbon or Mommsen, two of the most respected and comprehensive historians of Rome, you can look up the places mentioned in this Atlas, and follow along.  Else, you will zone out.  Same, when reading the more modern scholars' reworking of the same data.  For the data is fragmented, has been rehashed and recollated and is constantly changing, much as for Egyptian history.  So without a grounding in the names and places, you will just give up study.  If you give up, you will not understand 'today'.  For today, is really just a tech-advanced version of that same first century AD.  Don't believe it?  Study the history, use this book alongside whatever you're reading, and then you'll know.  For past is prologue, and if you hope to make sense of 'today', you must know those 'yesterdays'.  All our wars of last century were attempts to recreate Rome, and that desire continues, unabated (but we are so tired, we're not fighting again yet).  So in the future, it will happen again.  Trend of history, to recreate 'Rome' will continue.  So if you want to get on top of that future, you need to know, this past.  This book will be vital to saving time, in learning it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZ5FWIPYJGPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871966522#wasThisHelpful","RIZ5FWIPYJGPS","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review concerns the 5 lbs., which I got outside Amazon because I didn't know it was in Amazon.  Was looking to replenish, and found it here.  But I won't buy the 5 lbs. again, as the barrel (as pictured, exactly) is a royal pain to use.  Took me 20 minutes to repackage in other containers.  VERY FRUSTRATING, Now Foods!!!Wish these came in pouches or at least in those rectangle containers for food storage (but NOT the MADware kind with the popup lid which makes stacking an accident waiting to happen).  There ARE options to buy this product in other packaging, but the prices are not good;  as usual, someone's not paying attention to the prices, for it shouldn't be more expensive per pound to buy 10 pounds, versus buying 5 (as I write).  And, the 15 lb option hangs, so I can't see its price.  Will come back later and see if the prices/product page are fixed.  Alas, suddenly there's no way to report a dysfunctional product page, to Amazon (they removed the link for reporting problems, in the 'new' and worse version of Amazon navigational programming).Now for the product itself.  FAST MIXING is indeed what you get, yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Powder is tasteless, as it's supposed to be.  I use it to make Twinlab Yeast (here in Amazon), mix better (key to mixing that yeast is to combine it with some granular powder, milk powder, or other powder, mix dry and then add liquid slowly so it won't clump).The amount of protein per scoop is also standard, though the scoop is weird, more like detergent scoops than typical whey protein scoops.  Per scoop, this brand is a bit more pricey than Body Fortress (my usual brand, but they refuse to make unflavored), BUT.. this brand mixes far better.I've mixed it with many things to mimic solid food: kale powder (Hoosier Hill, here in Amazon), cheddar or bleu cheese powder (same brand), tomato powder (Harmony House, here in Amazon), but my favorite use of it, is with McCormick's (wet) Beef Base (also here in Amazon).  Mixed, it imparts a Cremora-type taste.  It's even good if you mix with water but merely add some Rajun Cajun or Louisiana hot sauce or Sabrozita (all available here in Amazon).So this is a five-star whey protein, except for the packaging and prices, but I'm hoping someone will correct both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4GCT8X6CBVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OWAB4#wasThisHelpful","R2R4GCT8X6CBVE","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahhh, per my other review on this time period, I had wanted Morgan's book (  http://www.amazon.com/69-D-Year-Four-Emperors/dp/0195315898/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=1-1&qid=1421743073  ) turned into a movie on the Year of the Four Emperors.  If you're a Hollywood producer, DO IT PLEASE -- but use THIS book instead, for developing your screenplay.  Not sure I'd start it on Jan 1 69 as Wellesley (and Tacitus), but rather on the last few months of Nero.  Unless, you can make the flashbacks work as Wellesley tries to do in this succinct but riveting reconstruction.  Even so, read Morgan first for backstory, and to get familiar with the names, timelines, battles, etc.  Then read this, then maybe read Morgan again.For Wellesley understands the need for a 'live' story.  Morgan, provides much needed underpinning of the events.  One big flaw in all Roman history writings is that each writer takes a commentary approach, from 1st century Roman writers onward; so you're always scrambling to a dictionary or encyclopedia to just get the basic timeline and geography.  Oh well.  Next best thing, is to TURN THE STORY INTO A MOVIE.Here in Wellesley, we have a kindred drama, yet without sacrificing scholarship.  A TON OF MONEY CAN BE MADE BY DOING A MOVIE FROM THIS YEAR IN ROMAN HISTORY, NOT TO MENTION THE BILLIONS ON GAME OFFSHOOTS, SO PLEASE MAKE A MOVIE ON THIS.  If done right, it will be bigger than Game of Thrones, bigger than Gladiator.  Okay, enough caps and yelling.If you are a Christian, you desperately need to understand this year in history, because per Bible it's triggered by Paul's death maybe only days or months before Nero's, in June 68 AD.  Paul is maybe predicting his own death for that year, back in 56 AD when writing Ephesians 1:3-14 (I did videos to prove when and what Paul meant in mapping future Church history, see my 'ggs11' channel in vimeo).  For it's a vital Bible principle that as goes the believer, so goes history, and all of Roman history to Odovacer was future-traced by Paul to show that principle (again, see my videos, it's all documented live in Bible text, hundreds of videos and many Word docs you can download and vet yourself in the Greek).Of course, most of the world only wants to be entertained after coming home, plunked in front of the TV, eating dinner. Fine.  This book will entertain you, too.  At least, until someone wisens up and makes a movie out of it, hiring both Wellesley and Morgan as consultants.Will shut up now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXBJHEWEMR5UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415236207#wasThisHelpful","RXBJHEWEMR5UF","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT, 1/21/15:  I just used a pinch of this in my coffee pot to fix the burnt taste coffee gets when left 'on' for too long.  It worked right away on the mostly-full (say 8 cups) pot.  That makes this a worthy purchase even at the price listed, as plain citric acid won't correct burnt coffee flavor as well.Be very careful when you sprinkle it in.  Original (grammar-corrected) review, follows below.===========This has true lime taste only when used atop food like you'd use salt at a meal.  But it pours quickly, so be careful when shaking.  You do NOT need added salt, so if you're going to use it in or after cooking, don't salt the food while it cooks.  I love salty things yet I find this too salty; it has no sodium in it, per the ingredients' list. For me, there's no detectable lime flavor if used in cooking.  But yes, quite a nice smell.Citric acid (what makes lemons or oranges sour) is a lot cheaper, but doesn't taste the same.  This has citric acid in it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B61TJDQFZFYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Z2O0T4#wasThisHelpful","R3B61TJDQFZFYK","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use oatmeal the way other people use rice or pasta.  I mix it with grapenuts (or knockoff), about half and half.  Prefer the old-fashioned, but couldn't find it on Amazon, so got this.Try this idea when you're pressed for time, esp since this thing is 1-minute:1.  Put a frozen chicken leg on a deep-dish microwave-safe stoneware plate or (i.e., Corelle Frost White serving) bowl.2.  'Surround' it with as much of the grapenuts-and-oatmeal RAW mix as you want for your serving.3.  'Surround' it with maybe dollops of canned spinach or Progresso lentil soup, atop #2.4.  Then, season your chicken leg to taste (yes, while frozen).  If you want an idea, I like mixing ketchup and Woeber's Mustard with a few drops up to 1/4 tsp of Wright's Hickory Seasoning (sold here at a good price, in Amazon).  Then I spread it on the frozen chicken.  Or, I cover the chicken in Rajun Cajun (maybe you won't want that much spice).5.  Cover and nuke for 10 minutes.Great fast dinner.  The juices from the chicken soften both grapenuts and oatmeal just a bit, so they are like pilaf.  Faster, less mess than the 'normal' cooking prescribed, huh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RLE1YQST5MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID0PB4E#wasThisHelpful","R16RLE1YQST5MV","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 10 lbs of this coffee back last May.  It looks and tastes like your medium-roast commercial brands, but less bitter.  However, I think it's overpriced.  Back in May, they had too much left over, so it was priced comparably to the commercial brands.  However, if you can mix it half-and-half with the Italian Roast (which is a marvelous true dark roast), then you have a treat.  1/4 cup of coffee measure produces a strong brew of six 6oz cups, in a standard (i.e., Proctor-Silex or Black 'n' Decker) coffeemaker.  The Italian Roast would reduce the amount of coffee you need to get the same results, depending on how strong you like your coffee.  If instead you use Hisspresso, then you can reduce the measure even more.Have been drinking this coffee every day since May, at least a pot a day.  Flavor remains consistent, maybe because I keep the coffee sealed tight in plastic containers within the freezer (you know, the plastic containers which house Folgers or Maxwell House coffees).  It doesn't burn or taste burnt after a long time standing.Again, the claim that the coffee is Divine is either humorous marketing or chutzpah, but at the right price it really is worthwhile.  The bags are a pain, but sturdy, and the coffee always comes well-packed in boxes, so even the bags can be tolerated.  I put the five-pound (80 ounce) Vienna Roast in two 30-oz Folger's red cannisters, or Maxwell House blue ones, plus there is enough left over to fill up a 2-lb. Body Fortress Whey Protein plastic jar.  Could mix the Italian Roast in there (at least one pound per five) when transferring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1176FYWW5IRBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVQ453Y#wasThisHelpful","R1176FYWW5IRBV","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"EDIT: this EDIT concerns the special features on the Ultimate Edition, which I just got.  (The original review is about the movie itself, below.)  The casing for the DVD set is very annoying, worse than normal DVDs when you try to remove each DVD without scratching it.  DVD quality is just like the movie shown publicly, or a tad crisper.  Nice to watch it, uncut.  Nice to be able to select scenes and rewatch, versus VHS.The Ultimate DVD edition (not blu-ray) has the following 'Bonus features' on Disc 1:  Production Notes -- which is merely one screen -- Cast and Filmmakers, DVD Newsletter, Recommendations, DVD-ROM Features.  These are extensive, designed to explain the backdrop of the movie.  The 'Cast and Filmmakers' section is not live, but rather little screen explanations about the cast, stuff you can learn better in imdb.  The DVD newsletter is a waste of time, as is Recommendations, other DVDs  you might want to purchase (Scent of a Woman and 12 Monkeys) as a result of liking Meet Joe Black.  The DVD-ROM features supposedly only play in your computer, but I've never had any luck activating those features in Win7, so if you have XP, maybe they will work, maybe not.  The screen says you need Win95 or higher.  I didn't try it on my Win98 machines.  So the Disc 1 features are pretty much useless on a DVD player.Disc 2, by contrast, has the original movie which Meet Joe Black updates:  'Death Takes a Holiday', starring (a very young) Frederick March.  It's in black and white, very 1930's, Alberto Casella's play put to film.  You don't get any choice of scenes, it just plays when you click on it.  Rather silly movie start, so Meet Joe Black is much more interesting.  Even so, the only way you can get the Death Takes a Holiday, is to buy this DVD pair.  But the older movie is well-made, technically.  Plot is quite different, of course.  Charming, in its own way.  In that older film, Death assumes the body of a living person, having made the deal with the Duke of the household, the night of the Prince's arrival.  Very theatrical, kinda hokey really.But the 'Spotlight on Location' is a live interview with Mr. Brest, the Director.  Very interesting.  So Disc 2 has these two 'features' which are worth the purchase.OH, for all you Greek drama addicts, you'll notice the 'yes' refrain that runs pan-movie, much like John's Gospel (in Greek) uses oude, ouden, outhen to signify 'no other' (thus proving inter alia, that YES the pericope adulterae is valid, right it sits in John 8 that begins and ends with a stoning) -- so this movie, uses 'Yes'.  Cute.  So nice, when real literary talent is incorporated into a movie script!Original review, follows below.  First paragraph was updated, to tie to the above text.=============The myth of Hades and Persephone is the underlying premise for Meet Joe Black, apparently keying off a line in the original film where the bride-to-be isn't quite ready to become a bride.  The wistfulness of Persephone, see.I can't watch it often enough.  Originally got it on VHS years ago, gonna get it on DVD, trying to decide which version.  Looks like I'll get the Ultimate US DVD set?  Of all the 20 formats you can buy here on Amazon, that one seems to have the most features, plus the original 'Death Takes a Holiday' on which this movie is peripherally based.  But the real origin, is in Greek mythology, Hades and Persephone.  Go read that first, and you'll get much more out of this A+++++ movie.Perfectly done in every respect, best film editing and camera work I can recall seeing in a film (okay, maybe Pearl Harbor and uncut Das Boot are as good).  Seriously.  If you pay really close attention upon repeated viewing, you'll notice the full-circle development of the characters, too (even the bit parts).  Death and Parrish reverse roles, by the end.  You got the puns, right (perish=Parrish=parish=par ish, given that 'ish' is Hebrew for 'man', and 'par' means 'by' in most languages)?Truly a work of art, this film.  Nice touch, that they don't take sides about which afterlife definition you should believe, but only that there is one.  Yeah, because that's the question of your life: what comes 'next'?  Gotta know that, to orient to 'now'.  Best of all, you realize that a superior being wouldn't necessarily despise you, and you wouldn't necessarily be intimidated by it/him/her.  So the 'sting' of regarding an afterlife (which people tend to religify, as if 'god' had to be a religious person) -- is removed.  Whew.For this, is a film you LIVE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOKL6FFH4IBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DJVXHA#wasThisHelpful","RCOKL6FFH4IBJ","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, since even Christian and Jewish Bible scholars NEVER get the facts straight, the movie's many inaccuracies can be forgiven.  Of course, when God tells a story (or if you don't believe in God, consider it just a fairy tale) -- you are expected to draw conclusions about what is not said, from what IS said.  All good literature requires the reader's mind interact with the text, and Bible is no exception.So what's great about this movie, besides the acting, is that the makers are trying to fill in what's not said in 1Kings Chapter 1-5, where the first part of the movie is told.  Yes, Adonijah (=""My Lord is God"") rebels.  It's a seven-year hiatus, with 1Chronicles 22-end explaining why:  David was not exactly gung ho to appoint Solomon, arguing the latter was 'young and inexperienced', during David's seven years of retirement when he designed all the Temple stuff and the priestly courses, service, etc. at God's bidding.  David is between age 70-77 when this happens, dying at age 77.  This latter fact, the scholars never get right, because they don't READ 1 Kings 1-5 to understand the clear chronology.  They read Josephus instead, who was seemingly unable to get even one date right!  So of course the 'contradiction' isn't blamed on the errant Josephus, but on Bible. What is a movie producer, to do?So the movie doesn't cover David's age, nor does it resolve the scholar errors in the Temple building chronology (for they misread Bible there, too).  Yet in Bible's timeline, David's age is critical to the whole: for the DEADLINE OF THE WORLD'S TIME, established in Moses' Psalm 90 chronology meter (in Hebrew, can't see it in English), was for Messiah to die 1000 years after David dies, and the outer limit of that time is traced by EVERY Bible book writer ANNUALLY.  Every Bible date 'hubs' to it;  because, the 'Jubilee' of the Millennium (Psalm 90:4) was SCHEDULED to begin 57 years after Messiah's death (sum of Passover and Pentecost in the Mosaic law was the reminder of that).  So once you know that, ALL the Bible's dates not only become clear, but you can prove them historically.  Since scholars make this 7 year mistake on David, therefore, all Bible dates 'seem' problemmatic, and have been debated, for centuries.  But it's the scholars who are wrong.  So it took me 10 whopping years to plot Genesis through Revelation dates to show what BIBLE says;  so anyone can vet Bible accuracy WITHIN Bible.  The numbers all balance perfectly, much as your bank balance must when you properly account all your transactions.  Thus you know you've got a right BIBLE interpretation.  (You can find that demonstration of Bible material balancing the dates, under 'brainout' in vimeo, or 'brainouty' in Youtube.)  For Israel was ordered to COUNTDOWN TO MESSIAH beginning in Genesis 5, which is why Bible seems so boring.  Why, people make movies, to work out what they don't understand.  As, here.Seems the movie tries to rectify the 1Kings scholar error, in the long speech repeated from 1Kings 1 between Max Von Sydow (playing David) and Ben Cross (playing Solomon), about 40 minutes into the movie (which is playing on my TV while I write this review).  That's laudable.  It tries to flesh out the hot political story of Solomon and his rivals.So a major flaw in the movie, is that SOLOMON HAD ALREADY BEEN CROWNED KING THE FIRST TIME but then David's support waned, so he got sick (as God commanded Solomon be enthroned, but David's bucking God); and thus Adonijah, started to gain support.  The crowning at Gihon is the SECOND crowning of Solomon, per Bible (ibid).  Else, the movie valiantly tries to interpret 1Kings 1-5, with great acting by all.However, after Solomon's second crowning, the movie increasingly departs from Scripture (i.e., alleging Nathan didn't marry, when BIBLE clearly states that Joseph and Mary descended from Nathan, for God promised they would NOT descend from Jeconiah son of Solomon), and (beginning two hours into the movie), goes instead to the many gossip books written about Solomon's alleged relationship with Sheba. Bible proves those gossips wrong, in the books Solomon wrote.  He wrote Song of Solomon about a common Shulamite woman, who he loved and lost; that book parallels world history, hence is a parallel spiritual lesson (i.e., God is your true love, don't 'marry' so many others and miss Him).Duh: no Queen would ever have a son out of wedlock and then go home.  In fact, scholars for the longest time couldn't even prove there WAS a Land of Sheba.  I forget when, but I think it was during the 19th or early 20th century that they finally found archeological evidence of that kingdom?Point is, from the Sheba story onward, the movie's all gossip.  Hence 3 stars, not five, because when someone claims to tell a BIBLE story, then the BIBLE ought to be consulted, not gossip.  Whether you believe the Bible is good or right or not, if you claim to talk ABOUT it, then READ it, k?  If I was making claims about YOU, whether you were good or not, shouldn't I consult YOU?  See: basic common sense and morality is violated if I go to gossips but NOT to you, and then claim what THEY say true, but what YOU say is ignored...Of course, no movie or documentary of the Bible ever made, but consults gossip, contradicting Bible with no compunction or morality, whether made by Christians, Jews, or anyone else.  Oh well.  Better to try and fail, than not to try?And yeah, the acting is wonderful, which is not normal for Bible movies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R324FRA34CK031/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW8JPEQ#wasThisHelpful","R324FRA34CK031","A2LEIANN1UZTHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LEIANN1UZTHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review covers Macademia and the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor.  You get the box you see, which has 10 bars in it, wrapped in pairs.  The bars are small.  Pros are the portability, but the con is major: the bar crumbles as you eat it.  So you need to stand over a plate or sink to eat.The Macademia white chocolate is extremely sweet, so if you prefer that much sweetness, you'll like it.  Also, the Choco Peanut, which rather resembles Cocoa Krispies.  Not very chocolate-y, and I couldn't taste the peanut butter at all.  I put them in the freezer, hoping that they will become chewy and less crumbly.So the upshot is this: if you're into VERY sweet, you'll like these.

The plastic is warped around the metal portion of the toaster so it doesn't run straight along the toaster, which makes it look even cheaper. The buttons and knob are so incredibly cheap looking. This toaster isn't worth 45.00 dollars. It works, it toasts, but it doesn't toast well. It is cool looking on the counter, but that's about it. I wish it was better made because it is really cool looking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DTKY8I0VJ9C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGCKZNE#wasThisHelpful","R3DTKY8I0VJ9C8","A3OC93X866Z8TB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC93X866Z8TB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This says refurbished, but mine looked like a brand new, never been used, humidifier.  It is large, but that also means that it holds a lot of water.  Mine didn't come with instructions, at all, not even a little sheet.  That is incredibly frustrating.  I was able to figure it out without them.  You pull the large gallon tank off of the unit, and there is a large cap that screws on.  Remove the cap, and fill the tank with water.  I didn't fill it completely, because I really don't need to run it today.  I only filled it to less then 1/4 full.  It works, even with that amount of water in it.You have low, medium and high.  Low barely does anything, high emits a substantial amount, and so does medium.  You can choose warm mist, however, I didn't notice any temperature difference at all when I switched this on.  So, that being said, the mist isn't hot, it is actually cool, which is good if you have children or pets.The entire thing lights up when you turn on the light, and it is a really pretty, relaxing blue.  You can put it on a timer to turn itself off after 4, 8 or 12 hours.  The dial on top allows you to point the mist wherever you want, and you can split it so you can point it into 2 different directions.I really like it!  I wish the warm mist was warm, but I still like it.  I love that the mist is a fine mist, and the humidifier is incredibly quiet.  I can't even tell that it is on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73Y0AVX7L46J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQN6BX2#wasThisHelpful","R73Y0AVX7L46J","A3OC93X866Z8TB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC93X866Z8TB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This large sized freezer bag is perfect for slices of pizza that you might want to store in the fridge.  That is what I use them for the most.

"So far, this little water bowl works well.  My cat prefers the circulating type over the fountain type, because she doesn't like the water splashing on her face.  Because this bowl circulates the water, your water stays fresher longer.  There is a charcoal filter that the water runs through.Cats tend to drink less water then they need, and it is hard on their kidneys.  Kidney disease is the number one killer of cats.  My previous cat passed away from it at 15 years old.  Cats are able to concentrate their urine and store it in their kidneys for long periods of time.  This is what damages the kidneys.  When they drink more water, it keeps their kidneys flushed out.  It is best if you can get a cat to drink more water.  I let my current cat drink water out of the sink, or wherever she wants, as long as she is drinking.  It is also best to feed them wet food, because they get the water from the food.  I give her a mix of wet and dry, so she gets the best of both worlds.Fountains and drinking bowls like this tend to entice cats and make them curious.  They will drink out of bowls like this more often then they will out of a standing water bowl. If you are looking for a good bowl, this one is working really well so far. Mine hums, but not horribly loud.  I have it in the kitchen, so I can't hear it very well in the rest of the house.  The purple is a pretty color!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38TNCSRDMKV7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151JV6IY#wasThisHelpful","R38TNCSRDMKV7U","A3OC93X866Z8TB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC93X866Z8TB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cat lingered a bit over the bowl, and then she dug in.  She likes this food, and the ingredients are really good ingredients.  I always look for grain free, because it is much better for their system.  My previous cat was fed Purina cat food all of her life, and she ended up with some really bad IBD issues in the last couple years of her life.  After researching, I discovered that her low quality food could have contributed to it.  I feed my current cat, and higher quality food now.  I also feed her wet and dry.  Feeding dry only is also bad for the cats system.This food is processed in Pennsylvania, but it doesn't say it is made in the US.  If it was, it would proudly display that.  They get their ingredients from somewhere else, and it doesn't say where.  That being said, it is up to you to decide if that matters.This is good food, and my cat seems to really enjoy it.

"I was looking for a lamp that I can use for cutting out iron-on appliques that I sell.  I need one with great lighting.  This one is perfect!  It has a very bright setting, and I love that I can change the light intensity from white to a more yellow, natural light.  I also LOVE that I can extend the arm of this light towards me, while I am sitting on the couch.  With my old desk lamp that sits on the coffee table, I had to lean way over and underneath it in order to see what I was cutting.  That makes for some sore neck issues most of the time.  This lamp will remedy that!The USB port in the back is great for charging my phone, and having it nearby in case I need to use it.  I also love how I can fold this lamp flat when I am done using it.  Since I have it on my coffee table, it takes up less space when I am not using it.  The top of the arm that holds the light gets warm, and so does the plug, while it is in use.  Not hot, but warm.  This isn't a big deal, as you can still easily grab it.I love this light!  I absolutely love that you can move it around to where you need it.  I also love the brightness and adjust-ability of the color.

"I have always been a fan of Charmin, and this toilet paper is no exception.  It is a strong one-ply, basic toilet paper.  It lets off very little lint, in fact, it may not let off any.  It is easy to roll and it doesn't tear upon pulling.  I like this because people use less toilet paper when they come visit.  I have to use about 3 more squares than I do with a thicker TP, but, it is still less because these rolls are loaded, and those 3 squares equal about 1 of the Quilted Northern Ultra Strong that I compared it to.  As a habit, people tend to roll out a certain length of toilet paper regardless of the brand, kind or thickness.  There is less waste with this paper.I really like it.

"I received this for free, in exchange for an honest review.  I always write honest reviews because I appreciate it when others do the same.This little gadget is great if you have a power outage, or you need some light while camping.  You can charge it by plugging it into a charger in the wall, or you can hand crank it.  It lets off a lot of light.  You can either expand it, or leave it closed.  By expanding it, you create the lantern which radiates more light.  If you leave it closed, it can be used as a quick flashlight.I wish it had something to hang it with.  The crank doesn't work, and there isn't anything that you can use to hook it onto something.  It has to set on a surface.  That isn't a big deal, but it would be nice, if you were camping, to hang this from something in your tent.It's really bright, and it has 2 settings where one is brighter then the other.

"The recipes in this book are written well and easy to follow.  They are normal recipes, that you can make with normal ingredients.  All you need is a Spiralizer, which you can get right here on good ol Amazon!  I think this book is great in terms of the assortment of recipes provided.  I obviously haven't made all of them, but the 2 that I have made, were easy to make.2 things I don't like, and 1 of them is a big one for me, is the fact that there is no nutritional information on any of the recipes.  Most books now tell you how many calories, fat, protein, etc, are in each recipe.  This book is completely missing that.  Because of that, I am giving it 4 stars.  I almost gave it 3, but the recipes look really great. I just wish they would have put the nutritional information in here.  That was a huge disappointment when I opened this book.  Not all recipes in this book are low calorie, in fact, many of them are made with butter and high calorie ingredients.I also don't like that there aren't photos of the finished product.  They wouldn't have to be color photos, even a black and white can show a person what the meal is going to look like.If the above things don't bug you, then get this book!

"Oh wow, I love this speaker!!!!  Seriously, this thing is awesome.  The sound is fantastic, and I love the fact that I can save presets.  The app is super easy to use and navigate.  I didn't need instructions to set this up.  It was so easy, I had to wonder if I missed something.There is a quick start instruction sheet that comes with it. That is all I needed.  I plugged it in, downloaded the app, it recognized it, and I was ready to go.  I LOVE that this version has Bluetooth.  I can play my Sirius radio on here, and it sounds awesome!  Not only that, but it tells me what it playing, on the screen, even for Sirius radio.  It tells me the station and the song.  The older versions weren't Bluetooth compatible, so if you are debating on which version to purchase, that might be your deciding factor.The volume range is huge.  I only have it turned up half way, and it is loud.  I live in an apartment, so I can't turn it up any louder than that.The remote has everything you need for the station you are listening to.  It is a basic remote with volume buttons, the skip buttons, off and on, the presets and the thumbs up or down button.  You can use Pandora and IHeart radio, as they are built into the app.  I was hoping it had TuneIn, but it doesn't.  It has local radio stations, but it doesn't have all of them in my area.  It is missing one that I frequently listen to.In order to set up the stations, you have to use the app on your phone.  If you want to listen to stations that you don't have saved, you will need to use the app.I was able to easily download the software onto my computer, to access my ITunes music.  I have Windows Vista, and it downloaded within a few minutes.  I couldn't believe it, but all of my songs and playlists were there in seconds.  It is perhaps the easiest and fastest software I have ever downloaded for a device like this.This speaker is awesome!  I love it!

"I seriously love this device!  My cat loves the laser and she responds easily to my voice.  The picture is very clear, if there is light in the room.  I placed mine on an end table, so I can get a closer view of her.  I turn it on, turn on the sound, start calling her name, and she comes running.I have been playing with my cat, every hour or so, since I hooked it up yesterday.  I have showed my co-workers, and we have all gotten some good laughs at her chasing the laser and staring intently at the camera.  She knows my voice, but she can't figure out why it is coming out of this box.The laser has a lag on it, and it doesn't run smoothly.  That is a bit annoying, but it doesn't bother my cat, so I don't care.  I do wish that it moved better and that it actually stopped where you touched.  The dot on the screen is actually not where the dot is on the camera.  Again, my cat could care less so it truly isn't a big deal.The sound is really sensitive.  If you are in a room of people, and anyone is talking, it picks up everything.  The sound is loud, and there is also a lag.  It would be nice if you could adjust it so it wasn't quite so sensitive to everything it picks up.  Not a big deal, because again, my cat could care less.  It is all about the cat, you know!  In this case, with this device, it is.My hook up process was flawless.  I was up and going in about 3 minutes.  The app leads you through how to hook it up.  I have an iPhone 5S.Sometimes the video becomes pixelated and freezes.  One time, the laser didn't work.  I pressed the back button, opened it back up, and everything was fine again.It doesn't come with instructions.  You have the ability to let your family access it and play with your cat, if you want.  You can also set certain friends up.  I personally don't want anyone signing into a camera that I have in my home, without me knowing, so I didn't turn these features on.  You also have a ""wall"" that when you take a still shot, it gets posted there.  I don't like this feature, because I didn't know what it was.  I posted a still shot to Facebook, but it automatically posted to my Petcube wall, and all of a sudden I had people that I didn't know, liking and commenting on my photos.  Since there aren't any instructions, I didn't know about this.  Also, a couple people started following me.  I didn't authorize this.  I wish that you had the option to either agree or turn off this feature.You can view others cameras (if they are set up as public), and play with the animals.  There are several Humane Society type places that have set their cameras up as public.  Last night, I was playing with a cat that is in a shelter.  The cat was running around chasing the laser that I was moving, and having a great time.  I thought that this was REALLY cool.If I could make changes to this device, I would add the ability to record video, the ability to turn off the public wall and following option, and I would include instructions that covers the app.  The app was somewhat cumbersome to figure out, especially without instructions.Other then that, this camera is awesome!  Seriously, what a great idea!  My cat loves it, and I love playing with her during the day, while I am at work.  My cat is high energy, and sometimes has play aggression towards me when I get home from work. My vet suggested that I find something that she can play with during the day while I am away, so she isn't so aggressive at night.  This is perfect!!!  I can wake her up periodically during the day and engage her.  I am not a fan of long reviews, but there are so many cool things about this camera, that I had to share all of them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXOQBLMMUKPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWN8O8#wasThisHelpful","R2RXOQBLMMUKPV","A3OC93X866Z8TB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC93X866Z8TB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That being said, it can also make them slippery, so be careful.  Your feet will slip around on slippery soled sandals.

"My cat loves this food.  She loves 4 of the different flavors of the Nutro dry cat food.  This is a favored brand of hers.  I can't lose when I pick one out.  She dives right into her bowl and devours every morsel.  The pieces are larger, which I like because it makes her chew them which makes her slow down her eating.  Grain free is my preferred feeding method for her.  Grain free is a better choice for cats.  I had a cat that got IBD as she aged, most likely because I fed her cheap Purina dry food.

"Your local drive-in theater is closing, and you and your 20-ish buddies decide to go to the last show, but one of you has to “sneak in” by riding in the trunk.  It is rather expected, after all.  And what’s the worst that can happen?  You get caught, and maybe have to pay for an extra ticket.  Except that this drive-in is located in Promise Falls, and in that bizarre little town, pretty much anything can happen.  Although nobody could have dreamt that the screen would blow up and fall onto the parked cars.  Was it a tragic mistake, or is there a mysterious serial killer at work?“Far From True” is about Barclay’s fifth book either based in Promise Falls, or featuring characters who found later their way to Promise Falls.  You needn’t have read all of them, but you absolutely *must* read “Broken Promise” first, or you’ll be totally lost.  “Broken Promise” was a pretty complete book, but with a cliff-hanger ending, and this book picks up where that one left off, just days later.  You get a couple of new characters in a milieu that was packed too full already, but the herd thins out quickly enough.  And again, there is an awful lot happening all at once, far more than you’d expect for the size of the place.  Some things are related, some aren’t … or are they?If you can keep all the players sorted out, you’re in for a fast-moving, suspenseful adventure.  Just about the time you think you know what’s going on, there’s a new (and probably disturbing) wrinkle that forces you to re-think everything.  Characters are all well-fleshed out, each being more, or sometimes less, than they seem.  Absolutely nothing is predictable, but while some things seem a bit far-fetched, nothing is unbelievable.  Barclay has a very light and wry sense of humour, that sneaks in when you least expect it.  It’s a “sticky book” because once it’s in your hand, it’s awfully hard to put down.Aside from being overly complex, my main complaint is this book ends in yet another cliff-hanger.  Is this the second in a trilogy, or will there be an endless series of cliff-hangers to come?  I really don’t want to wait a year for the next installment, only to find that I’m being strung along yet again.If you read and enjoyed “Broken Promise”, you’ll almost certainly want to read this also.  If you’ve never read Barclay, start there, and then decide whether to try this book next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32FD2CGUF9B7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472705#wasThisHelpful","R32FD2CGUF9B7K","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before giving my impressions of this filter, I’d first like to decode the product description.  First, “XS-Pro” means this is a very slim filter, though it still has threads so you can screw another filter onto it.  “Kaesemann” is a filter manufactured by the Kaesemann company, now owned by B+W.  They are designed to be more resistant to damage from humidity.  “Circular” is a special type of polarizer, distinguished from “linear”; circular is the type you need to use on DSLRs.  “Multi-Resistant Nano Coating” provides a layer of protection against dust and water.I installed this filter on my Nikon 50mm lens and headed outside.  Note the standard lens cap fits over the filter just fine.  For landscape photography, it’s easy to use – on a clear, sunny day, just frame up your shot, then turn the outer ring until the blue of the sky darkens.  Turn another 90 degrees, and the effect disappears.  This doesn’t mean you should just leave it on all the time, because a polarizing filter costs you 1-2 stops.  The filter is also useful for removing light reflections, either through windows or water.  Just remember to *always* turn the outer ring as if you were screwing the filter onto your lens, otherwise you may accidentally unscrew the filter and drop it.Overall, this worked exactly as I would expect.  In my landscape shots, the blue sky darkened appreciably, and fall foliage colours became more distinct.  I’ve included sample photos to show the difference.  Because it was so bright out, I didn’t miss the stop of light at all.  This is a very high quality optic, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a polarizing filter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OSN9O76C493/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PH4V9CM#wasThisHelpful","R20OSN9O76C493","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not immediately familiar with the name William E Butterworth III, but with some digging, I found that is the nom de plume of WEB Griffin.  I’ve read many of Griffin’s war novels, and on the whole, they are tightly crafted, well-written stories.  I was eager to see how he would handle a humorous romance novel.  After I got this book though, the writing style seemed awfully familiar, and not at all like Griffin.  After some digging, I discovered that Butterworth co-authored the MASH novels with Richard Hooker.  Well, not the original novel, rightly lauded as a satirical masterpiece, but he ghost-wrote the follow-on books like “M*A*S*H Goes to New Orleans”.  (Note this series is conspicuously *NOT* listed with the author’s other works inside the front cover.)  Unlike the original MASH, these are less tight, less focused, less satirical, less sophisticated, less mature, and track more along the lines of fraternity pranks and bathroom humour.  “Hunting Trip” reads like a continuation of that series.Butterworth makes it clear in an Author’s Note that this is not an autobiography, but a romance novel.  Perhaps not, but it parallels his wiki biography fairly closely, though blown up larger than life.  As for romance, there’s precious little to be found.  Lots of damaged adults rutting, musing on past rutting, or planning fiendishly to rut, but light on any romance.It’s also very dialogue-bound.  There is an awful lot of talking, but very little happening.  A lot of the talking is very repetitive and grows quickly annoying.  Most conversations are liberally sprinkled with “EXPLETIVE DELETED!!”  I’m not euphemizing here, he repeats those two capitalized words ad nauseum.  Character names are used for laughs in a juvenile fashion, with appearances from such illuminaries as Chauncey S. “Steel” Hymen, Bobby “Fender” Bender (auto mechanic), … it’s too tiresome to continue.  How many times do you suppose you would read the full title of “Lieutenant Colonel William ‘Don’t Call Me Bill’ O’Reilly” before the appellation got cut down to LtCol O’Reilly?  Well, at least 20, and it never does get shortened.Then there is a jarring disconnect with reality.  People and things appear decades before the actually did.  For example, our protagonist is flown from Germany to the U.S. in a C-130 in 1947; this aircraft didn’t enter service until the 1950s.  Poetic license is one thing, particularly with humour, but downright ridiculous is quite another.The book does have its moments, and gets funny in spots.  Overall though, unless you really miss those “M*A*S*H Goes To …” books, you may not like this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHD29EQEGJE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176233#wasThisHelpful","R3MHD29EQEGJE1","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas and Ciaran Devine have been released from juvenile prison.  Ciaran, the younger and seemingly more innocent of the two, confessed to the savage killing of his foster father, David Rolston.  He insisted that he had to, claiming that Rolston was sexually abusing his brother.  Thomas, the more visibly hard-edged of the two, had been jailed as an accomplice, and has kept clean since his release.  The two, as close as brothers possibly can be, are back together again, and really bad things are starting to happen.Feeling a bit melancholy yet?  The book is just warming up.  The entire cast has serious “issues”, whether physical, emotional, relationship-wise, or all of the above.  The detective who worked the case has a strange attraction to Ciaran.  The probation officer, newly and bitterly estranged, wants absolutely no part of the mess.  Rolston’s son has never gotten over the killings, and the shame he feels it has brought to his family, and would like nothing better than a measure of vengeance.  Here, Belfast is presented as a cheerless, dismal place, where hope has long since departed and happiness would be an unwelcome stranger.Make no mistake, this is a superbly crafted, well-paced crime drama.

"After a 9-year hiatus, Du Brul’s iconic hero Philip Mercer returns for his 8th novel.  A mining engineer by trade, Mercer would seem to be an unlikely action figure, but he has a knack for being in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and then getting out of a jam using his wits and fists in equal portion.  Here, Mercer’s mentor and virtual stepfather is killed deep in a mine where Mercer has been working, and he arrives in time to watch the killers escape.  Can he jet across the globe, find them, and get the vengeance he needs?Even before he started writing together, Du Brul’s writing style was eerily similar to Clive Cussler’s.  Mercer and Dirk Pitt are not only cut from the same cloth, they are basically twins separated at birth.  This book reinforces the similarity of their styles, where the first chapter starts by fictionalizing Amelia Earhart’s fatal flight, then weaving that in with Mercer’s adventure.  This is the precise mechanism used in every Pitt story.  On the plus side, he avoids Cussler’s deus ex machina system of solving intractable situations by using variations of the word “miraculously”, or having Mercer drag himself across hostile landscapes with near-fatal injuries.Mercer’s comic foil, Harry White, was conspicuously absent in the first 7 chapters, and I was hoping this meant he had passed quietly away.  Sadly not; he figures less prominently than before, but he’s still an unnecessary distraction.  There’s funny, and then there’s obnoxious, and Harry falls out on the wrong side of that comparison.Call it a guilty pleasure, but it’s a fun read, even if it is a variation on the theme of the other books in the series.  If you haven’t read the rest of the series, no worries, you can pick this up as a stand-alone novel and not feel lost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLJZ2EXLK68H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385527756#wasThisHelpful","ROLJZ2EXLK68H","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I occasionally like to sit out on the front porch and watch the world go by.  Unfortunately, the local mosquitos also like it when we do, and descend to grab a quick meal.  Rather than dousing ourselves with fly dope, we simply pull a fan from the garage and aim at the bench we’re using, which does a pretty good job of keeping the little buggers away.  This is an assessment of the Lakewood fan in that role.Turn it on “high”, and it’s *loud* -- like listening to a Cessna doing an engine run-up.  From 4’ away, normal conversation is simply not possible.  Curiously, turning it down to medium doesn’t change the airflow very much, but drops the decibels considerably, and makes the fan tolerable.  Also in terms of noise, the unit produces a very loud, annoying vibration sound.  If you push in on both grills, it goes away.  I tightened all the screws – some were pretty loose – but the noise stayed.  Then I stuffed some packing foam in between the grills and the body, and the noise disappeared.  It’s an easy fix, but one I shouldn’t have had to perform.The fan includes a set of wheels, which come in handy since the unit is a bit hefty.  There are two handles on top which you can use to carry it, or pull it along.  It’s a nice design feature, particularly if you’re moving this frequently.We had been using a Lasko 2265QM 20-Inch floor fan, which works pretty well and delivers a nice, soothing sound.  The Lakewood is noticeably noisier, and is less soothing to the ears, but moves a lot more air.  While the Lasko keeps most of the mosquitos away, the Lakewood is even more effective, at least until dusk.Overall this is a very good fan, and if it weren’t for the vibration problem, would have gotten 5-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BK7PY3KBSOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8Q30RS#wasThisHelpful","R31BK7PY3KBSOZ","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pro: This spreader works as advertised.  It puts down a nice even layer of whatever you load into the hopper.  Contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, when you set the control lever to “OFF”, nothing leaks out.Cons: The unit ships in two pieces, the handle and the hopper.  However, the instructions say: “This unit is completely assembled.”  That wouldn’t be a problem, since the only assembly involves attaching the handle to the hopper with two carriage bolts and wing nuts.  There was a bag containing the carriage bolts, a steel fitting, 3 phillips-head screws, and a very bent Allen screw.  But no wing nuts.  Hmmm.  I called customer service, and after a long wait, told the representative my problem.  She asked for the model number, which she insisted would be on the body or front page of the instructions.  It isn’t.  She asked me to e-mail her a picture of the unit, and said she would call me right back.  That was 2 weeks ago, and I haven’t gotten a call, e-mail, or the wing nuts.  I went to the local hardware store and bought some that fit, but I shouldn’t have had to.  I still don’t know what the extra pieces are for.There is another problem.  You can see from the picture at the top of the Amazon page that this unit sits back at a steep angle.  Well, it sits back so steeply that it will topple over at the lightest touch.  You have to brace this against a wall or chair while you fill the hopper, or it will tilt back and spill everything.  (Yes, I found this out the hard way.)Overall, with some care, this will work.  But the extra/missing/damaged parts, flaky instructions, nonexistent customer service, and poor balance convinced me to avoid ever buying anything else from this company.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LT07JIR90C6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTKMBF6#wasThisHelpful","R2LT07JIR90C6C","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You’ll never meet Peter Caswell.  Not just because he’s fictional, but because he lives in the not-terribly-distant future.  Consider yourself lucky on that, because he tends to kill most people he meets.  He doesn’t remember any of that though, since he has an implant that erases his memory after every mission.  This allows him to be a very effective spy, able to kill with a clear conscience and no baggage afterwards.  He’s a pretty happy fellow, at least until his latest mission, which takes him to a near-clone of earth, where he has to kill a fellow Earther who’s trying to introduce modern – and lethal – technology to that world’s mid-20th century society.  But he picks up an unexpected ally in Melni, citizen in one of the world’s two factions, and then a very unexpected change in his mission.There are some old and new sci-fi concepts to be found here, but the central idea is well thought-out.  There are lots of novels about parallel worlds, but this puts an original and clever spin on the concept.  We get lots of detail about some nifty gadgets, as well as the locations, and the characters are very deftly handled and realistically fleshed-out.  The editor compares this to a James Bond novel, but that doesn’t quite hold up.  When things are moving here, the action is indeed fast and entertaining.  But a good part of the middle of the book just bogs down.  There are pages upon pages of Melni being conflicted about what to do, whom to help, and what ultimate ideal to support.  Of the 570+ pages, at least 150 should have been cut.  Yes, it’s important to understand the characters’ motivations, but a sci-fi/action book shouldn’t drag this much.So, this won’t be the best sci-fi novel of the year, but it’s still awfully good, and we’ve clearly not heard the last of Mr. Caswell.  Hopefully, the follow-on novel(s) will get some tighter editing and better pacing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I3VWRBNNKPQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391267#wasThisHelpful","R2I3VWRBNNKPQ6","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you’re cutting plywood, you need a good way to guide the saw for straight cuts.  If you’re working in a shop, you can buy a table that’s purpose built for the job.  For DIYers, you’ll most often see a circular saw riding along a straight-edge guide.  People with deep pockets and a passion for precision can get a Festool track saw.  Bora offers another choice, the WTX saw plate.  You mount your circular saw to the plate, and then place the plate on top of a straight-edge guide.  You can use a Bora guide (not included) or virtually any other guide, because the plate is adjustable.  I thought this would be handy to use with my cordless saw on smaller outdoor projects, so I tried it out.First, you adjust the rail mount so it fits your guide precisely.  You secure it with two large Phillips head screws.  The downside of being so adaptable is, you’ll have it either too tight or too loose.  You want it snug, so the blade doesn’t drift while cutting, but too tight and it won’t move, or you’ll have to force the saw.  Next, you mount your saw to the plate.  There are two plastic clamps in front with slotted screws.  One of my slots was extremely narrow, making it almost impossible to tighten with the tiny screwdriver I had to use.  I found that you *must* align these clamps very carefully or they will pop out when you tighten them.  At this point, consider just how you’re going to ensure the blade is parallel to the edge of the jig.  You could cinch the blade up against the jig, but then you’re going to chew up the jig as soon as you turn the saw on.  You can set a thin, flat spacer in there if you have one, but it must be uniform thickness or the blade won’t be parallel.  Remember to remove the spacer before using the saw.  Now attach the back clamp.  Notice that the plastic front clamps bend upwards when tightened, and the back metal clamp bends down.  The plate is plastic and flexible, so when the back clamp was tight, it had distorted the plate and pulled the saw off of vertical.  This is where I started worrying about just how safe or useful this tool would be.Next, I clamped my straight-edge guide to a piece of plywood.  Here comes a slight problem – take a look at the product photo, and note where the straight-edge fits in.  The blade sits 5” from the left side of your straight edge.  That means you’re not going to be cutting down any small pieces with this jig.  I went for a tight fit and found the saw hard to push, but still found the cut to be imprecise.  I’ve cut down hundreds of pieces of plywood over the years using various guides, and I’ve never felt as uncomfortable or unsafe as I did using this product.  Not recommended.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGA1PHAE93JR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBGCXFA#wasThisHelpful","RGA1PHAE93JR2","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you own a drill press, you have probably built a jig to hold things down while you’re drilling them.  This vise is intended to replace your jig with a sturdier, more precise, and easy to use system.  Let’s head to the shop and try it out.First, note that this includes only the jig, but no instructions or mounting hardware.  You will need at least two t-bolts and knobs (star or t-knob) to hold this to your drill press – it’s inexcusable that they weren’t included.  If you don’t some laying around, figure another $5-10 for those parts, or buy an assortment pack since you’ll end up using them for other jigs eventually.Since there are no instructions, I went to the Bora web site for some mounting inspiration.  They show the jig mounted so the handle points away from the press (towards your torso as you operate the press).  I wanted to mount this on my Delta 12” tabletop drill press.  Unfortunately, the slots on this jig are 5 ” long, and 4 7/8” OC apart.  The slots on the Delta are 6 3/8” OC apart – uh oh.  I was able to rotate the jig 90º and use two t-knobs to hold it down.  Next I grabbed a dowel, which is the hardest thing to hold properly with most home-built jigs.  You can manually unscrew the vise to open it, or there is a button on top (not explained – no directions, remember?) that you can push to pull the vise apart.  It doesn’t work smoothly, and you usually have to “finesse” it to pull it out or push it in.  Also, the plastic handle pulls out and rotates down, so you can get extra leverage to tighten your work piece.  That doesn’t help when you’re trying to push the button and pull the vise apart.Having passed those hurdles, this jig now comes into its own.  You can tighten the dowel very securely without marring it, and move the jig until it’s centered precisely where you want it.  Once the jig is tightened down, it’s rock-solid, and you can leave it in place for repetitive drilling.Overall, this is well built, very solid and sturdy once mounted, very precise, and pretty easy to use.  If you own a drill press, this is well worth having.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GWGTPS568D4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5XU07A#wasThisHelpful","R1GWGTPS568D4U","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s 1950, and America is still healing from WWII.  Despite the horrors of that war, there are still plenty of young men willing to serve in the military, even as the Cold War gains momentum.  One of them, Jesse Brown, coming up from the very humblest of circumstances, gets a commission and becomes the first black Naval aviator.  Assigned to the carrier U.S.S. Leyte, he soon finds himself in the middle of the Korean War, supporting the Marines by flying Corsairs left over from the ‘40s.  His tour is nearly over, and he’s preparing to return home to his family, when he’s shot down over enemy territory.  His wingman, Tom Hudner, can do nothing but circle overhead and watch Jesse struggle to escape from the cockpit as smoke pours out of the engine.  Unless he breaks the rules and takes an incredible risk.Don’t for one second think this is some dry history book, or stale war story.  This is a very carefully researched, and exquisitely crafted tale, which reads like a blockbuster novel.  Jesse and his squadron mates have to struggle with a dangerous new war, as well as cope with race relations in completely uncharted waters.  Events, places, and even conversations are laid out in lavish detail, but the pace never drags.  There are photos so you can get better acquainted with the players and aircraft, and plenty of maps so you can stay oriented.  Korea may have been the forgotten war, but you’ll never forget this story.If you can reach the end of this book without a tear in your eye and fierce sense of pride for the stars you’ll meet inside, well, you are one very cold customer.

"So, you’re David Harwood, and life hasn’t been treating you kindly of late.  Your wife is dead, and you quit your job with a major Boston newspaper to return home to sleepy little Promise Falls.  But on your first day back at the local newspaper, they go out of business and you’re stuck living at home with your aging parents and young son.  You have a cousin in town who recently lost her baby, and decided to head to the hospital to grab a handy replacement.  Fortunately, her mother runs the hospital, and quietly managed to sweep that little incident under the rug.  One day you head over to your cousin’s place to drop off some food, and find her there with a baby in hand, which she says was dropped off by an angel; and, there appears to be blood on the door.  What a day to be an out-of-work journalist!I have read three of Barclay’s other books and loved them.  They all have the right mix of edginess and suspense, an eclectic group of characters, and a compelling premise.  Here though, he tries to incorporate too much craziness into one small town.  Besides the murder and kidnap central to the story, we have a group of dead squirrels, a group of mannequins riding a mothballed Ferris Wheel, a rapist on the loose at the local college, and an assortment of other minor oddities, any or all of which may or may not be related.  Some things are never explained, such as what happened to David’s wife, though it’s left sounding like something bizarre and tragic.  And although many things are cleared up at the end, some are left dangling, in a fashion that suggests a follow-on novel.This isn’t a bad book, there are just too many pounds of “stuff” in the 5-pound bag, and things bog down amidst all the distractions.  If you’re already a Barclay fan, you’ll probably want to buy it.

"Ben Sawyer is a cop with some problems.  His anger management issues got him fired from the Oakland (California) PD, and left him to retreat to his native Newburg (Wisconsin) to work for his father-in-law, who is the Chief of Police there.  Being a “keep it all bottled inside” kind of guy is causing increasingly serious issues with his wife, Alex, who has taken to hanging out in Newburg’s new coffee & book shop.  Which shop is coincidentally run by an attractive single guy who has rather caught her fancy.  One night, Ben and Alex get rousted out of bed, and Alex is arrested for murdering her supposed lover at the shop.  Will Ben give his wife the benefit of the doubt, and gamble his own freedom and the future of their son to find the truth?Like Ben, this book does have a few problems.  The premise is a bit far-fetched, which can ruin a book even in the hands of a competent author.  Fortunately, Griffin is a very gifted author, who can balance a lot of places and characters and cross-purpose motivations while spinning a compelling and addictive tale.  In fact, the characters are the real highlight here, exquisitely drawn and full of both freckles and warts.  You’ll have to get past one fellow who is so racist and misogynistic he’ll leave you feeling queasy, but then again, it’s not hard to find people like that running loose.  As for the main bad guy, well, he’ll leave you cringing as he hacks a bloody path across the landscape.So, get past the premise, brace yourself on the edge of your seat, and enjoy the read.

"Mary Grant has some serious problems.  Her youngest daughter has cancer.  Her other, older daughter is suffering teen angst in the form of rebellious nerdicism.  Her husband, an FBI agent, has just been shot and killed while working with an informant out in the lonely wilds of the Texas prairie.  But she’s not buying the FBI’s official version of the story – basically, “your husband died because he was stupid” – and she’s determined to find the truth.  Her investigation is about to make her problems a whole lot worse.At the core, there could be an interesting story here.  Ian Prince, one of the world’s richest men, is taking over the supercomputer industry and selling his very best to U.S. intelligence agencies, with back doors installed at no extra charge.  Since he also owns one of the largest telecommunications corporations, he’s able to tap into any data on anybody, and any corporate secret, and any foreign intelligence, whenever he wants.  He can of course also manipulate anyone’s finances on a whim.  Being your typical 1-percenter, he naturally has no qualms about ruining or killing everyone who gets in his way.  He does have a soft spot for widows and orphans though, not that it slows him down much.  He plans to live forever, and has built his huge empire for the single purpose of tracking down his long missing father.  And it’s all going swimmingly until Mary starts asking some indelicate questions and her daughter starts probing into Ian’s software.  What it boils down to, here, is Suzie Homemaker and the Katzenhacker Kid take on the evil, omniscient, omnipotent, billionaire.  If you can swallow that one, you’re going to enjoy this book.Christopher Reich is a superb author, and I love some of his other books.  The writing here is good but the plot is implausible and Ian’s motivation is just plain silly.

"A level-headed scientist at The Lux, an elite think-tank, begins to show signs of distress and strange behaviour.  One day he comes completely unhinged, injuring his assistant and getting himself locked into a library by security for his own protection.  Bent on destruction, he manages to kill himself in a thoroughly horrific way.  Enter Jeremy Logan, the world’s only enigmalogist, and an alumni who was invited to leave the Lux some years before.This is the fourth in the Logan series, which lives in the shadow of the Agent Pendergast series that Child writes along with Douglas Preston.  I don’t think it’s quite on the same level, but it doesn’t miss by much.  Child is an exquisite writer who doesn’t describe a scene so much as paint it, and then brings it fully to life along with his characters.  The Lux, an old and slightly creaky mansion, takes on a disturbingly eerie aura.  It’s supposedly haunted, and you’re left to wonder if it really is, or if there’s another explanation for the strange events that continue to unfold.  Nothing is predictable, and you’re kept perched on the edge of your seat for the entire ride.  The book starts out at Loch Ness, where Logan was hired to debunk the Nessie theory, and provides an enchantingly entertaining take on that enduring old myth.You can read this without having read the other Logan entries, but it’s really better to start at the beginning.  That said, this is easily the best entry in the series, and highly recommended.  My only criticism is that I read Child’s books much faster than he writes them, and I really wish he’d crank up the production just a tad!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXHXSIK2NYQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531400#wasThisHelpful","RVXHXSIK2NYQJ","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ray Bowman, who survived “Sting of the Drone”, and has quietly retired to the Virgin Islands to start a new and less violent life, returns in “Pinnacle Event”.  A nuke explodes in the Indian Ocean, and it’s soon evident that it was only one of six that recently went missing from South Africa.  The President is concerned that they are headed to the U.S., probably to influence the upcoming elections, and wants Bowman to track them down.  Reluctantly, Bowman begins a whirlwind world tour to discover who has the nukes, and what they plan to do with them.I really enjoyed Clarke’s first book, but this entry falls short.  The premise suffers first from a pretty far-fetched group of bad guys with a rather outlandish motive.  Second, any time you claim there’s only one person who can possibly save the world, and fail to make an awesomely convincing case as to why, things start to come apart.  Sure, Bowman  is presented as a smart and knowledgeable guy, but he’s no James Bond.  The writing here is very jerky, to the point that several times I had to back up a few pages and try to figure out what was going on.  For example, Bowman is introduced as sorta/kinda living with two women who were in a relationship, and having a baby with one of them.  If you’re going to drop something that bizarre into the reader’s lap, then you need to make it a part of the storyline, or at least explain things.Overall the story was interesting, but unlike “Sting”, not at all plausible.  And Bowman is not nearly a compelling enough character to base a series on.  Call it a disappointing second book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L9985Y8LHV5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047986#wasThisHelpful","R2L9985Y8LHV5X","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is no shortage of books about aliens visiting Earth.  Or invading our planet.  There are even a number of tales of Earth ships blundering their way into the middle of an intergalactic war.  But suppose – just suppose – that two advanced civilizations invaded Earth simultaneously.  They’re not interested in our resources, or our technology, and view humans with the bored disinterest you might give a bug you find on your lawn.  They’re fighting over, and destroying, Earth because we lie smack dab on the border between their civilizations.  And there’s very little chance anyone will survive, until a very strange boy becomes an unexpected game changer.McCammon takes that premise and runs with it to pretty good effect.  We start out in the middle of a firefight, with the boy running for his life, and we learn bits and pieces of the backstory while things are happening very quickly indeed.  Character development is on the sparse side, which is fine because everyone and everything is vulnerable to sudden destruction.  Nifty technology and scary aliens push onto center stage instead, and the author paces things almost perfectly to keep that perspective working.There are a few problems though.  The readability level at the beginning seems to be around 8th grade level or so, and I thought this might be intended for young adults.  But there is one longish chapter in the middle that’s as graphically sexual as it is unnecessary for the story.  The author could have made his point with a lot less crudity.  The writing too seems a bit uneven, with the dialogue occasionally strained.  These things don’t ruin the novel, but they do bring the enjoyment level down a notch.Overall, there’s some clever ideas and good writing here.  It’s a pretty good book, but a sharper editor’s pen could have made it into a great book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIW53D3P5QWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596067039#wasThisHelpful","RWIW53D3P5QWN","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A deadly epidemic is getting underway.  A new bacteria can enter from the smallest cut, and very quickly spread while turning your insides into mush.  Of course, there is no cure.  This bacteria is no accident: it was created and released by a shadowy group that wants to blackmail the U.S. government.  Lou Welcome, recovering alcoholic and surgeon, has to race to find a cure before his best friend dies a horrific death.Lots of promise there, right?  Too bad the book never delivers; instead, the story circles round and round like a one-oared rowboat.  Rather than Lou’s friend having a simple accident that lands him into the hospital, pages and pages are spent setting up and dealing with a nasty accident.  Characters pop in and out with no purpose.  There’s also a lot of verbiage devoted to Lou’s second job, but it does nothing to advance the story.Then, there are the bad guys, a very nasty conservative group called 100 Neighbors.  They believe that America’s social welfare programs are destroying the country, and are determined to eliminate every form of entitlement.  They are quite happy to have millions die in the process, and even happier to murder assorted good guys and random strangers as well.  In case you are a little slow catching on to the fact that conservatives are nasty, evil people, there’s a quote from the group’s founder at the start of every chapter to remind you.  The author even takes time to paint fundamentalist Christians as child-beaters.Common sense – nowhere to be found.  As bad things start to happen, Lou is brought in for questioning by the FBI, and decides, beyond all reason, not to say a word.  Later, Lou and his FBI friend decide to go Rambo and take out the bad guys, but don’t tell anybody to avoid tipping them off.  Mind you, if they don’t survive, nobody else has a clue about the Neighbor’s location or identities, so they would win by default.  The bad guys have tons of money, which is pretty much a tautology, but lack the sense to put any sort of electronic sensors outside of their headquarters.  They are probably so busy thinking up evil deeds that they can’t hear the gunshots and C4 explosions in their front yard.There are cardboard characters, comic book bad guys, and clunky writing.  If you slog through to the end, you are rewarded by a couple of chapters that are just plain silly.  Avoid like the plague.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P7S46POD7EKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030927#wasThisHelpful","R2P7S46POD7EKA","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buffalo had a serial killer who specialized in kidnapping and hanging teenage girls.  The police only captured him after a failed suicide attempt, and after years in prison, he is showing signs of recovering from the self-inflicted brain injury.  Somehow, he manages to escape while being moved to a different facility, and returns to Buffalo to continue his killing spree.“Hangman” has a certain eerie vibe, which leaves you feeling distinctly uncomfortable as you read.  Anyone who has children can instantly relate to the sense of terror a city would feel with a child stalker on the loose.  The author does an excellent job of building and refining this mood as Abbie, the lead detective on the case, scrambles to find the killer before he can hang his latest victim.  It’s very suspenseful, and some judiciously laid red herrings keep you nicely off-balance.While the plot was superb, the characters seemed a bit off.  Abbie isn’t fully fleshed out, although that may have been done in the first book of this series.  Other characters, like her boyfriend, pop in and then out with no real purpose or definition.  And there is a very odd plot hole.  The Hangman is being moved in a van by a corrections officer and a guard.  The guard tells the officer to get out and buy some oil, so he guard can have some time alone with the prisoner.  The guard is killed and Hangman escapes, but the officer never re-appears in the story.  He clearly would be the first person the police would look for, either as a victim or accomplice, but somehow he’s completely forgotten.That aside, this book definitely succeeds as a clever, dark, edge-of-your-seat thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZAINGI0TWHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345538080#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZAINGI0TWHK","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’re a pro athlete, it’s a good thing to be thinking about a second career.  Because no matter how good you are, or how good the pay is, your body will only last just so long.  Johnny Adcock, a pitcher, has been practicing his for a while.  He helps out other players who need some discreet investigating done.  When one of the catchers on his team asks for help tracking the source of a newly surfaced explicit video his wife made years before, it seems like a pretty routine request.  It turns out to be anything but.“The Setup Man” starts with an intriguing premise and fleshes it out pretty nicely.  Johnny – who still needs to concentrate on his day job – is drawn in to the world of pornography and prostitution, and quickly finds his life on the line.  He’s no Sherlock Holmes, but does a fascinating job of tying together clues.  He’s also very believable in most of his actions, reactions, and insights.The problem is the plot itself seems too ambitious and far-flung.  The original investigation gets “super-sized” and loses credibility.  There are also some odd scenarios which don’t make sense.  A very laid-back friend kills a man, and Johnny just shrugs it off.  They decide to get rid of the body, and Johnny insists on dumping it at a church rectory.  Why he did this is never explained, and you’re left scratching your head.Overall, it’s a decent read, and includes some interesting insights into MLB.  Note there are some very graphical sexual depictions, so this is definitely not for young readers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRHNIVL2DLLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538456#wasThisHelpful","RRHNIVL2DLLT","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Watney is having a bad day.  He’s part of the third manned mission to Mars, but while outside on an EVA, a large windstorm hits.  It’s so brisk that it tears the satellite dish off its mount, which impales Mark.  He’s last seen blowing away, and his suit telemetry confirms that he’s dead.  The rest of the crew has no chance to search for him, because the wind is getting ready to topple their ship, so they have to blast off immediately.  Thing is though, Mark isn’t really dead . . .This book starts with a great and original idea, but in the world of sci-fi, that’s no guarantee of success.  Weir takes the idea, fleshes it out, breathes life into it, then lashes a rocket engine to the pace and lights the darn thing.  It’s fascinating, spellbinding, and nearly heart-stopping, while staying completely realistic and believable.  The challenges and roadblocks Weir invents are as diabolically evil as Watney’s solutions are ingenious.  He no sooner solves one life-threatening problem and something completely unexpected pops up.  But he’s far from perfect, as his own mistakes and oversights nearly kill him more than once.  Fortunately he has total confidence in himself, and a wickedly twisted sense of humour to keep himself company.  If you’re familiar with Stoker Ace (from the book “Stand On It”, not the movie), you’ll have some idea of what to expect.There’s a lot of science in this sci-fi, but it’s not just for techno-geeks.  There’s a surprising amount of authentically handled human drama and emotion on display as well.  As news of Watney’s survival spreads, he becomes the media darling of the century.  Many authors would have let this spin out of control, but it’s tightly contained here and very deftly handled.If watching someone overcome near-impossible adversity gives you a nice warm-fuzzy glow, you’re going to love this book.  It is simply superb on every level.  Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31N4UO9TWJ9CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139024#wasThisHelpful","R31N4UO9TWJ9CB","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having a great new idea can be a dangerous thing.  In fact, in the world of “Influx”, it could cost you your life.  That’s because the Bureau of Technology Control is worried that too much innovation can be disruptive for the teeming masses, so when a major invention is close to being introduced, the inventors are seemingly killed but actually spirited away to the BTC headquarters.  There, they can “join the team” and continue their work, while helping suppress other technology, or sent away to undergo some not-so gentle persuasion.  Jon Grady is getting a little too close to controlling gravity, so he’s snatched by BTC.  But he won’t play along, so he’s locked up with a robotic minder that will stop at nothing to change Jon’s mind, including snatching little pieces of it away from him.This sci-fi thriller is as inventive as it is engrossing.  There’s a lot of technology explained which you don’t really need to understand, but once the story gathers steam things really fly along.  It’s very realistic and entirely believable, with Jon transforming from an ordinary scientist into a very gritty hero.  The one weak spot is the bad guys, who slip a little too close to parodying themselves.As with any good sci-fi story, there’s a message tucked away inside.  Here, we’re exposed to the dangers of unlimited power and the accompanying hubris, and how ordinary people can come to see themselves as being superior to their peers.  The end result of an accelerating nanny state is horrible to behold, as the BTC gradually embraces the philosophy of “we had to destroy the village in order to save it.”The overall tone is dark but there are little bits of humour sprinkled in, just to keep you off-balance.  At 400 pages it’s an amazingly fast read.  Mark this as a solid success in both the sci-fi and thriller genres.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SC2GDG69XNCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953183#wasThisHelpful","R1SC2GDG69XNCR","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ballistic missile sub USS Kentucky is heading out on a routine patrol.  But they’ve barely left Hawaii when they receive and authenticate an order to launch all 24 missiles at Iran.  Unknown to them, the order wasn’t valid, and some clever espionage prevents them from receiving the launch termination orders.  The President and his National Security Advisor decide that destroying the sub before it reaches launch range is the only way to prevent the deaths of millions, and send the entire Pacific fleet to sink the Kentucky.The good news is the story is pretty well plotted, and the pacing is kept brisk.  The main players are well drawn and act the way you would expect, and the dialogue is well handled.  The author does a wonderful job of grabbing your attention and keeping it.But, the book does have some quirks.  People in the midst of a nuclear crisis find themselves distracted by stray romantic notions.  There are some “by the most remarkable coincidence” relationships.  The guy in charge of figuring out how to destroy the Kentucky just happens to have a son serving aboard.  The NSA just so happens to have an ex-husband who is a major player in the story.  And inexplicably, the Secretary of Defense plays absolutely no role in any of this.Finally, there are some plot holes big enough to launch a Trident missile through.  Fast attack subs are sent to find and contact Kentucky, and know they’re very close.  They can’t reliably track it with their passive sonar, so they just give up.  Why not use active sonar?  Why not use the WQC underwater telephone that appears later in the book?  The Kentucky approaches, and identifies, a large group of U.S. Navy ships in their path.  This puzzles them, and they decide it must be an exercise.  An exercise – days after Washington gets nuked?  Another attack sub gets close, but has a reactor accident, leaving only partial power.  Rather than launch torpedoes and risk being destroyed in a counterattack, they turn around and sail home.  That sounds extraordinarily timid for a fast attack captain.  There’s more, but this should give you a fair idea.Flaws aside, the book was a fun read and pretty absorbing.  The author is working on a sequel, and I liked this one enough that I’m looking forward to reading the next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD8TBM1MARBRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250039010#wasThisHelpful","RD8TBM1MARBRN","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve read Eisler’s previous books, you’ll know that John Rain is a half-American, half-Japanese, ex-Special Forces Viet Nam veteran, and a paid assassin.  This is the eighth in the series, and if you haven’t read any of the others, don’t worry, you won’t be lost.  Here, you’ll learn how Rain, fresh out of the Army, grew from being a lowly CIA bagman into a highly effective assassin.  It’s anything but a smooth journey, as he learns valuable lessons only by repeatedly cheating death.  But this is much more than a standard action thriller.  Rain struggles with his conscience as the body count mounts, and has to make conscious decisions about whether it’s worth killing again.  And there is a surprisingly tender love story that’s skillfully interwoven so that it’s an integral part of the main plot, rather than a stuck-on afterthought.As always, everything is very detailed but the pacing never suffers.  Not only is the story amazing, but 1970s Tokyo is brought fully and convincingly to life.  People, places, motives, sights and sounds: everything is realistic and believable.Things do get a bit graphic at times, so this is not appropriate for younger readers.  Other than that, I can recommend this book highly for old and new Eisler fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IJ7BOI4VA30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477818162#wasThisHelpful","R17IJ7BOI4VA30","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eric is an ordinary guy, who gets a call from a kidnapper demanding $1M in ransom to have his daughter returned.  And of course, he’s told not to call the police.  The only thing is, Eric is single and has no children.  Geez, what to do, eh?  He should call the police, since the kidnapper obviously has the wrong number.  But no, instead he calls his private detective buddy Jack, who recently left the police force under an unexplained cloud.  Clever lads that they are, they have Eric keep taking the kidnapper’s calls, pretending to be the right person, while Jack spends his days eating donuts and talking to his girlfriend, who is also a cop but hasn’t been thrown off the force yet.  After much muddling, they determine who the victim is, and contact the father, who is “Canada’s Donald Trump”.  He swallows Jack’s story without a shred of evidence, and serves as a sympathetic character while the muddling continues, and the police are left out of the loop.Sadly, this book has absolutely nothing going for it.  The narrative is awkward and embarrassingly insipid, but the dialogue is downright stilted and clunky.  The hapless characters are stuck dancing to the tune of an awful premise, making bad decisions, and overall, acting in ways wildly inappropriate for people who are supposed to be vaguely intelligent.  Most of Jack’s time is spent making mooneyes at his girlfriend, or thinking about his girlfriend, rather than trying to track down the missing girl.  The book is a tedious slog through utterly pointless minutiae, which is as mindless as it is meaningless to the story.  Pages are spent needlessly detailing ordering and picking up Chinese food.  Even more pages are devoted to ordering, consuming, and critiquing donuts and coffee.Although set in Vancouver, the location isn’t even mentioned until Chapter 5, and only once thereafter.  There is absolutely no local colour; it could as well have been set in Seattle, or Phoenix, or outer Timbuktu.  The infrequently encountered Canadian terms should have been explained on the off chance the book would ever cross the southern border.  For instance, most American’s won’t know that “Timmies” refers to Tim Horton’s, a superb purveyor of coffee and donuts and sort of a second home for many Canadians.Towards the end, Jack is sent to California to get the one thing the kidnapper, who is now in police custody, demands in order to release the missing girl.  He gets back late at night, and is told the station is closed and come back in the morning.  Presumably, with donuts and coffee.  If that makes sense to you, by all means, give this book a try.  Personally, I think the McKenzie brothers could have solved the case in half the time and been a couple of 2-4s to the good by page 90.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TC4DZF7NLH19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477815589#wasThisHelpful","R3TC4DZF7NLH19","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think of a restaurant.  A nice restaurant.  Probably the nicest and most expensive place you’ve ever been, serving you the best meal you’ve ever eaten.  That’s where Michael Gibney is going to take you for a “day in the life” as a sous chef.  What he describes isn’t a single, real place; it’s a conglomerate of kitchens and people, representative of places he’s worked.  As the opening sous chef, he covers everything from preparation for an exceptionally busy Friday night service – complete with VIPs from the press – and concludes with preparations for Saturday’s brunch.  He details what’s required from each person, includes some of their personality quirks, and covers what they did, how they did it, and how they interact.Sound boring?  Anything but!  It’s not simply fascinating, it’s absolutely riveting; this book sticks to your hand like a first-rate thriller.  You get an intense exposure to the pressures of preparing meals in a very fast-paced environment, where perfection is not a goal but the minimum standard.  Some personalities work well together, some clash; some cooks rise to the challenge, while others crumple.  Gibney takes us out for drinks after service, and explains via character conversations what motivates someone to embrace such a high-stress profession.One minor flaw is the random conversations conducted in Spanish.  It interrupts your reading flow and leaves you stumbling over unintelligible passages.  It would have been better to simply put everything into English, or at least include the translations parenthetically.  On the other hand, while he uses a lot of cooking terms, there’s a superb listing of “Selected Kitchen Terminology” at the end of the book which explains everything.If you’re a cook, or aspire to be one, or simply want to understand what happens behind the curtain in an upscale restaurant, you’ll certainly enjoy this book (and learn a lot too).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQN1A12Y8WLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804177872#wasThisHelpful","RJQN1A12Y8WLG","A2PLSZ90SNG3FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLSZ90SNG3FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Start with an original and slightly wacky idea: an organization known as HR Inc. is actually an assassination bureau.  They specialize in higher end targets, using agents who have literally been brought up from the gutter, trained, and if they survive, are placed as corporate interns to get close to their targets.  John Lago is HR's premiere agent, and because he's getting a bit long in the tooth to pose as an intern for much longer, he's been given his final job.  That's it; just one more hit, and he can retire in comfort.  Just a walk in the park ...Of course, it's not that easy, and John tells his story through an instructive handbook for new interns.  And what a story!  It's wildly imaginative and strangely believable.  In flashbacks, John relates several of his old jobs to help illustrate the ""Rules"" of interning.  Each is intricately crafted, brilliantly told, and most display a thoroughly wicked sense of deepest darkest humour.  You'll find yourself torn between laughing out loud and cringing in horror.I won't say any more about the story, it's really best if you walk into it like getting onto a roller coaster blindfolded.  It's only January so it's easy to say this is the best book I've read all year, but I have a feeling it will hang on to the title for quite a while.

"This book contains some good recipes for fruit and vegetable smoothies. I prefer to juice but mostly the recipes would work just as well for juicing as blending so that is no problem.Some health information is included, and it wasn't so good. For example, the book claims that carrots have vitamin A, but they don't. Beta carotene can be converted to vitamin A in the body, but it is not vitamin A and this conversion doesn't work very well in the body for some people. That is a common myth and not such a big deal, but what really bugged me were comments like where the book said insomnia has only three causes and they each can be fixed by having a watermelon and apple drink. Actually no, of course there are far far more than three causes and some involve foods other than fruit and vegetables and there is also often far more to insomnia than dietary changes. Such silly comments are unhelpful to those with real health issues to say the least.The book also includes recipes with terrible ingredients such as caramel sauce, non-fat vanilla yogurt and ice cream. Not sure what these are doing in a book which presents itself as a health book.

It is like reading someone explain why the earth is flat.The analysis is so poorly done and silly there is no point taking the time to refute any of the claims made in it. (You can easily see the facts explained in any of the books listed below.)Fortunately many others have done a far better job summing up Linus Pauling's Orthomolecular work and advocacy.Dr T. Levy's new book Primal Panacea explains that some of the most common myths about vitamin C include:1. There are no studies on vitamin C2. There is no proof that vitamin C works3. Vitamin C is not safe4. Vitamin C causes kidney stones5. Our need for vitamin C is met by diet6. Vitamin C just makes expensive urine7. If vitamin C really worked we would all be using itAside from Levy's great book there are also:* Ascorbate: The Science of Vitamin C by Dr Hickey and Dr Roberts,* VITAMIN C: The Real Story by Steve Hickey, PhD and Andrew Saul,* Orthomolecular Medicine For Everyone: Megavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physicians by Abram Hoffer,* Fire your doctor! : how to be independently healthy by Andrew W. Saul* The healing factor: Vitamin C against disease by Irwin Stone* How to live longer and feel better by Linus Pauling...and many others.Despite what this book states, in fact Linus Pauling 'the man' will be remembered by many of us.That includes so many of us who have seen for ourselves the huge impact ascorbic acid at a correct dose and Orthomolecular medicine generally have had on our health. Standing up to what is popular and politically correct but unscientific is not easy, as we admire Pauling for his pioneering spirit, guts and determination as well as his intelligence. We really need more people like him in the medical field.Just had to add a few C quotes to the end of the review:'Man's body was designed to function best with high blood and cellular levels of vitamin C - synthesised as needed by the liver. Due to an inborn error of metabolism, the vast majority of us no longer have the ability to make it, but that does not lessen our need for vitamin C or the benefits derived form it.' Dr Levy""Modern medicine's narrow approach, to treat every disease as if it were a drug deficiency, has resulted in a steep price for humanity. It is obvious millions have died prematurely since vitamin C was first discovered over 80 years ago. Brave and resolute men and women, Albert Szent-Györgyi, Irwin Stone, Linus Pauling, Ewan Cameron, Emil Ginter, Matthias Rath, Andrew Saul, Tom Levy, Steve Hickey, Raxit Jariwalla, John T. Ely, Hilary Roberts, and others promoted the idea of vitamin C therapy but were readily dismissed, even belittled."" Bill Sardi'I could also spend millions to prove that the small amounts of these nutrients will not prevent car acci­dents. Who is funding all these silly stud­ies? No orthomolecular physician ever claimed that giving 200 IU of vitamin E and 500 mg of C cured anything.Perhaps you should write a paper with tongue in cheek in which you announce, ""An­tibiotics Do Not Cure Infection"". Then, report somewhere hidden in the paper that you only gave them 200 or even 20,000 IU of a drug that requires doses of one million or more. Such report­ing is a superb example of the cynical, expensive and sleazy research so loved by Big Pharma. This is because it delays the real introduction of good medicine, in the same way that tobacco companies denied smoking causes cancer and we supposedly needed more and more and more research to prove anything.All this allows the companies to add millions of dollars to their coffers. Their defense is delay, delay and delay. The only objective of Big Pharma is to make money, lots and lots of it. How dare we try to prevent them from doing so?'

"This book was far more about positive thinking, affirmations and promoting Christianity than gratitude. Not the same at all and so just not what I was after.(Especially as I just finished reading the book 'The Antidote' as I read this one, which talked about how counter-productive positive affirmations are, and why positive thinking is disempowering to people and not very helpful!)The affirmations here are also all seemingly aimed at quite well off and healthy people. Very simplistic.

"A solid meditation introduction and simple instructions on how to get started with different types of meditation such as mindfulness meditation, meditation focusing on the breath, loving kindness meditation, mantra meditation and more. It is a good absolute beginners guide.The only part that was just not for me was the mantras given in the book as examples. I'm not at all a fan of mantras which sound like positive affirmations. I dislike this sort of forced and to me, fake feeling, optimism. (Especially after just finishing reading the book 'The Antidote' which talked about how counter-productive positive affirmations are!) I'd have much preferred some more suble affirmations listed, and also some that were not in English. But that is just a personal preference. I also don't think meditating is going to get me any more money, despite what the book subtitle is. Nor will it cure all health issues, though of course it can have some positive effect.I found this book useful, well-written and well-edited and would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HW29L56UTKVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPL30JY#wasThisHelpful","R3HW29L56UTKVC","A2C7VMN9UAYYDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C7VMN9UAYYDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world needs more books with talking cats in them. It just does.It also definitely needs more books in where the people who talk to the cats end up 'cattifying' their speech a little bit and even occasionally using some cat terminology and (very non-rude) swear words! More exclamations of cat-specific moods than swear words I should say. These are some of the funniest parts of the book.(I wont post a spolier here by sharing any of the specific words though!)The cats are also not too human-acting which I like, and still display very cat-like tendencies to try and order people around to suit them and make sure their food needs are met before anything else is done. They hang around doing their own cat things a lot of the time, as cats are always wont to do.I like too that the book touches on issues of corporate greed and how it can (and does) corrupt science.I could probably have done with a little more information about the feline mystery that forms the topic of the next book. Just a few more teasers, I guess. But perhaps it all being almost a total mystery until you start reading book 2 is the point.This is a well-written, well-paced and interesting book suitable for young kids who like cats or just animals in general. A solid start to a series. I'll definitely be saving my copy for my niece/s and nephew/s for when they get a bit older.[Important disclaimer: I was asked to provide an honest review of this book by an activism colleague of mine, whose partner is the author. This was because I am fond of writing (almost all non-fiction) reviews and because I am a big feline fan and an avid fiction reader. I read a free Kindle copy of this book, but that was due to it being free for a short period of time on Amazon as a promotion, and not a special deal made to me personally in exchange for a review. I wouldn't have written a review for the book if not asked to as a favour as I almost never review non-fiction due to time constraints, but the statements in this review are all my own opinions.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R265RG79A9ZN24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ85XJ2#wasThisHelpful","R265RG79A9ZN24","A2C7VMN9UAYYDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C7VMN9UAYYDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book contains a few excellent new tweaks to the basic Dr Rogers program for her regular readers, and also a lot of specific information about reversing diabetes.There is a lot of useful information here about supplements and which types and amounts and brands to take, the importance of nutrients as well as why many common diabetes drugs not only don't work but will make you sicker even quicker. The dangers of statin drugs and aspirin are also explained at length.Hands down the best book of Dr Sherry Rogers' to start with however is Detoxify or Die.This book is excellent. It is also very easy to read and understand. It talks about the importance of treating the causes of disease and the most important chemicals to avoid in food and in cleaning and personal care products, the impact of each of the major chemical types on the body, tests which can be used to determine your toxic load (as well as your nutrients levels and how well your detoxification pathways are functioning etc.), the problems with many common prescribed drugs, the benefits of a daily detox cocktail, the benefits of juicing and enemas, the benefits and safety of regular FIR sauna use, how to use the sauna safely and what to expect when doing a sauna program, and so much more.Dr Sherry Rogers explains that with treating the causes of disease, 'A life sentence to medications that block physiologic pathways is avoided.' She continues,`Bear in mind that since medications do not fix anything, they allow the underlying problem to continue uncorrected and actually accelerate. Meanwhile, new symptoms and new seemingly unrelated diseases are the inevitable consequence of this biochemical faux pas. Furthermore, drug side effects are the leading cause of death. NSAIDs as an example of only one group of medications, are fatally toxic to thousands of people each year by damaging joints, lungs, kidneys, eyes, hearts, and intestines. And they are covered by insurance.You and your doctor have been screwed into believing every symptom is a deficiency of some drug or surgery. You've been led to believe you have no control, when in truth you're the one who must take control. Unfortunately, the modus operandi in medicine is to find a drug to turn off the damaged part that is producing symptoms. A simple example is the prescription of calcium channel blockers, the number one drug used by cardiologists for angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia. But as with any drug, this does not fix anything that is broken. It merely poisons normal physiological pathways, thereby forcing the chemistry in a direction that attenuates symptoms.It should not come as a shock that this type of information is ignored, since studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association document how the practice guidelines for American medicine are made by physicians who receive compensation from the drug industry. (Choudhry, JAMA 2002; 287: 612-617). In addition so is the FDA, the very government regulatory body that approves drugs, riddled with advisers with financial ties to (and is heavily lobbied by) the very drug industry that is seeking its approval. And as the New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of the American Medical Association warm, even the hired clinical investigators for new drugs may have their price. 'In short, to get well you need to:A. Get the good stuff in. Give your body the fuel and tools it needs to work at an optimum level. Good food, nutrients and all the proper vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Make sure you aren't deficient in any of the major nutrients as the different nutrients all work together.B. Get the bad stuff out. Make sure your body can detoxify out all the toxic substances and toxic by-products of bodily processes properly. Stop as many toxins from getting in in the first place, and do a detoxification program to get rid of the ones you have. Stop doing or eating the things which cause inflammation and have a pro-oxidant effect, and so on.Once you've read Detoxify or Die you can go on from there and build on what you know with some of her other books. Is easier to take it all in if you start with a book that explains all the basics first. After reading a couple of Dr Rogers' books, you may also then like to subscribe to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter, to stay up to date with new developments - if your budget allows for this. These books etc. will be helpful no matter what disease label you have, or even if you don't yet have a correct diagnosis.This new book was good. Lots of people would have lots of different opinions but for me what would have made it even better would be:a. More information on healing reactions and the need to start very slow with each treatment especially if you are very ill. Far more information for the very weak and ill would be so welcome. Listing those treatments which it is extra important to go VERY slowly with due to the massive healing reactions they can cause such as vitamin C, RALA and Silymarin would also be very welcome.b. Some real discussion of the massive problems high carb diets can cause, and the fact that the diet recommended (which I could in no way follow, or recommend) would make many of us very ill and fat and weak as we can't cope with even a 40% carb diet, let alone 70% or more, and also do poorly eating grains and legumes. Many also need a ton more fat than a measly 10% to be healthy and such a low fat diet could be disastrous for their health.(I recommend the healing approach of Dr Rogers overall but not in any way her recommendation for the Ornish or Macrobiotics diets. This book has no useful dietary information at all really for those who do poorly on macrobiotic diets aside form a bit of good information on avoiding dangerous trans fats etc. Wonderful diet books which explain that a high fat, moderate protein and low but not super-low carb suits our genes and is so healthy for us and especially those with insulin issues include Primal Body Primal Mind by Nora Gedgaudas and many others.)c. Maybe a page of information explaining why vitamin C is so important as not just a vitamin but an anti-stress factor and how it used to be produced in the body by humans. Vitamin C can also be used to minimise symptoms while healing is happening, and can reduce fevers and the need for fever reducing drugs which have side effects.d. More information and specific examples about how much healing exactly may be expected, in particular when a person has been ill for many years. This would also make it clear to readers that to assume everyone who has this information could be completely cured is unrealistic and it'd be unfair to treat all ill people as if they could all be cured if they just did the right things. Some damage is permanent and I'd like to see at least some discussion of this in books on healing so people don't get the wrong idea and withhold help and assistance needed to ill people.I do understand that space in a book manuscript is very tight though and not everything can be included.All of the recommendations in the books can seem overwhelming, but all you need to do is start small. Do one small thing at a time and make gradual changes. The worst thing you could do, especially if you are very ill, is jump into taking and doing lots of different things all at once anyway. You have to start so slow with each thing if you are very ill!A big thank you to Dr Sherry Rogers for sharing all this valuable information!A last quote from Dr Sherry Rogers in `Detoxify or Die',`I have to laugh when people ask me if I do alternative, herbal, acupuncture or holistic medicine. 'No,' I reply. 'We do state-of-the-art medicine. In other words, we find the biochemical, nutritional and environmental causes and cures rather than blindly drugging everything. Sure, herbs are gentler, safer and more physiologic than drugs and holistic medicine attempts to incorporate many diverse modalities, etc. But there is no substitute for finding the underlying biochemical causes and cures. This is real medicine. This is where medicine should and would have been decades ago, if it had not been abducted by the pharmaceutical industry.'Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"This book was just not good. There is so much conflicting, bad and misleading information here.This book recommends so many unhealthy foods and even foods which are known to cause a leaky gut issue or prevent you from healing it. This book is not really about healing gut issues, just modifying the symptoms slightly maybe.This book thinks soy products including soy cheese are wonderful and also recommends rice milk and rice cheese, rice cakes, rice chips, canned soup, baked potato chips, instant oats, puffed cereal products and lots of other heavily processed, unhealthy, low-nutrient foods. Soy milk and cheese are not remotely healthy foods, as books like `The Whole Soy Story' explain. Advising people to cut right back on sugar but then telling them to eat tons of white bread and refined carbs - which the body instantly turns into sugar/glucose - is illogical.Highly allergenic foods such as soy milk are allowed on the 2 week dairy tolerances test diet, making the test useless and very misleading. Readers are told that if they don't feel better avoiding dairy for two weeks they are safe to drink it again - but they completely ignore the huge possibility that drinking soy milk in this two weeks could easily account for a lack of improvement in many very dairy sensitive people.A quiche recipe in this book uses egg whites only and also a bought pie crust. How healthy! Any nutrition book which is ignorant enough to tell you to throw out the yolk of an egg - the healthiest part of it and one of the healthiest foods we have albeit one surrounded by propaganda by the cholesterol myth supporters - well, fails as a nutritionist really. It is such ignorant advice. Use whole eggs to make a crustless quiche instead!The raw food diet is recommended and the same old nonsense about how high the enzyme content is and how this means you'll digest raw foods so easily. But it is absolute nonsense! Raw veggies are extremely difficult for those with digestive issues to digest, and can cause massive pain and bloating. It can feel like you have eaten rocks or pebbles to eat a bowl of raw veggies. Far easier to digest are slow cooked vegetables that are very soft such as those in soups and stews. Adding something that really is super high in enzymes such as homemade sauerkraut or kefir to your meal will help digestion significantly, but it is a myth that raw veggies do this. It's quite the opposite.There is a tiny amount of vitamin and mineral information, with a big focus on magnesium. There is also some information on herbs and also homeopathy and this information is given as much weight as the vitamin and mineral information. This could lead readers to waste all lots of time and money on these unnecessary extras rather than the essential vitamins and minerals which can actually treat the cause of a health issue and not just suppress or modify some symptoms.Forget this book and look into the GAPS diet book instead or the book by Dr Sherry Rogers on healing your gut and identifying food allergies etc. or Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life by Nora Gedgaudas. They each run rings around this book and are very well referenced and solid.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"If you can't eat all the packaged convenience foods you used to due to medical advice to avoid gluten or dairy then this book may be just what you are after to help you make your own gluten- and dairy-free versions of these foods at home.This book left an enormous amount to be desired in the healthiness and nutrient density of the recipes and also in basic nutritional knowledge. Some of it was terrible. Fake non-dairy cheese is included in some recipes, along with sunflower spread and hard white vegetable shortening. Unhealthy and just horrible!The author also recommends cooking and frying food in sunflower oil. But any good nutritionist will tell you that this is a fragile oil that should never be heated to high temperatures, as it so easily oxidises when heated. Eating oxidised oils is really not a good idea.The recipes are very sweet in some cases as well. One recipe for chocolate sauce had a cup of sugar in as well as soy milk. (Soy is anything but a health food, as books like `The Whole Soy Story' explain). But you can make a lovely chocolate sauce using coconut cream, 85% chocolate and a bit of honey. It'd taste far nicer and be a lot healthier. It was just so hard to see any benefits or point to the recipes in this book, yes they were gluten free but they could have been a lot tastier and better for you.There are a ton of better recipe books out there on this topic.

"This is a solid recipe book for anyone choosing to eat dairy, grain/gluten and legume free. It's great to have a recipe book where the meals don't contain lots of junk you are trying to avoid, and where all the recipes are not just gluten-free OR dairy-free etc. but all of these at once.I like that the book isn't all about trying to recreate unhealthy foods using healthy foods. That gets so boring and ties you to that unhealthy mindset for longer. A few replacements are listed such as spaghetti squash and a cauliflower mash to replace potato mash but I liked how the authors little comments on the top of the recipes made it clear it wasn't really aiming to taste like actual spaghetti etc. I like the tone the author has in this book a lot. The author is serious about real food yet this book has a light touch and is very engaging and likeable throughout as well. It is anything but one boring lecture.The book includes a list of panty essentials, ideas for a weekly cook-up and lots more tips. Each recipe comes with tips on how you could modify it and what you might like to pair it with. It could be a really great all-in-one basic foundation book for someone wanting to go from a standard diet to a really healthy one but that isn't sure where to start. You'd need to have a bit of time to cook though, and work everything out.I had a very few minor quibbles with the book such as the use of frozen veggies *barf!* and the use of iodised sea salt. If it is iodised it is not real unrefined sea salt. Iodised salt is to be avoided.The food photos are good and the recipe layout is clear. I found the book horrible to view on my Kindle due to the 2 column format though, as it displayed at about 4 point text even with the screen set to sideways. But on my computer there are no problems with viewing the text of course. I'm going to delete it off my Kindle now. The photos were lovely but there did seem to be a lot of photos as compared to the number of text pages, possibly.I got this book for just a few dollars as part of a health themed ebook bundle. I'm following a gluten/dairy/legume-free diet as part of a program to improve a serious neurological disease. I like the look of quite a few recipes here, more than I do in many Paleo type books. I'm excited to try the sunflower seed satay sauce and basil/walnut pesto recipes very soon, and I'm going to see if I can find coconut aminos at a shop near me.

"A friend put me on to these recently and they are so much easier to use than standard dental floss I was hooked right away. Made my day really as I had been finding normal flossing very difficult and not been doing it as much as I should.I bought 3 or 4 different brand ones at first and this is the only one that didn't fray and break. It is the only brand I will be buying from now on even if these are a bit more expensive than some.I don't throw mine away after a single use, I prefer to clean and reuse them. If you can clean and reuse a toothbrush head, why not these things, I reckon. They work well and leave your mouth feeling very clean.I really recommend giving these a try especially if you are ill and have issues with hand strength and flexibility.

"Book one in this series is a fascinating read. It reminds us how slow the medical profession is to accept new ideas, even when the evidence for them is overwhelming. There is so much more going on than unbiased and logical analysis of the evidence.The idea that the medical profession has no vested interests but the best patient care is not just called into question but proved to be not the case again and again over many hundreds of years by the information in this book. Many case studies and examples given are quite shocking - for example how long it took doctors to agree to wash their hands before delivering babies, and how the doctor that first identified this problem and pushed for handwashing was ridiculed and suffered a huge blow to his standing and career. New information in the medical field is rarely received well, as this book explains.Doctors unwillingness to admit they were wrong is a huge problem and this affects individual doctors as well as the profession as a whole. There is also the issue of financial liability for doctors and medical organisations as well. When does the medical profession ever admit it is wrong? They almost never do. Yet the medical profession has a high degree of public trust.We need to be aware that much of what is promoted as `absolute medical fact' today has already been utterly disproven. Yet it persists and will do for many years to come due to vested financial interests involved in medicine as well as how slow medicine is to accept new ideas. We should not assume that the mainsteam medical information we are given is based on logic. Often this is not the case.We should also not assume that following what is accepted as best practice in mainstream medicine will give us the best health outcomes. At best the information may be decades behind the latest research and especially when it comes to anything not closely aligned with drug company profits.From the author/book cover:""This book is dedicated to the memory of all those medical doctors who, since history has been recorded, have contributed to the progress of the science and art of medicine. Medical Mavericks are practitioners who did not follow conventional paths. Instead they chose to go where there is no path and leave a trail. This is not an easy journey. Schopenhauers made the observation that new thought and new truth most often go through three stages. First they are ridiculed. Next they are violently opposed. Then, finally they are accepted as being self-evident. Medical Mavericks Volume One chronicles the tales of 17 different practitioners who were mavericks in their thinking.The word ""maverick"" is derived from an American pioneer, Samuel A. Maverick, who chose not to brand his cattle. Through usage the word ""maverick"", in addition to meaning an unbranded range animal, has come to mean an independent individual who refuses, because of what he or she has learned, to conform to prevailing group thought.Often reviled by their contemporaries, medical mavericks blazed the trail of scientific progress. These tales of discovery, personal hardship, court intrigues, and hardball professional rivalry make for fascinating reading. Medical Mavericks will raise the eyebrows of many, and bring a sense of relief to contemporary mavericks who can take comfort in the thought that at least they aren't being burned at the stake.The word maverick is derived from an American pioneer Samuel A. Maverick who chose to not brand his cattle. Through usage the word maverick in addition to meaning an unbranded range animal has come to mean an independent individual who refuses to confrom to his group. This book could just as accurately have been titled ""One person can make a difference"" or ""Burn him at the stake and use damp straw."" Often reviled by their comtemporaries but revered by subsequent generations these medical mavericks blazed the trail of scientific progress. These tales of discovery personal hardship court intrigues and hardball professional rivalry make for fascinating reading.""Book three in the series makes this already good book concept even better by adding in case studies of some of the world's orthomolecular medicine pioneers. Information is given on Dr Abram Hoffer, Dr R. Cathcart, Dr Cheraskin, Roger Williams, Linus Pauling and many others. The chapters on Hoffer, Pauling and Riordan were the standouts for me.From the third book: ""Medical Mavericks: Volume Three, is the completion of Dr. Riordan's trilogy of biographical vignettes about these fascinating trailblazers. It also marks Dr. Riordan's final publication. This book is dedicated to the maverick in you - that wonderful element perhaps obvious, perhaps hidden, which has moved you to choose to read this bit of writing.""Dr Riordan was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin Medical School, and had practiced clinical medicine for nearly 50 years. He is also quite a medical trailblazer himself as the book `Pyramid on the Praerie' explains. He has done a great job with this book and I recommend it, along with the other two books in the series. The myth of the lack of bias in the medical profession has to die! There is bias, and it is large.Thank goodness for all those real medical pioneers out there. And free excellent health books!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

There is so much more going on than unbiased and logical analysis of the evidence.The idea that the medical profession has no vested interests but the best patient care is not just called into question but proved to be not the case again and again over many hundreds of years by the information in this book.Many case studies and examples given are quite shocking - for example how long it took doctors to agree to wash their hands before delivering babies, and how the doctor that first identified this problem and pushed for handwashing was ridiculed and suffered a huge blow to his standing and career. New information in the medical field is rarely received well, as this book explains.Doctors unwillingness to admit they were wrong is a huge problem and this affects individual doctors as well as the profession as a whole. There is also the issue of financial liability for doctors and medical organisations as well. When does the medical profession ever admit it is wrong? They almost never do. Yet the medical profession has a high degree of public trust.We need to be aware that much of what is promoted as `absolute medical fact' today has already been utterly disproven. Yet it persists and will do for many years to come due to vested financial interests involved in medicine as well as how slow medicine is to accept new ideas. We should not assume that the mainsteam medical information we are given is based on logic. Often this is not the case.We should also not assume that following what is accepted as best practice in mainstream medicine will give us the best health outcomes. At best the information may be decades behind the latest research and especially when it comes to anything not closely aligned with drug company profits.From the author/book cover:""This book is dedicated to the memory of all those medical doctors who, since history has been recorded, have contributed to the progress of the science and art of medicine. Medical Mavericks are practitioners who did not follow conventional paths. Instead they chose to go where there is no path and leave a trail. This is not an easy journey. Schopenhauers made the observation that new thought and new truth most often go through three stages. First they are ridiculed. Next they are violently opposed. Then, finally they are accepted as being self-evident. Medical Mavericks Volume One chronicles the tales of 17 different practitioners who were mavericks in their thinking.The word ""maverick"" is derived from an American pioneer, Samuel A. Maverick, who chose not to brand his cattle. Through usage the word ""maverick"", in addition to meaning an unbranded range animal, has come to mean an independent individual who refuses, because of what he or she has learned, to conform to prevailing group thought.This book is about such independent individuals who have followed the advice found in this anonymous quotation:""Do not follow where,The path may lead.Go instead whereThere is no path,And leave a trail.""Often reviled by their contemporaries, medical mavericks blazed the trail of scientific progress. These tales of discovery, personal hardship, court intrigues, and hardball professional rivalry make for fascinating reading. Medical Mavericks will raise the eyebrows of many, and bring a sense of relief to contemporary mavericks who can take comfort in the thought that at least they aren't being burned at the stake.The word maverick is derived from an American pioneer Samuel A. Maverick who chose to not brand his cattle. Through usage the word maverick in addition to meaning an unbranded range animal has come to mean an independent individual who refuses to confrom to his group. This book could just as accurately have been titled ""One person can make a difference"" or ""Burn him at the stake and use damp straw."" Often reviled by their comtemporaries but revered by subsequent generations these medical mavericks blazed the trail of scientific progress. These tales of discovery personal hardship court intrigues and hardball professional rivalry make for fascinating reading.""Book two in the series continues what book one started. It includes many more case studies and details of very sad lost opportunities. It's a madddening but enlightening read.Dr Riordan was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin Medical School, and had practiced clinical medicine for nearly 50 years. He is also quite a medical trailblazer himself as the book `Pyramid on the Praerie' explains. He has done a great job with this book and I recommend it, along with the other two books in the series. The myth of the lack of bias in the medical profession has to die! There is bias, and it is large.Thank goodness for all those real medical pioneers out there.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"These sorts of files are so much better than metal files or pumice stones or those impossible to use pumice stones on sticks things. This file is very easy to use and because it is quite fine, it gives a superior result to harsher products. It is also very easy and quick to use. The wooden handle/body of the file is also very sturdy and easy to hold making the product easier to get a grip on than similar products which have a thin plastic handle/body which bends when in use.

"These socks feel very nice and soft and fit well. I like that they have a nice nature-y print on and also that they have a heel sewn in so you always wear them the same way up, so the dirty side stays on the bottom and they don't move around or slide off. They do what they are supposed to when worn after applying a good natural heel moisturiser cream and are comfortable enough that you almost don't feel like you're wearing socks ar all. Couldn't ask for more. The moisturising gloves by the same company are just as good too.

"Linus Pauling is a real hero to me and his intelligence, logic and compassion for people come through on every page of this book. The world would be a far better place with more people like him in it.Having said that, after reading this book I do think it is clear he continually honed his message and the basic points he wanted to make about nutrition and orthomolecular medicine as time went on. For that reason I would recommend reading Pauling's book 'How to Live Longer and Feel Better' above this earlier (though still excellent and historially very important) book.'How to Live Longer and Feel Better' includes a lot of the excellent vitamin C infomation contained in this book but also so much more. The discussion has a lot more depth, more research is quoted and practical advice is given about a basic but fairly complete orthomolecular program and not just how much vitamin C to take. It is pretty wonderful.This is a slightly paraphrased version of Pauling's basic regimen for a healthy life:* Take 6 - 18 g of vitamin C daily* Take 400 IU, 800 IU or 1600 IU of natural vitamin E daily* Take 1 - 2 B vitamin supplements daily* Take 25 000 IU of vitamin A daily* Take a multimineral tablet daily* Keep your intake of sugar low* Eat what you like in moderation, but avoid sugar. Meat and eggs are good, and fruit and vegetables are good. Don't eat too much of any one food and don't eat so much that you become overweight.* Drink plenty of water* Keep active, but do not severely overexert yourself physically.* Drink alcohol in moderation only* DO NOT SMOKE CIGARETTES* Avoid stress, work at a job you like, be happy with your family.This is just such a great and simple list, I had to type it out for those who can't read/afford the book. (Note that Pauling comments that the amounts given for supplements are for healthy people, and that those suffering serious illness may need higher doses of some of these, including vitamin C to bowel tolerance.)It's appalling that more than 20 years after this book was published, the same old scaremongering (ie. lying!) about the safety of vitamins and their effectiveness is still going on, and people are still being told vitamins are not safe, helpful or necessary and that all that is needed is a balanced diet. (A nice story, but one that isn't based on fact.) Sadly, the same old nonsense that Pauling describes, where vitamin studies are set up to fail by those who want to prove that vitamins don't work, is still happening; doses much smaller than would be effective are used, the time periods are too short to allow the vitamin to actually work, and so on. Many different studies are quoted in a lot of detail, thus Pauling's arguments are very convincing.Pauling had high hopes that all this was about to start changing and that soon vitamins would become far more accepted and used in mainstream medicine. To some extent that has happened, but for the most part little has really changed. It's quite depressing.I'm very passionate about vitamin C due to the amazing books on it I have read, and all the accounts by doctors that were or are vitamin C experts and also because of the impact it has had on my own life and the lives of others I know. I got this book of Pauling's because I had heard that it went into detail about why humans lost the ability to synthesise vitamin C, and why it is almost impossible to regain this ability even if it would not be very beneficial for humans to do so. And it did. I now understand that issue much better than I did before.Other excellent vitamin C books include Ascorbate: The Science of Vitamin C and Vitamin C: The Real Story, the Remarkable and Controversial Healing Factor and The Healing Factor: ""Vitamin C"" Against Disease (available free online) plus articles online by Dr Cathcart and Dr Klenner and most of all probably, the books Primal Panacea and 'Curing the Incurable: Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins' by the brilliant Dr T Levy. These last 2 books are about the only ones I know of which also discuss liposomal vitamin C which allows you to get many/all of the benefits of IVC orally. Liposomal vitamin C is wonderful stuff whether you're using it to maintain health, prevent or treat a cold or flu or any other disease.A big thank you to all the vitamin C pioneers!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"I found this product much easier to use than the Himalayan Institute one. If you have weakness in your arms (as I do) then the more ergonomic design of this pot really does make it easier and more comfortable to use.The design of this pot makes you use less arm strength to hoold it up as you don't have to hold it so far away from your face. You can hold it up by kind of bracing your arm against your face. It also means it holds more water so you can do both nostrils on one fill, and the pot also spills a lot less often due to the spill barrier it has.Used daily the neti pot has made an amazing difference to my allergies and sinus pain due to allergies. It just makes so much sense to do this before you consider taking pills to just suppress the symptoms. Having allergies and not using a neti pot daily is madness! It helps so much and is so easy. It takes only a minute and a half a day and while slightly annoying to do, is not at all hard or unpleasant to do once you get the hang of it.I'm often surprised by how well I can breathe after doing a neti pot in the morning, how much doing one has reduced or gotten rid of a headache and even sometimes a fuzzy brain...and how quickly the endless sneezing and sinus pain comes back if I forget to do it for a week or so.If you aren't suffering with arm strength issues etc. and don't mind refilling your pot a bit more often then both pots are probably close to equally good and all that matters is that you use them often.

"This 1979 book is an interesting read. It is a bit dated and the book would likely be very different if written today yet it is also true that the same core issues of ignorance and corruption in medicine remain. Hospitals are still causing lots of unnecessary suffering for their patients and for many doctors their `high and mighty' attitude is as present as ever.  To get the best care we need to question established medical practice and all of our doctors, as much as possible. The medical profession is very slow to change and slow to admit they were wrong about anything, if they admit it at all. Mainsteam medicine and media is so far behind when it comes to the best health information in many fields. You have to do your own unbiased research and be your own advocate.If only more doctors and more importantly PATIENTS understood that 'every drug stresses and hurts your body in some way' and that 'doctors are not trained to attack the core of any problem, merely to suppress symptoms' as this author explains. Ignorant doctors with good intentions can still do a lot of harm.I disagree with the `universal healthcare is bad' message of the author's and a few other things but this is still a funny and sharp and useful book that is worth reading, if not that high up on my recommended health books list due to there being so many other must-read titles.Linus Pauling, Dr Abram Hoffer, Dr Sheery Rogers and others have brilliant books out on this topic.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"After reading all the glowing reviews of this book I found the book itself quite underwhelming. What this does well is explain the basics of kidney disease and the tests used to diagnose and monitor it. It is a good basic guide or very simple beginners guide.Even with the basics I often found parts of the book too brief to tell me what I wanted to know and I ended up doing lots of extra internet searches to clarify points the book made. I wont ever read this book again and I don't think it was a good value purchase for me.The information about being a major participant in your own healthcare was good. The advice to get two or three second opinions and that does so is not cowardice but wisdom, is also good.The dietary advice is mixed. Advice to avoid allergens and gluten in the diet was good to see (as many experts point to links between food allergies and gluten and kidney disorders), but advice to eat soy and lots of whole grains and to avoid saturated fat in the diet is misguided.For anyone considering buying this book primarily for the discussion of `complementary therapies' it contains I would say don't bother. I was hoping for information that was specific to kidney disease and which also talked about any particular issues kidney patients may have with supplementation. Things that are needed in higher amounts than usual or things which should be avoided, or avoided by some perhaps. But it was all very brief and superficial and generic. It wasn't all that up-to-date either. You could easily get information of this quality online in just a few minutes of internet searching. You can get instructions to take small doses of a few random things such as CoQ10 anywhere!Maintaining good vitamin D levels is mentioned as is taking higher amounts of B1 to lessen protein in the urine. Meditation, probiotics and losing weight are recommended. Unfortunately the myth about high dose vitamin C causing kidney stones is included in the book (for the facts on this see `Primal Panacea' by Dr T. Levy.) Diuretic drugs are mentioned but only really as a way of lowering blood pressure. The difference between mineral sparing herbal or other diuretics vs. diuretic drugs which can dangerously deplete minerals such as magnesium wasn't discussed.I was surprised that stinging nettle herb as tea or capsules and asparagus extract tea or capsules weren't mentioned as these two things have helped me enormously due to their diuretic actions and the way they let you drink a lot more water and so flush your kidneys out really well. I was put onto them by a friend that has had kidney issues and decided to give them a try after researching their effctiveness and suitability online and in books. The extra kidney flushing these products allowed seemed to be just what I needed.Mostly drug based treatments are supported and few warnings are given about the drugs recommended. Books such as `Is Your Cardiologist Killing You?' and `Detoxify or Die' and others explain that the Ace inhibitors or blood pressure medications recommended in this book can in fact have catastrophic effects on your health and that treating the actual causes of the issues that led to the drug prescription makes so much more sense. But this book talks barely at all about what may cause kidney problems and treating these causes once found. Mostly it is aimed at finding good ways to suppress symptoms using drugs. Many drugs are recommended including statin drugs and few warnings are given about them. For real information about finding and treating causes of disease I recommend books by Dr Sherry Rogers and others.I'm not reviewing this book as someone that has even stage 1 or 2 kidney disease. I do not have kidney disease as such luckily. My tests don't show that. Just mild unspecified kidney problems of 12 months duration which with some treatment interventions are improving as each month passes.This book explains the kidneys can be `stunned' by illness or dehydration and that detoxification issues or dehydration can lead to various kidney issues. I have some sort of mild kidney issue and have done for about a year now and it may be caused by dehydration while doing a dedicated detoxification regime (?) or things I have done in the past such as eat a higher protein diet for a few years. It may also just be the latest lovely part of the severe neurological disease I have called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) which also affects all organs and all metabolic and detoxification functions. Some patients with M.E. do have kidney disease so there does seem to be a link there. I am just not sure, and I'd hoped to find out more about `other' kidney problems which aren't strictly diagnosable kidney disease or kidney stones or a UTI in this book but I had no such luck.This topic was barely discussed which was a shame as I would have loved to have gotten some answers for my own case. All I can do is keep going doing what I am doing I guess and hope it disappears soon. I was eating very well and allergen and gluten-free and taking a basic orthomolecular program already and so have just added to it daily nettle tea and asparagus capsules and a higher and more consistent (and focused on early morning drinking) water intake - plus extra liposomal vitamin C for when I get mild fevers or pain related to my kidneys etc. The C is a lifesaver and so are the two herbal diuretics. So far so good. I'm improving constantly if slowly so I suppose I can't complain.Overall this book is good on the basics of kidney disease diagnosis and testing, contains the standard basic drug recommendations and a tiny amount of mixed diet and supplement advice. It is a very short and simple read that will probably leave you with more questions to ask than answered. Best wishes to everyone battling serious kidney disease.Update December 2013: I have just found out the actual cause of my unusual kidney issues! It was damage to the nerves in my bladder (and kidney too?) caused by severe vitamin B12 deficiency. Demyelination of the nerves. If this had not been discovered when it was or in the next year or two I would have ended up eventually doubly incontinent and possibly unable to walk. So if you have any unusual bladder or kidney issues such as burning kidney pain and UTI-like symptoms (with normal or abnormal UTI tests), oedema, feelings of incomplete bladder emptying, inability to start urination and a hard bloated stomach please look into vitamin B12 deficiency and at least rule it out. The book Could It Be B12?: An Epidemic of Misdiagnoses will tell you all you need to know.It's one of the few health isuses where treatment is very simple once correctly diagnosed and if caught in time the damage can all be reversed. I'm doing great and am only about 40 days into treatment. It'd be great if the author talked about this common cause of kidney and bladder issues in future editions of this book.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"It's flawed in parts but I got a lot out of this book overall. The core messages of this book are solid and timely; Listen to your body and eat real food that makes you feel good. Starving yourself to be thinner ends in weight gain for most of us and a raising of your set-point weight, so don't do it. Move in ways that make you feel good without worrying about burning calories. Don't pay attention to super-skinny ideals or weight-loss-diet-hype and just do what works for you and makes you feel healthiest. Skinniness is not the same as healthiness and it is the latter which is most important.The writing of the book seemed clumsy at times. I feel the main points could have been put more simply and that some of the text was too long and meandering in getting to a point.The parts on accepting and finding your set-point weight were quite good. One of the strongest parts of the book was the letters at the back of the book which were to give to family to let them know it'd be great if they made no positive or negative comments about your size changing because you're focusing on health and not mere weight change. A letter for doctors was also included.There are also some not-so-good parts of this book. I feel this book would have been a lot stronger if the sections on nutrition were omitted entirely and the book just made the points about health being more important than weight more clearly and powerfully. The author should focus on the topic she really knows a lot about.The nutrition information in this book really is bad. It's basically a description of the food pyramid. 30% of calories from fat is talked about as way too much fat - this despite the fact lipid experts such as Mary Enig PhD say that for some of us 30% is nowhere near enough dietary fat. 10% of calories from protein is said to be too high a protein intake. So what you're left with is a diet that is probably 70% or more carbohydrate. That is a level many of us just cannot cope with and which makes us feel constantly starving hungry, ill and weak even after meals. Not to mention making us gain weight like crazy even if we're putting everything we have into eating in a healthy way.For some of us eating beans counts as a hungry-making starch food, not a protein food. Not telling readers that some people just can't cope with high-carb diets and are not suited to them sets them up for failure following the HAES plan and then blaming themselves for it. The same is true for people with food allergies to common foods such as grains and soy. Eating foods you are allergic to makes you crave them, it is one of the symptoms. The concept of eating the same old junk but in moderation just doesn't work for many of us. It sets us up to fail.The message to enjoy junk foods and other not-so-healthy common foods in moderation is problematic. Some of us physically can't eat these foods in moderation, that is the whole problem. They do things to our bodies which shut off our bodies natural satiety signals and make us feel unwell afterwards too - or constantly unwell if we eat them often enough. This subject is tackled brilliantly in the book `A Life Unburdened' - I highly recommend it. It also explains why saturated fat is a healthy food that is good for you, along with cholesterol-containing foods! It is the new fangled unnatural fats which don't suit us, not the ones we have been eating for tens of thousands of years such as animal fat.There is so much wrong information in the nutritional chapters, but it's also very badly written and constantly contradicts itself. The research quality is poor. The author says we have virtually the same genes today as our Paleolithic ancestors had so we will do best eating the same diet they did - a diet which gave animal foods very special importance. Then she says that because of industrial meat farming practices the best way to emulate a Paleo diet today is to eat a diet of mostly plants with meat there as a condiment only or avoided entirely because everyone knows meat and animal fat is unhealthy. Ummm...what?High-fibre (highly processed) breakfast cereals are super healthy and so are highly-processed foods such as tofu says the author. The huge problems with soy as a staple food (as explained in books like `The Whole Soy Story') are never mentioned. The problems with anti-nutrients in whole grains are never mentioned as of course are the ways to soak and otherwise prepare grains to reduce them. The book repeats lots of myths about fibre and omits information that explains that for some of us a lower fibre diet and fibre from vegetables and fruits only (and not grains) suits us best. No amount of fibre in your diet will make your meals satisfying to you if you aren't eating enough fat in your diet, or protein.Accurate information on eating what our ancestors ate and the foods our genes are best suited to is in books such as `Primal Body, Primal Mind.'I'm not convinced by the `thrify gene' theory this book puts so much importance in. A few good books - such as `Good Calories, Bad Calories' - have done a great job debunking this myth far more convincingly. Seeing how ignorant and misled the author was on basic nutrition theory it also made it hard to have much faith in the quality of some of the more novel ideas on body chemistry and weight regulation put forth in this book.At the end of one of the nutrition chapters the author says that if in doubt eat food that is as whole as possible and as minimally messed with as possible. That should have been the entire nutrition section really. Eating what makes you feel good makes sense but doing so when guided by a bit of basic nutrition knowledge is essential too, especially if you have any health or nutrition issues. It helps you better understand the messages your body is trying to send you.I give the sections on focusing on health and not the scales 4.5 out of 5. I give the nutrition section 1 out of 5 so have settled on a 3 star rating overall. I'd love to see an updated edition of this book that was much shorter and sharper and that omitted all nutrition information. I'd buy several copies for friends and family. But right now I couldn't give anyone a book with such problematic nutrition information in it.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"This book is written by an expert in the field and contains a lot of good information. Dr Ian E. Brighthope talks in this book about the different types of diabetes (there are more than just two), the vital need to avoid junk food, sugar and large amounts of processed starch, and the need for properly dosed and chosen nutritional supplements along with a healthy diet.This book contains only a very small amount of dietary information and what is included could be of better quality to be fair. The information on sugar being a toxic chemical is very good. But the awful DASH diet is supported, despite the fact the science on low-salt diets is dodgy and unrefined sea salt has many health benefits. So is the Mediterranean diet, with lots of legumes and starch in. Only a sentence or so is included about the need for some people to limit carbohydrate intake quite severely, and that some people do best eliminating foods such as legumes and grains. Food allergies or intolerances or macronutrient ratios are not mentioned at all.What this book does really well is explain which supplements are most important for people with diabetes and why. It covers the basics and is a great starting point although it really doesn't go into looking into your own nutrient levels with tests, or finding your own individual illness triggers or causes and that sort of thing. Clear information is given about dosages. The doses recommended are up-to-date and not the too-low-to-do-much-good ones contained in many books and especially older books. The book also doesn't neglect the basic necessary nutrients in favour of discussing herbs or other non-vital products, as many books do. Taking herbs and other fancy and exotic things before making sure you have the basic necessary vitamins etc. covered is madness!The book warns readers throughout to get help with working out dosages from a qualified practitioner if at all possible, and especially if you think you need to take some items are the higher dosages listed. It takes quite a cautious approach to some extent.I did find one error in the book that should have been picked up by the editor. The section on vitamin B2 says that the maximum safe dosage is 5-10 mg daily which seems to be an error. This is bizarrely low for a start but also later in the book a B100 supplement is recommended to be taken daily. B100 supplements contain 100 mg of vitamin B2 (riboflavin). The dosages of vitamin C generally recommended also seemed quite low (1-4 grams daily minimum) when considered with the safety, affordability and usefulness of far higher doses. A dose of 10-20 grams is mentioned at one point though along with vitamin C given by IV.I don't have diabetes, only hyperinsulinism, hypoglycaemia and a PCOS diagnosis, along with having a severe neurological disease that is slowly improving through the use of orthomolecular medicine etc. I read this book because I wanted to check out the cut of Dr Brighthope's jib because he's the only Australian on the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine board.If your major health issue is diabetes this book is a good one to read. It gives you an excellent overview of supplements for this condition. To read good quality and far more detailed books on diet there's The Schwartzbein Principle, Primal Body, Primal Mind or The Perfect Health Diet and many others. Not much point taking lots of supplements if your diet is poor as it'd impede your progress enormously.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"This book is an interesting and compelling read. After detailing some fascinating experiments on regrowing limbs and detailing the electrical systems of animals the author explains that there is a massive bias towards establishment and authority rather than facts. Medicine is operating more like a religion than a science and new ideas are suppressed or ridiculed and their originators often punished.Scientists' pronouncements are often self serving and misleading. We're learning more and more about less and less. Studies on trivial topics are often funded while important research gets no support as it threatens the status quo. Yet the public largely thinks that the study of medicine is based on science and logic.This book explains that promise of a future of golden health and extended life thanks to wonder drugs and fancy new surgical techniques and the like turns out to be empty. The body has an amazing capacity to heal, but only if we give it the tools it needs to do so - adequate nutrition and all the necessary vitamins and minerals etc.Keeping pollution to tolerable levels is also vital for health and EMF pollution, the author explains, is at least as dangerous as air pollution or common toxic exposures. At the moment we're all participating in a giant experiment to see how harmful EMFs really are. We need to know more about EMF issues but a multitude of risks are well already well documented. For more on this topic including practical tips on minimising the health problems EMFs can cause the book on 'grounding' called  Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever? by Martin Zucker is worth a read.Lots of drawings and descriptions of cutting off limbs from frogs and salamanders are included in the first part of the book. Readers squeamish about animal experiments may find parts of this book difficult to read.Reading the findings and also problems and unfair criticism and political opposition faced by those with genuinely new ideas on health and healing is wonderful and inspiring but also somewhat depressing. We need many more scientists with this much integrity, intelligence, logic and insight to even make a dent in the corrupt corporate medicine system we have. Year after year the quality of medical studies gets worse. The drugs-are-the answer-for everything marketing hype gets ever more shrill and monotonous and detracts ever more from real medicine based on reason and scientific fact.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"This is a useful little book for anyone due to have a hospital stay in the near future and also just anyone interested in getting the best health outcomes for themselves and their family generally.Some of the facts and statistics given in this book are shocking. It doesn't sugar-coat any of the grim facts but it also provides a lot of reason for hope and positivity in the way it describes how to improve your outcomes and empower yourself.This book explains that:* Corporate medicine is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the US. It kills tens of thousands of people every year. Problems include financial conflicts of interest, poor management, complacency and misinformation, a lack of focus on personal health responsibility and many others.* It is not actually clear whether hospitals give benefit or not, overall. Emergency medicine saves many lives but it is not clear whether this and other interventions outweighs all those killed by drug side effects, drug interactions, DVTs, hospital-borne infections, and so on.* Hospitals should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. They are dangerous places to be.* 30% of patients that die in hospital die due to a misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis is a huge problem.* Many doctors do not read tests or study results properly and do not understand complex statistics. This ignorance is taken advanatge of by drug comapnies to make certain drugs appear far more effective than they actually are.* It's rational to be paranoid about corporate medicine and hospitals. Medicine based on personal bias and profit doesn't give the best outcomes. Trusting authority is not the same as supporting good science.* Polypharmacy is dangerous. Each drug has risks of side effects and very time a new drug is added it has its own risk of side effects as well plus extra risks due to drug interactions. Drugs should be kept to a small number and minimised as much as possible. Many drugs have vitamin or mineral alternatives which are very safe, effective and inexpensive.* Don't be talked into taking any drug to prevent a disease you don't have. Avoid statins and daily aspirin.* Medicine has a shameful history of following authority rather than data and reason. The new term 'evidence based medicine' is misleading to say the least.* Psychiatry is not scientific. ""Psychiatrists should realise that their discipline is not scientific and would be well advised to show a little humility.""* Producing negative studies on nutrition and vitamins is very easy to do and is often done to suit the interests of certain vested interest groups such as drug companies. Studies designed to fail often use the wrong form of the nutrient, in the wrong dose, without supportive nutrients and/or with too short a follow-up time. Any treatment can be 'proved' to be ineffective if the study is set up in a certain way.* Many doctors are ethical and caring and would not knowingly harm a patient. The problem is with the way medicine is organised and controlled.The book outlines many problems but also spends a lot of time talking about solutions as well.Information is included on how to negotiate with your doctor, the importance of developing a good relationship with your doctor, how much should you defer to your doctor and when should you stop trying to negotiate, what your rights are to refuse or demand a treatment, what your rights are with taking your own supplements in hospital, how to win medical arguments or at least lose less often, how much should you expect a doctor to listen to you and your own research findings, why making idle threats of legal action or backing doctors into a corner may get you worse medical care than you'd have gotten otherwise, and lots more.Some of the most helpful information given was on how to choose a good doctor and what questions to ask before you agree to see them and pay for a consult.The book also provides a very easy to read and follow beginners guide to orthomolecular medicine that can be used before and after surgery to speed healing, to prevent DVTs and bedsores, to treat heart disease, or to prevent illness and improve health generally. The doses recommended are up-to-date and not the too-low-to-do-much-good ones contained in many books and especially older books. The book also doesn't neglect the basic necessary nutrients in favour of discussing herbs or other non-vital products, as many books do. Taking herbs and other fancy and exotic things before making sure you have the basic necessary vitamins etc. covered is madness!One in ten hospital deaths are due to clotting issues. A simple nutritional protocol is included which can cut the risk of DVT dramatically when taken before and after a hospital stay. It involves basic supplements such as high-dose vitamin C, fish oil, and vitamin E etc.  Vitamin C at an appropriate dose can improve your changes of surviving a hospital stay significantly. 3 - 10 grams a day (preferably 10 grams) is a minimal dose and if possible a bowel tolerance dose is best. A bowel tolerance dose varies from person to person and how ill a person is; the more ill you are the more vitamin C your body needs.This book does just focus on doctor and hospital related issues and so doesn't contain enough information on how to really get stuck into healing serious disease with orthomolecular medicine. For that one needs to read some of the other books by these authors, or others such as Linus Pauling, Dr T. Levy, Dr Sherry Rogers etc. This book also has little information on diet aside from a few general comments about avoiding junk food and sugar - and most food served in hospitals.I'd have liked a lot more information about the huge problem of misdiagnosis and the disastrous-for-patients use of wastebasket diagnoses. But that is a personal bias I guess. These let the doctor off the hook by giving the patient a meaningless label instead of a real diagnosis and also stops anyone looking for the real cause of symptoms. Many are labelled as mentally ill or with motivational or attitude probelms or malingering when they in fact have a physical disease too. Wastebasket diagnoses have enormous benefits for medical insurance companies as well, which seems to be their main purpose. Many payouts are far smaller for 'controversial' or psychiatric diseases than they would be for the patient's correct diagnosis of a real and physical disease. Diseases caused by chemical exposures, prescription drugs and poor food quality are also conveniently hidden. It is a huge problem which affects some of our most ill and vulnerable people. It's hidden in plain sight with most people having no idea about the issue at all.Dr Abram Hoffer is a very well respected orthomolecular pioneer and has authored many books on the topic. He died in 2009 and this was the last book he worked on. Dr Hoffer has a very long history with having to try and battle the current medical system to try and get the best outcomes for his patients. Along with the other authors, he really knows what he is talking about on this topic.Overall this book is very good. The authors have done a great job with it and should be congratulated. It contains lots of information essential to us all. It could be really helpful for lots of people or even life-saving, especially for those not already acquainted with basic orthomolecular medicine principles.This book advises readers to act rationally when making health decisions and to think for themselves and not trust doctors or any other medical authority, blindly. Being compliant and just doing and thinking what you're told is not the way to get your best health outcome. It is very had to argue with that!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"This is an excellent product, but I have to say I'm not a fan of some of the very overstated claims and hype on the Unique E website which imply theirs is the only safe and effective product to take. Carlson products are also very good, and very similar, and their labelling is better and clearer as well without use of vague terms like 'proprietary blend' which set my warning bells ringing just a bit. How much gamma does this product have? I think I read it listed as 30% on their website but why can't this be stated clearly on the label?There is a pump pack version of this product but it is so much cheaper and probably a lot easier to buy the Unique E capsules instead and just cut them open and eat the contents, if you want to take as few gelatin capsules as possible. If you snip a capsule with scissors once across the middle then put it in your mouth and bite down on it a few times you can easily swallow all the E and then you just take the empty smashed up capsule out of your mouth and throw it away. The taste is fine as it is with other very good quality E products such as Carlsons.This product is also made from GMO soy oil I assume as it does not say non-GMO or organic on the label (although I'm told apparently the site now says it's non GMO. Perhaps this changed recently?). I feel the labelling and marketing is a bit misleading on this issue. Even if the soy is highly refined and so no longer an allergy risk, some of us would prefer soy- and clearly labelled 100% certainty GMO-free products anyway. It'd be great if the company made a non-soy version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OKHATQUYF05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RI6LDA#wasThisHelpful","R18OKHATQUYF05","A2C7VMN9UAYYDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C7VMN9UAYYDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By my costings a dose of Unique E in a capsule costs 26 cents, while the same dose in this pump pack costs you 43c! Almost double. I had assumed the pump pack version would be cheaper but the pump bottle must add a lot to the cost of the product. So far the pump dispenser is working well for me, maybe because the weather is warm so far. I'm not sure how it'll go in winter. I wonder if this product would be a lot more cost effective if the bottle held more than a measly 30 ml/1 floz?As it is the only reason to buy this product is if you want your supplements to be 100% vegan.Otherwise it is so much cheaper and probably a lot easier to buy the Unique E capsules instead and just cut them open and eat the contents, if you want to take as few galatin capsules as possible. If you snip a capsule with scissors once across the middle then put it in your mouth and bite down on it a few times you can easily swallow all the E and then you just take the empty smashed up capsule out of your mouth and throw it away. The taste is fine.I've contacted the company that makes this and they said the pump pack version is expensive compared to the capsules because of the lower number of units sold.

"This product's website says that if you take their 2 E products you'll be getting all all 4 tocotrienols and all 4 tocopherols yet the label of this their tocotrienols product says it has delta-T3 (90%) and gamma-T3 (10%). Where are the alpha and beta tocotrienols? It is confusing.I have read that alpha tocotrienol has particular benefits but it seems like this product has none of that at all. ""Each beef softgel capsule contains High-Delta and Gamma Delta-Gold Tocotrienols derived from the Annatto Bean and contains the highest concentrates of tocotrienols at 125 mg per gel capsule.""The capsule is the tiniest I have seen which I really like. I've been cutting mine open and eating the contents. A strange taste lingers for a while afterwards (unlike other milder tasting tocotrienol products I have had before) but it isn't too bad.Until the issue with this product only having two of the four tocotrienols is cleared up though I am going to go back to the Carlson's Tocotrienols product which is also very pure and which clearly lists the exact amounts of all four tocotrienol dosages on the label.This product would also be better in a 180 capsule count rather than just 60, to save on plastic a bit.I have to say I'm also not a fan of some of the very overstated claims and hype on the Unique E website which imply theirs is the only safe and effective product to take. Carlson products are also very good, and very similar, and their labelling is better and clearer as well without use of vague terms like 'proprietary blend' which set my warning bells ringing just a bit.UPDATE: I've contacted the company that makes this and they have confirmed that yes, this product does only contain two of the four tocotrienols. So that wasn't any type of misprint and it seems this is a poor choice of tocotrienols product as it contains only 2 of the 4 types.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SHXE0TTEFTDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AQ1D04#wasThisHelpful","R2SHXE0TTEFTDY","A2C7VMN9UAYYDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C7VMN9UAYYDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book is written in a light conversational tone and much of the practical advice given is quite lightly explained as well. If you haven't read this sort of book before and you're affected by food and chemical sensitivities it could have a significant impact on you all the same, both emotional and physical.The author talks about her experiences with anaphalaxis type food allergy, and in a much more limited way, about MCSS. Despite the title and what the author says in the book this isn't really a book that focuses on primary MCSS and what she means by terms like Fibromyalgia and 'chronic fatigue' are probably different (as they often are) to how others may define them. Symptoms are not the same thing as diseases.But if you have the same type of food allergies the author does you may find her personal story interesting, and in particular her tips for minimising an allergic reaction once it's triggered and how to travel when you have very specific food and environment needs.The book provides an okay quality introduction to how leaky gut problems can be caused and how they can lead to other health issues.The author became ill after taking NSAIDs which can, and in her case did, cause leaky gut syndrome. Leaky gut syndrome can then lead to other health problems such as problems coping with foods and various chemicals, the author explains.The book discusses elimination diets, some supplements, lymphatic massage, colonics and enemas (with colonics being a far better choice), juicing, dry skin brushing, castor oil packs, digestive enzymes, Candida and dysbiosis. It also talks about the dangers of taking daily aspirin and NSAIDs.The information on treatment given in this book overlaps with that given by many others, including Dr Sherry Rogers. But this book contains only about a fifth of the information given in Dr Sherry Roger's book, it misses out so much important information. Some of the information is incorrect as well. Raw foods are actually much harder to digest than cooked ones and especially so if you are ill and have poor gut function. To see a book about allergies and MCSS that recommends such a paltry amount of vitamin C was disappointing, for example. That alone is a huge omission. Vitamin C is so essential if you have these health issues, not just a few grams but a proper bowel tolerance dose. It is essential long-term but also very helpful when you need to quickly treat yourself after eating an allergic food etc. It helps so much!Considering that this book uses Dr Rogers' books as a reference I thought it was very misleading that on the back cover it is claimed that this is the first book of its kind. That is not true and just marketing hype. The title and design of this book is pretty hypey and not great as well. I was surprised the book was as good as it was, considering the cheesy title!To learn about how to treat leaky gut and symptoms of food and chemical sensitivity I would highly recommend Detoxify or Die by Dr Sherry Rogers, which talks about detoxification, nutrition, supplementation and the use of FIR saunas for detoxification, plus her book on healing the gut as well. They are both absolutely brilliant and essential. Very good information on healing the gut is in the GAPS diet book too.These treatments work, but the better quality and more comprehensive the information you have the more successful you'll likely be. This book may be a good basic introduction but its far too light on the basics to be anyone's one book to rely on. It's worth a read though if your library has a copy, I think.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"This book explains that it's not true that we have total control over our health, but nor is it true we have no control. The truth is somewhere in the middle.The author also explains that symptoms are not small issues that should be ignored or suppressed, but warning signs that we need to change some things in our environment before these small problems become large ones. Just suppressing a symptom or ignoring it allows the disease progress to continue and to become more pronounced, it only fixes the problem in the very short term at best.Our health is not just chance it is aligned to a large extent with our habits.There is a bit of anti-dietary-fat and pro-carbs, soy and grains bias in this book that it'd have been far better without, and few actual orthomolecular recommendations, and there are a huge number of questionaires on different topics to fill out if you'd like to too.The core principles outlined in this book are just as timely today as when this book was written, even if parts of the exact advice given have changed and become outdated.

"The author of this book is Dr Roger J. Williams, author of the highly regarded 'Biochemical Individuality' book - a real health book classic. He is also the person who discovered pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). As well as being a very intelligent and compassionate writer, Dr Williams was also a good writer and this book was very easy to read and understand as well as friendly and engaging.This book says it's part of the movement to abolish nutritional illiteracy and a layman's guide to biochemical individuality.The book starts with some photographs which show very clearly what difference diet and nutrition can make to health and growth and development, using rats as an example.There is a lot of information here about biochemical individuality. It's an important concept to understand in terms of maintaining and improving health but it's also just interesting. The author talks about how our differences affect our aptitude and liking for different activities, for example.For growth and maintenance we need over 40 different nutrients and these can be grouped into vitamins, major minerals, trace minerals, amino acids and others. How much we need of each varies considerably due to biochemcial individuality. We also need higher levels of nutrients for reproduction. lack of certain nutrients in utero are why certain organs become the target organ when the body is stressed by a nutrient deficiency etc.This book is an oldie but a goodie, absolutely. Some of the information is outdated and of course the dosages listed for many nutrients are far lower than you'd see in similar books today, and so other books should be used to determine exact dosages that are customary and recognised as safe, but this book still has value. The main message of this book is just as relevant today as it was when this book was first published in 1977.Many illnesses are caused by nutrients deficiencies and so there is real hope for treatment because nutrient deficiencies can be treated. Prevention of disease is even better and easier. A junk-free diet and intelligent supplementation have enormous potential to keep us well and to improve or cure disease. Given the right materials the body is a wonderful and remarkably self-healing machine. Orthomolecular medicine works.As well as cheapie used printed versions a free digital edition is also available. Either way this book is worth a read. The main theories in this book are timeless and so important for more of us to understand.Some quotes by Dr Williams:'Normal individuals are highly distinctive with respect to their stomachs, esophagi, hearts, blood vessels, bloods, thoracic ducts, livers, pelvic colons, sinuses, breathing patterns, muscles and their system of endocrine glands. In all of these cases inborn differences are observed which are often far beyond what we see externally.'""The basic answer to the question ""Why are you an individual?"" is that your body in every detail, including your entire nervous system and your brain (thinking apparatus) is highly distinctive. You are not built like anyone else. You owe some of your individuality to the fact that you have been influenced uniquely by your environment, which is not like anyone else's. But from all that may be known about basic inborn individuality ... it seems clear that the amount of individuality we would possess if we were all born with exactly the same detailed equipment would be puny, indeed, compared with the individuality we actually possess.""'Every individual organism that has a distinctive genetic background has distinctive nutritional needs which must be met for optimal well-being.'Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

"Dress it up with a shrug and heels, or downplay the design with simple flats--this maxi dress does any occasion beautifully!  I will say right off the bat that it is long, and unless you are super tall (I'm talking 6'), you will need to throw in a hem.  Beyond that, however, I found this to be just the perfect version, for me, of a little black dress.I love the detailing here--especially the patterning on the bottom of the skirt.  It adds such depth to the dress!  The gathered waist line softens the appearance of any bumps or imperfections, and the fold over bodice with bow will enhance any cleavage. The feminine straps add to the sexy allure, whilst the dual layering of the skirt allows it to flow fluidly over the body.Highly recommended!

" 0:59 Mins I ordered this William Wang creation in rose to match a pink tourmaline ring my husband recently gifted to me.  The sparkle of this piece truly outshines and out sparkles the ring!  What really surprised me when this pendant arrived was the sheer size.  This gorgeous stone is a little over 1/2"" wide and is a statement piece that has elicited gasps from friends and family.The stone is Swarovski Crystal and in keeping with the Swarovski tradition of excellence, is faceted to capture every bit of light.  That light is reflected in prisms of sparkle that dance and provide the illusion of movevent in a way that is breathtaking.  The pink rose color is rich and deep and is enhanced by the clear stones set atop the pendant.  The setting is a polished platinum that gleams, as is the 18.5"" snake chain with 3"" extender.  I love the fact that I can adjust this to fit perfectly in the hollow of my neck.I cannot recommend this gorgeous necklace highly enough!  Wear it with jeans and a sweater or an evening gown--that's how versatile this necklace is in presentation.

"This solar spot is exactly what we needed to illuminate our American flag at night.  One of our neighbors to whom we are very close recently found out their son was being deployed to the Middle East.  They are a proud family, but mom is understandably scared to death.  We wanted to be supportive and did something we should have done years ago--erected an American flag.  We promised her to keep it illuminated every night until he comes home safely.  This spot has helped us to keep our word.Initially, we used a wired spot.  Unfortunately, the timer we had attached failed miserably, so we found ourselves out late at night to turn it on, then again early in the morning to shut it off.  When I saw this spot, I wondered if our increasingly shorter and overcast days would effect the performance, but I knew I wanted to give it a go.  I'm so glad I did.  We have had this installed for a week now, and without fail, it comes in at dusk and shuts off at dawn.  The light at night is bright and vibrant, and it brings attention to the flag in Scott's honor.Overall, highly recommended.

"I ordered this headset for those times when I'm sitting at my computer and want a comfortable listening experience with noise cancellation, as our home is constantly abuzz with activity.  I couldn't be more pleased.First, these are wired headphones, which for me means a far clearer sound than I am able to get form Bluetooth devices.  In fact, the sound from these is quite impressive at this sub $30 price point.  The bass is warm and rich whilst the treble captures the high end frequencies without the annoying tin.  I get zero distortion even when listening at what some would consider to be deafening volume (blame it on those concerts in the eighties).  The padded ear piece covers are super comfortable, even when worn for extended periods of time, and the portability factor is off the charts with the great folding design.Overall, highly recommended!

"I ordered these screen protectors to help to safeguard what was a fairly substantial purchase of my iPhone 6s.  I wanted something that would ""disappear"" upon installation and not interfere with the functionality of the touch screen. I got both!First, the protector was super easy to install with zero air bubbles.  That alone was worth it's weight in gold.  It fits perfectly and my screen continues to be super touch sensitive.  If you look closely, you can tell there is a screen protector, but it does ""disappear"" to the point that I can barely tell it's there when in use.Overall, with the guarantee from Maxboost, this is ano-brainier investment to protect your device.

"I ordered this case to give to a friend who carries a naked iPhone 6s plus.  She insists that she appreciates the look and feel of her phone too much to add a bulky case.  As she is also a klutz, I feared for the little device's safety.The day she received this, she reluctantly installed it and was pleasantly surprised to find that it fit and felt great!  All buttons, ports and both cams were easily accessible via the accurately placed cut outs, and the clear back allowed the natural ""beauty"" of her phone to shine through.  After three days, however, the green bumper edge began to turn colors a bit and appeared a tad faded.  Maybe it has to do with the oils on her hands, the moisturizer she uses, or just from tossing it into her purse, but after two weeks even I agreed it just looked bad.Overall, a great case, but with the uncertainty as to the origin of the color change, I knocked off one star.

"I love this case!  I am one of those women who carries a purse the size of small luggage.  As such, I can never find what I need without a flashlight to accompany me on my foray into the bottomless depths of my bag.  This case has changed all that!In lieu of a purse, I decided to try carrying only the essentials via this case.  I loaded up my debit and a few credit cards, my drivers license, a little cash and my phone.  Surprise, surprise--it was liberating!  Each card was easy to access, my drivers license was at the ready and I didn't need to dig for cash at the register.  In addition to that, no one had to leave a message whilst I struggled to free my phone from my bag.The case itself is aesthetically pleasing, offers my phone great protection and is well-made for durability.  All cut outs are accurately placed, meaning easy access to all the buttons, inputs and both front and rear cams.  The closure holds the case securely shut, so I know my items are all safely nestled within.Overall, a great little case!

"Great case for my iPhone 6s. I love that it's lightweight, yet provides minimal protection, especially around the corners.  The bumpers do offer absorption on impact, which I discovered after my phone went crashing to a concrete floor. The finish is a nice matte that allows for an easy grasp that discourages any slippage, and all buttons, ports and both front and rear cams are easily accessible.

"These lights are beautiful!  I love to decorate our landscaping and porch with anything that illuminates at night.  I think the effect is just stunning, and I spend a lot of time finding just the perfect lights for each area.  When I saw these, I knew I wanted to place them on our wishing well--the color shown was exactly what I needed, so I hoped they were true to the listing.  When they arrived, I was thrilled to find that the purple is even more vibrant and soft than shown.I strung these the same day I received them.  It was after eleven AM, and it was pretty overcast, so I didn't expect much the first night.  Imagine my surprise when, at dusk, the strand came on--and it was stunning!  The strand produced a soft glow that was magical!  The little flowers glowed until we went to bed some three hours later.  They were off in the morning, but each evening, despite the weather conditions, we are treated to a lovely glow of light that even the neighbors love.  We have had them up for over a week now with zero issues.  Should they become faulty, I will update this review.

"These gloves are simply amazing.  I purchased two pairs--one for my husband and one for me, and we couldn't be happier.  I left this review for the other pair, but it bears repeating! These beekeeper gloves are the only gloves we will ever own for handling our lizards!  We own several Chinese Water Dragons and a particularly obstinate iguana.  When we mentioned to our pet store that they were becoming more difficult to handle, and showed the scars on my husband's lower arms from our Iggy's whipping tail, they suggested apiary gloves for protection.  This pair has proven to be perfect!First, the gloves are pliable enough to allow for a firm grasp, which is critical if you want to maintain a captive audience. We are able to lift Iggy from his enclosure and move him to a safe location while we clean and rearrange his furniture.  ;). The long heavy cuffs have deflected a number of razor sharp tail whips thus far, and the old wounds are finally healing.Overall, highly recommended protective gloves for beekeeping, lizard handling, or even gardening.

" 0:51 Mins This two in one grinder has changed the way my family feels about my cooking!  I should start by admitting that I was a late bloomer when it comes to the kitchen.  It wasn't until I was in my 40s that I discovered that I actually enjoyed cooking.  Unfortunately, my new hobby didn't always translate into something edible.  My family's biggest complaint was that the food was bland.When I discovered this gadget, I went out in search of the types of salt and pepper to grind.  Wow, was I surprised to discover that there was a world beyond table salt!  Since my initial shopping trip, I've added a half dozen grinders to my kitchen for pink sea salt, fleur de sel, coarse salt, etc.  I've also added black, green and pink peppercorns to my repertoire, much to my family's delight.  Of all the grinders I now own, however, my two Nuvita electric grinders are by far the fastest, easiest way to get the perfect grind every time.The grinder is a two in one product, as it houses two spices (usually a salt and pepper).  The compartments are easily filled via small plastic ""buckets"" that emerge from the sides of the grinder when the ridge-edged dial is turned.  Once filled, a press of a button produces a customized grind that adds flavor and excitement to any dish.Overall, highly recommended.  Add six AAA batteries, and you will never use shakers again.

" 1:29 Mins This isn't your ordinary water bottle.  In fact, this is one of the smartest water bottles I've ever seen.  Not only does it maintain temperatures for hours, it has a display to let you know exactly hot warm or cold the contents are at any given time.The bottle first and foremost is SAFE--free of BPA or phthalates that can leech into your food or drink.  If you aren't familiar with BPA, it's time to do a little research on the dangers.  I love that this seller has pointed out that this cup is food-grade quality stainless steel, as it just makes me more confident in the product.The cup comes in three pieces--the stainless steel lined cup, an infuser cup and the lid.  The infuser is generously sized for any fruits or herbs you may wish to add and can be removed in a snap.  The lid is the real star here, however, as with a simple touch, it displays the temperature of the contents. My single complaint is also my British husband's favorite part of this cup--the temps are displayed only in Celsius.  As such, learning to convert was, for me, a bit of a learning curve.  With that said, I love knowing that at lunch time, the soup I packed is still warm enough to be safe for consumption.Overall, brilliant idea brought to life in a most beautiful way.  It's leak proof, eerily accurate and insulated to maintain inside temps for hours.  For both form and function, this one is a winner!

" 1:04 Mins This micro-copter drone by Top Race is a little high flyer you don't want to miss.  At less than 2"", this amazing rolling quad goes higher, faster and further than many twice its size.The copter comes packaged with not only the remote, but also extra propellers, large side wheels that can be removed and a protective cage for new pilots.  If you get nothing else from this review, hear this:  use the cage.  The components on this drone are tiny and difficult to find should they release on impact.  The wheels and cage will protect the device and keep it intact.The remote is, admittedly, a learning curve, but if you're an experienced droner, it should be a cakewalk.  It's super sensitive, so the copter climbs very quickly and can get away from you if you're not on top of it.  I was amazed at how much height we were able to get and maintain whilst hovering.  It's difficult to capture this on video, as the size is prohibitive, but I've attached a few brief flying clips to give you some idea of the speed.Honestly, you will not be disappointed in the performance!

" 1:00 Mins This Burei watch embodies all that is Burei--incredible quality, sophisticated styling and flawless function.First, the quality of this timepiece is beyond reproach.  The stainless steel construction, coupled with the impressive quartz movement, make the watch durable and fashionable.  It is shock and scratch resistant as well as waterproof to 99 ft., meaning it will go from office to the gym without missing a beat.The sophisticated, professional styling is simply stunning.  A high gloss black face is at the foundation of this watch, which features three strategically place chronograph subdials.  A sweeping second hand, prominent day and date panel and and a double easy-open clasp are just a few of the features my husband LOVES.  He has been wearing the piece for a week, from working in the yard to his suit-and-tie day job, and it has yet to show a single scratch or sign of wear.  It has also kept perfect time, never losing a minute.Included in the beautifully packaged presentation of the watch (gift bag, clamshell box, pillow display,etc.), is a link removal tool that saves the jeweler fee for sizing.Overall, a gorgeous wrist watch that is well-made, stylish and works flawlessly.

"This set of colored pencils has one of the most extensive color selections I have ever seen!  From pale pink to vibrant orange to matte black, it would be a challenge to seek a shade that isn't included.These pencils come housed in what at first appears to be a convenient carrying case.  In reality, however, the case is most INconvenient, as it must be fully opened to access the pencils.  When it's fully opened, every pencil is exposed, and it's very difficult to manage to keep them in their ""indentations"" in the case.  Reclosing the case is difficult at best.  With that said, don't let that deter you from purchasing, as the pencils are truly the star of this show.Each vibrant piece comes presharpened and ready to use.  When the lead wears, however, they sharpen evenly.  The colors are not only bold, they appear opaque on the page and glide easily.  They are great for both filling and outlining as well.Overall, highly recommended set that will keep you awash in beautiful color!

"This Bombex Temptation vibrator is one powerful package!  With just under a 5"" insertion length, and a girth that appears a tad thin, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from this device. I installed the batteries, turned it on and was wowed!First, the features of this jelly rabbit are myriad, and each adds to the experience.  The shaft and head are molded and shaped with great care, with details added to mimic the real deal.  There are spinning metal balls in the shaft and the interior of the tip rotates, each via controls at the base that are easily accessed and can be used to adjust the speed.  A second motor for the clit stimulator has its own control, again easily accessed, responsive and intuitive.  That clit stim has an overall flat edge with small raised bumps that simulates the sensation of a tongue and is guaranteed to bring even the most hesitant to orgasm in short shrift.  I love that it's latex free and is easily wiped clean.Perfect for water sports, bedtime fun or a little lunch break stimulation!  Highly recommended.

" 1:21 Mins Anyone who thinks that pink is just for spring is missing out on the opportunity to brighten up EVERY season. For me, pink is a year round staple, and this handbag will make the rounds come spring, summer, fall or winter.The exterior of the bag boasts a gorgeous soft pink faux leather with a surprisingly realistic grain.  The matching handles are rolled and stitched, and the base of the bag features four studded brad feet.

"Once again, SoundLogic has proven that it deserves its current membership in the pack of top dogs producing quality audio devices.  Everything I've ever purchased that was SoundLogic badged and branded has been of the highest caliber, and this little speaker is no exception.  If the budget-friendly price point has you questioning the quality or sound, think again. It's durable, aesthetically pleasing and sounds great, even wowing serious audiophiles.The design of this device is so simple.  It is mounted upon a large suction cup,which allows the device to adhere to any smooth surface--and it stays put! The speaker itself is atop the suction cup and below a rudimentary press-to-activate control panel.  The panel is covered with a waterproof silicone that is effective and responsive and boasts volume control, track management and phone answering capabilities.SoundLogic Bluetooth devices are a breeze to pair, and so it was with this speaker.  Immediately upon powering up, it was recognized by my iPhone 6s and paired with no necessary configuration,  it just couldn't be any easier.  The speaker is also rechargeable via the included charging cable, so no searching for batteries--EVER!I was surprised at the boss sound that wailed from this little unit.  The bass is rich and deep, whilst the high end revealed every note in the range without that tinny echo that is so prevalent amongst small Bluetooth speakers today.  The icing on the cake here is that I can even answer my phone from this speaker with just the press of a button, meaning I'll never miss a call whilst I'm in the shower ever again.Overall, a quality speaker manufactured by a top-notch company and brought to market by a reputable seller.

"This smart charger holds a coveted spot on my nightstand where it has become intimately involved with not only my iPad Air 2 (the hussy), but also my leather wrapped Kindle Voyage and my jewel draped iPhone 6s.  It's quite the party, though all participants remain cool to the touch no matter the time they spend together.This crafty device has all the right moves. He charges quickly, and intuitively determines the needed current output for whatever device(s) to which he is immediately connected.  On occasion, he's even entertained my husband's Galaxy S5 and never missed a beat, keeping as many as four devices entertained, charged and on alert simultaneously. His four (FOUR) inputs are always ready for a new connection, and I've never known him to participate in a USB hookup that wasn't wildly successful.Overall, he's a great addition to my gadget collection.

"When I saw this tshirt, I knew it was a must have for my fourteen year old daughter.  I find it incredible that the Jaws saga was from my generation and yet lives on and is recognizable by kids today some forty years later.  FORTY YEARS!  The fact that items such as this are still being produced is a testament to the mass appeal of the movie as well as the genre.  Without Jaws, there would be no Sharknado, and how had would that be?  Ok, not THAT sad.The shirt itself is a cotton blend, soft and durable.  It washed well, though I did wash it inside out and placed it on a hanger to dry.  The design suffered no peeling, fading or cracking in the process, and the black fabric did not fade, shrink or lose its shape. It is true to size and definitely gets noticed.Overall, great design in a quality shirt.  Note that I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.

"Tried this and the BARMIX. This one is PERFECT. The other one was horrible. Why? When you use it on cheese blocks like Gouda this one cut the perfect slices. The barmix one was way too thick and would bend. The kids could not use that one, so it goes into the forgotten tools drawer. The Linden is truly a great slicer. Even slices and not too thick and not too thin. It is flexible but does not bend and very very sharp so even at the end of a cheese block you can slice it to the last edible cheese layer.

"Background you can skipIncluding this fuel belt I have 3 in total. The reason I decided to add this one to my collection was that the previous hydration belts had smaller bottles (6 and 8oz) and I liked the fact that this one came with 2 extra bottles and a -somewhat gimmicky- arm band that flashes.In short, the price and all the extras swayed me, combined with all these 5 star reviews... My other belts cost me 40$ plus so I was happy to find a 5 star item at this price. I'm an intermediate runner,  in peak season I do about 35 miles a week, weigh 185 lbs, athletic build, 7.40 min/mile is my race speed for half marathon, 45 yrs old.Well, the saying is true: you get what you pay for. As an intermediate runner I was simply surprised to see this item fail on its first run.When putting it on I noticed that the front is simple nylon/polyester as you'd find in any cheap messenger bag. It has a dual center pouch that fits a iphone 6 but not anything much larger (like my Lumia 1520). Next to that are, on each side, the bottle pockets. The back of the bottle pockets and the pouch has NO grip beads or anything else that will stop it from sliding and bouncing. Also, given that this nylon is not stretchable, the entire stretch is coming from the back strap and that is big problem number one: the tension get unevenly distributed and I got ""hot spots"" on the upper pelvis bones after my first 8 mile run. My skin was ran and it was a serious distraction during my run.Also, given that the stretchy elastic is on the back and just that piece, combined with the inside of the front section having NOTHING to keep it in place, you'll have to pull it much tighter than any of my other running belts to stay in place.Now, further about that first disastrous run: I had filled the bottles with my favorite hydration fuel and turned my first corner picking up speed and I felt weight drop. Looked down and the right bottle was gone... despite it being held in place by a loop in the top. What gives... I figured I had done something wrong. Put it back in and secured it and started running again....flop... gone again... What gives... So now I am completely out of my rhythm and annoyed that my gear is actually stopping me from my run. The problem: when the bottles are filled the poorly designed pouches do not secure them and the can slide out of the bottom. If you look at the photos carefully you'll see they saved money by using elastic bands to create a T in which you slide the bottles. Well, the bottle moves around and with the weight of liquid it flops right out.Silly me I kept on running and every 1 to 2 minutes I had to look down to adjust the bottles so they would not fall out. The solution? I emptied the bottles by half and that seemed to do the trick, but defeats their purpose.Also, did I tell you that this thing moves? It does not stay still like my other neoprene belts. No rubber or anti-slip dots on the inside and no stretch in the front section makes for a poor poor belt. A few items in the pouch like a cellphone and some fuel packs and you will feel it bounce. Tightening it tigher will make it better but you'll get chafe.The bottles: the caps are decent but the BPA free bottles have bad thread. When squeezing drink in during a run, it sprayed out from unde3r the caps. So you have to do low pressure 'suck'. Not cool either.The plastic claps / buckle on the back sticks out: I felt it the whole run.There is no bib-tie on the front.So for me, its a complete failure and am stumped at the reviews. I wanted this to be a great find but its useless because of these shortcomings. Running gear that breaks your concentration and has this many downside is developed in some sewing shop without any care or understanding of what runners need.In summaryThe good:- cheap- extrasThe bad (everything else):- bounces- nylon non stretch front that does not stay in place- leaky bottles- bottle holders that do not secure the bottles when full- bad clasp on the back that dug into lower back- you need to over tighten it to keep it from too much bounce which created chafing on my pelvic bonesShell out more and look for something that has had more serious runners review and use. You really do get what you pay for. This thing will never be wonr by me again and I feel lots better about paying 45$ for a good belt now...","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294TX3ST2HBOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HDZ6WG#wasThisHelpful","R294TX3ST2HBOR","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Background you can skipWe started on a journey of replacing the Calphalon / Cephalon / Tefal / and Stainless potts and pans that we accumulated over the years. The reason is that the non-stick stuff, over time, comes off and who knows what it really does to your body long term.The cast iron pan we received of my mother, already 35 yrs old when we received it, was an eye opener as nothing stuck in it and it was glorious to cook in. So we decided to go pan by pan and build up a full ""site"" of cast iron pots and pans.We've tried various brands, initially, thinking ""cast iron is cast iron"". WRONG. The smoothness of the surface, quality of the seasoning, fit of the lid, even thickness etc are all critical in making something GREAT cookware versus a horrible failure. Lodge has been a winner in every category of cast iron cookware for us. At this point we have a complete cookware collection and 90% is Lodge and we love it.The trick with cast iron? Read up on directions on how to cook with and hot to properly clean. Too many people ruin the seasoning by not understanding how to care for it. If the seasoning ever gets sub-par or you make a mistake: re-seasoning is very easy with any oven and some cooking oil.Here's the good:- perfect thickness of iron- deep even and eternal seasoning: we have yet to re-season any of the pans after several years of intense use- smooth cast iron surface. The combination of seasoning and smooth surface make for virtually non-stick cooking, be it crepes or sunny side up eggs. Works great!- lid of this item fits precisely- Handle on pot as well as lid: its heavy- can withstand very very high heat, unlike non-stick. Great for over use- Keeps heat very long so dinner doesn't go cold in secondsOn the downside (we're nitpicking on the first):- heavy to handle, so not great for older people. You can get a serious wrist workout from handling these- Amazon seems to have a crazy price band for this. Bought mine in the low thirty bucks and today, when writing this review, its 88. Nutty.

"I know I will be unpopular but this review reflects my personal experience with this keyboard:When it was fully functional it was as great as people claim it to be. However, when I ran into trouble and reached out for support I was thrown for a loop:- A key came of under normal use and I didnt figure it out in time and could no longer find the key. I sent a note to Anker support with a picture of the item and the missing key and asked if they could help me get my hands on a replacement key.Instead of a yes or no I received an email where they wanted proof it was theirs by seeing the USB cable with the serial. I have no idea why the serial would have been on the usb cable but since that cable was a simple micro usb cable that I have millions of I have no idea where to find it.So I sent a picture of the item with NO ipad in it so you can see the Anker branding and so on. I gave them my order number from Amazon as proof but to no avail.Seems they are heading the same route as others: avoid support at all costs.So, the one star is because I paid good money for this, it didnt last in in normal use and I cannot get support despite the promise of warranty.Anker not so good.UPDATE: Anker reached out after the review, so thats a plus. They care about public image. Instead of sending the missing key they exchanged, that was great.Still only upgraded my listing to 3-stars (ITS OKAY) because:- the bluetooth connection often drops and I have to re-attach the ipad- the keys are not that nice to type on. Mine came off on the previous one and its not a smooth click (flimsy)- it only hold the ipad in one angle with the magent and you have to use the magnet for it to activate the bluetooth. Thats not so great with video conferecning or lap use as the angle is not good for meFrankly, I liked my old Logitech keyboard better on my previous ipad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CDJG6YQLMQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QF5MXFY#wasThisHelpful","R16CDJG6YQLMQU","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Background you can skipWe got this via Vine as a test case just when we had bought the Ninja MC701 (3in1) and the InstantPot IP-DUO60. It took us about a month of use to settle on the rating for this item and it is very much driven by the price. The other items are 100 to 150 bucks more expensive but can do a lot more than just slow cooking but given the price range and being good at its single purpose we think this is a great slow cooker.About this itemThe inner pot is deep. Much deeper than that of the Ninja. It is also made from a ceramic type material rather than the obligatory Teflon type material. This matters to us as the non-stick coatings inevitably fail over time.The other notable thing about this slow cooker is its singular purpose, which is reflected in the very very basic operation of the unit. It's so simple that I can do it without wifey having to provide direction.We've used this for great Turkey chili's, morning apple oatmeal recipes and so on and they all came out gorgeous. All in all, at this price point, we think this pot is a winner due to its simple and elegant execution and use of quality materials.Pros- Deep slow cooker that is great for shops and chili's as well as the regular slow cooker stuff- ceramic pan in the unit that can be taken out- simple LED display and control- glass lid- size, unit can feed a family of 6 easily in a single prep- inner pot does not stick- a great value when looking at price vs materials used. many of the more expensive units are non-stick (bad!)Cons- Timer could have been 24hr.- Perhaps they could have added a searing option, but at this price point? No, that's nit-picking.In summaryThis is a great unit that we love using over the somewhat complicated Ninja machine for slow cooking. Its deep pan and ceramic build combined with a glass lid make for simple operation. We love it and have used this over the 3x more expensive item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQX8NQVSO69O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J8MKKS#wasThisHelpful","R2MQX8NQVSO69O","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A short review:Purchased these for motorcycling between say 65F and 40F (with an extra fleece or wool liner). I also purchased a pair via auction site for the same amount. What I didn't like about this glove the auction version had correct. Photos attached.Just a note up front: the seller advertises these as motorcycle gloves because of the ""gauntlets"", however, these are note really motorcycle gloves. They are not padded in the palms, the gauntlets are too wide so air flows in, the back of the hands are seamed and wind comes through. The fingers are not well cut: i feel the seams pressing against my finger tips and sides and I bought a size up (normally an L @ 5'10"" and 180 lbs) because I wanted to add an inner liner.Having said all that, they are soft and for short rides they are meh-OK. If you want comfortable riding gloves then ou cannot get 100$ quality for 35$. that holds true in this item.Pros:Reasonable price for deerskinRelatively soft leatherCons:Not cut very well, one glove is larger than the otherOne velcro strap is shorter than the otherCan feel seams in fingersWind comes through seams on back of my handDeerskin is not that thick compared to competing productGauntlet too wideNo paddingIn comparison:In the photos you can see gloves without the seams on the back of the hand (on the right). Those are softer and have thicker deerskin. Also, the gauntlets are narrower letting in less wind. The stitchings can not be felt in those in the finger tips and they have no need for the velcros that these Amazon gloves have (not comfortable and w=one is way short).  I also find the lining more pleasant in the auction ones. Anyways, not trying to advertise other products but merely trying to state that these aren't that AMAZING deal that the reviews make it to be . I was disappointed and find the auction ones a better deal. Plenty of options in this price range that are better made.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C07APOC4R632/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BQBCNO#wasThisHelpful","R3C07APOC4R632","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:10 Mins Background you can skipWe received this through the Amazon Vine program and that was opportune as we normally just clear away small dishwasher loads by hand and let the items drip out in the deep sink. Problem is that the kids sometimes simply run water over them and the items do not properly dry and drip out.  Some of the racks out there are open metal or plastic covered frames. What we never liked about those is that they drip straight onto the counter underneath the rack and secondly that they, always, start rusting over time (unless you get chrome or plastic covered copper but that is becoming increasingly rare given cost).About this itemI have added a 1 minute video so you can see what the actual folding capability is and what the features are of this item. Thought that might help a bit.What seemed to make sense about this design:- all plastic (and heavy plastic so it can hold weight)- thick metal frame on outside to keep it in form and properly unfolded- foldable so it uses less storage space when not in use- relatively versatile (glass, pots , plate and utensil space)- reasonably large to be meaningfulSo now that we have actually gotten to use item here is what we found in reality:Pros- the plastic is indeed heavy / durable quality so this think can stack some weight and the outside metal bars keep it feeling solid and substantial- the hinges give a positive confirm/click when opening or closing the wings (see video) and feel sturdy as well- The silicone sleeves on the feet keep it in place on the counter , however the fold out EXTRA rear feet to light the rear up and drain to the water outlet are plastic and have a little less grip. Should not be a problem when stacked with plates etc as its own weight will hold things in place- the water outlet is both a cap as well as a water channel that you can hang over the sink to drain. Quite practical- utensil baskets stay in place even packed full- foldable dish section helps when using cereal bowls and needing space for more pots etc,Cons:- cost. I think 40 bucks is steep for a dish rack. quality is good but 40 dollars .... Thats also the reason I reduced a star as I would not have bought this at that price. 30 would have been my appetite given choices out there- folding the wings in does reduce the footprint that much (see video) so I think they could think that through better- the utensil baskets can be removed so you can add 4 glasses/mugs  but the ""pins"" over which to put the glasses are not long enough to hold anything deep- the dish rack section does not hold our cereal bowls: the slits are too narrow. will work for soup dishes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5BX8YR7QMCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X6OKC#wasThisHelpful","R2P5BX8YR7QMCQ","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipMy setup at home is a mix of Mac and Windows machines for me and my kids. I am predominantly on Mac and my teenagers are Windows gamers and also use their machines for school projects. My router is an Apple Airport Extreme (tower), in case you're wondering if there are quirks with wifi setup on an apple hardware network: no problems.My main ""bulk"" printer is a Brother MFC7680, which is a black and white laser printer and fax/scanner/copier unit.This Canon Pixma MG6620 is only used for their school projects and for photo printing.About the setupIn the box you will fix a large fold out installation poster and as long as you follow the numbers you will have it setup in a breeze. I set mine up without connecting a cable and I did not use WPS either. Anyways: long story short: you remove some plastic tape on the machine, insert some supplied cartridges and go through the setup steps on the little display. Super easy and was foolproof for me. Once you print your test page and subsequently scan it you're all set. The whole setup took 15 minutes including unboxing. And the printer was also automatically visible on all my computers.What a great experience.What was not so great, and which case me to deduct a star were the following:1) The cloud printing/email printing setups were a pain. You have to print numbers, then go find a computer, go type in long (!) website addresses, setup accounts, wait for email links, reclick those and so one. What a pain. And I still don't know what it really does or how it works.2) The software I installed on my Windows machine felt like bloatware. It created all kinds of running control panel screens that appeared on startup and clogged my screen. What a pain.  The route of uninstall it went as these apps were not really great.OperationThe operation is great. The printer/scanner/copier showed on my Windows and Mac machines without a hits and I could print immediately.What is even better: I was able to scan directly from it into apps like Paperless. Very very easy.As with all ink jet printers: ink dries and can clog print nozzles. Make sure you use this regulary, by the way. If you do not it can become a real pain and unusable, is my experience but that is just inherent to ink jets.Let's face it: ink is not cheap so it is important that you find a good cheap source. I am happy to report that I have found those on Amazon. Just look for the cheap 5 star reviews. Those work great as I am on my first kit.Conclusion:Pros- Easy as pie to set up- great color print quality, especially on photo paper- efficient with ink compared to my old HP Photosmart- Scanner and copier function a plus and comes in handyCons- not-so-great software/bloatware- horrendous setup for web print services","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S51VK24O3OXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGRDK#wasThisHelpful","R3S51VK24O3OXR","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI wear a size 11.5 medium width. This always holds true for Nike, Adidas, Converse as well as Timberlands. However, when I received these I had ignored other reviews stating these ran half a size large and ordered an 11.5 thinking that a Timberland is a Timberland. I was wrong. I ended up switching them for a size 11 in both the brown as well as the black. At 11 they fit perfectly.I travel a lot for work, spending about 5 days a week away from home and therefore shoes have to:- hold up well to abuse- be comfortable to walk on- breathe well as I have them on 12 hrs a day- be able to be worn casually under jeans as well as under a suit- be easily put on and off as I go through airports- last a long time- handle rain/snow (no slipping or soaking)- be water tight or resistantAbout the Earthkeepers Zip bootI first bought this boot in black a little over a year ago while I was still on a pair of Stacy Adams in the 250$ range. The SA's finally looked too abused from winter use. They made it to about 8 months with regular airport shines and a sole replacement.I gradually started wearing these Timberlands more and more and really like the dress boots look under a suit as, standing up you can't tell they are boots, and sitting down your socks do not look as forlorn. Not for everyone, dress boots, but something I brought with b me from growing up in Europe I guess where it is much more common to wear in an office environment.When I first ordered them I was not sure they would look good as dress boots as the black was definitely of a faded kind called burnished black. And the shoes were not categorized as dress boots but as regular/casual boots.Having used them under a suit: the burnished black is definitely not a shiny black but certainly fine for use under a suit. Same for the brown. However, when I had them shined the first time at an airport (great shoe shines in Tampa :D) they took on a very shiny, polished look. There obviously are more ""dressy"" boots out there but I can safely say that after a year plus (got these in April 2013) the black ones are still in very good shape. The leather is high quality and the soles have kept up. Mind you, it has been almost DAILY on these shoes since then.Also pleased to note that they fulfilled every aspect of my wish list in the previous section. Unheard of at this price point I think.I have since bought the brown ones. More like a tan color that can go great with a gray suit or under jeans, whichever pleases you.Oh yeah, I also wear them where I sometimes go motor biking.The foot bed is very comfortable and I never bought insoles for them. They also do not make my feet sweaty as the leather breathes well. They honestly never took on foot odor or even in summer weather made my feet hot.The nicest part? They have laces that make them look like regular shoes, but the zippers on the insides are a blessing when going through security checkpoints or kicking them on or off on planes.They have honestly gotten so soft from wear and care (I treat my shoes with Obenauf's leather oil to fully water and scuff proof them and Leather Nova to condition them) that these fit like a supple glove around my feet. I truly bought another pair in brown because of the comfort and experience with these boots. The price, at this quality, is a steal.I have tried many brands, from popular cheapskates (Madden, Aldo) to medium priced (Stacy Adams, Timberlands, Ted Baker, Varvatos) to 300 dollar + shoes (Cole Haan's. Mezlan) and think the Ted Baker's and Timberlands are the best price quality you can buy.Do make sure you watch the price for these as I have seen them as low as 90 and as high as 160. It fluctuates a lot. I do know that I will probably buy another black pair to save in a box for when these finally wear out, that is how pleased I am with them.Now if Timberland could only create everlasting soles these would probably hold up for a decade.VerdictPROS: (all the things I was looking for)- superb quality for the price (18 months of daily use and still great looking and comfortable)- hold up well to abuse- comfortable to walk on- breathe well as I have them on 12 hrs a day- able to be worn casually under jeans as well as under a suit- easily put on and off as I go through airports- last a long time- handle rain/snow (no slipping or soaking)- water tight / resistant- quality zippers- thick supple real leather- Earthkeepers recycling materialsCONS (really had to think hard, nitpick)- use leather conditioner or Obenauf's (Amazon has this) on your shoes to truly waterproof them as they will soak in after a while in slush- BEWARE TO BUY 1/2 SIZE DOWN- the soles are a little rugged looking for under a suit, but in fairness not visible and these are meant as casual.- front footbed less comfortable / soft. Not a problem but rear part much softer.... told you I had to really nitpick on the cons, so in summary:** well deserved 5 stars, the price/quality is amazing value compared to competition I have tried**","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSEZZWDN9OR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VNCKSK#wasThisHelpful","R3OSEZZWDN9OR3","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some sizing comparisonSizing: I am 180lbs, 5'11"", athletic build. Jeans size 29x32, and normally wear size M for tops like this. I purchased the black one in size M and it fits slightly large. Not a problem as I would normally wear a thermal layer or base layer underneath that is a little thicker. I could have ordered a small and it would have had a better fit but the reason I did not return it is that I like the fact that I can pull the bottom part over my fitletics hydration belt in the front. Doesn't look as dorky :D that way. Also, had I used a small one I believe the sleeves might have just been a little shorter and not as comfortable for using the thumbholes to keep my hands warm. In the end I recommend, if you're my size, to go with a small instead of medium.Final comparison: all of my Adidas (my preferred brand) running jackets fit me perfect in M. This Asics simply runs of a little larger template than Adidas.About this itemThe fabric is lightweight and breathes well. It is great for use in the gym with just as sleeveless t-underneath, from my experience, not just for running outdoors.For outdoors: you can wear this casually on a jeans and it would not look bad at all. But that is not why most would buy it: I use it as a running top as it was intended. Reason I did not review it immediately (had it for a month) is that I needed the weather to get colder to test the ideal range for this item, and that happened in the last week or so. Today I ran a 13.1 at sunny 37F weather, very very light wind.  I wore a long sleeve base layer shirt and just this hoody over it. I was NEVER cold and being a heavy sweater I never became clammy and cold. So I can safely say that it adequately wicks moisture from your base layer and does not soak. I also ran earlier in the week at about 49F and this hoody was still great but I had to zip it open a little. Would have been better with a thinner, sleeveless, base layer in 50 degree weather. Higher than that I would not likely wear this. I know this is somewhat personal preference but I'd say this works great between 30 and 50F.I'd also say that the fabric is lightweight and not a great wind blocker, so in colder windy weather I'd go with a thicker weaved item.It is somewhat tailored and the hoody gives it a good look. Also, as should be the case with these jackets: your behind is partially covered as the back is a little longer than the front. The front end just above the crotch area. The fit is tailored in the waist and narrow in the arms. Very common design for a running top. There is a slight pattern in the weave that seems ""pressed"" into the fabric. And then there are reflective accents on the pockets.Also, there are no seams in bad places (e.g. I have a top that has a seam right where the nips are, and after 13 miles that stuff gets raw) and the pockets are not bunching up and are the right size for some running gloves, a phones (pocket located by heart is best for that given bounce of heavy item) and maybe some keys and fuel.The neck zipper has a fold and stays in place. The ONLY thing that bothered me at times was the hood as it would sometimes hang over a shoulder a bit and snag my headphones. I stitched in some Velcro the inside of the hood and some on top of a running can and now, when I run I can keep the hood up to cover my ears and have a visor to boot. Without Velcro and a hat it will not stay up in a run.VerdictPROS:- for under 30 bucks this is great fabric and value- airy weave that keeps you covered and cozy between 30 and 50F- wicks very well, dries fast- cool hoodie design, most are without- reflective accents are stitched on- pressed pattern gives it an expensive feel- thumbholes- plenty of pockets- good athletic and flattering cutCONS- sizing slightly on the larger size- not wind or waterproof (layer if for wind protection)- hoodie flops around too much. Should have had Velcro to stay in placeIn summary: for the price you can't go wrong. If it had been more towards 40 to 45$ I'd given it 4 stars as there are more options in that range. But for this price I have yet to find something that keeps me dry and warm enough in that fall temp range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODHNPTWJXPF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1JFVVW#wasThisHelpful","RODHNPTWJXPF0","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI selected this item for review given that my sons' martial arts school had only a little plastic box with some band aids. What better to try than an industrial size cabinet chock full of first aid items. At time of this review the pac kit 6155 was retailing for around 130 bucks, so I factored that into the review. Obviously I received it through Vine, but am reviewing as if I had purchased it in the store.About this itemThe pictures look great. Looks like a well stocked sturdy and professional set but that is just the cover. When I received the item I was pleased with the case: it is quite heavy duty and has a handle as well as wall mount holes in it. But once you open it, it becomes rather disappointing:- even though there are tons of individually packed items it is all very very low quality of unknown brands. As an example: the gauze is so think that in certain places it looks like some random threads packed together.- the tape comes in such small quantity that they can barely claim it is included- band aids do not hold well at all.- the 493 items is accomplished by stacking it full of worthless items at high quantity. Had the set been cheaper I would have understood  but in this case you are looking at something like 20c to 30c an item, not counting the cabinet, and that is really not even close.- the hardware items (scissors etc.) are throw away. They do not cut andI have stocked our own bathroom medicine cabinet (IKEA 2 shelves) chock full of items I bought individually here and on the auction site and barely spent half of what this item costs. And all brand names in high quality and quantity.- I haven't validated the items against the claims but assume it is all there, even though the photos look like there is more and better organized stuff. Not like that.PROS:- Sturdy portable and wall mount cabinet- ANSI- Decent date range on items (2 to 3 years on some)- Lots of ""stuff""CONS:- Cheap non-brand stuffing. You can buy better brand name stuff on Amazon individually for a fraction of this cost and in decent quantity- Poor hardware (scissors, tweezers etc.) is not even worth trying to use- Clearly quantity and ""marketing"" over quality and valueIn summaryYou would hardly want this case in your home or car, so it is aimed, with the ANSI statement, at a more serious environment. And for that it falls short. This is NOT something you'd want to bet someone's life on as it is not the quality material it deserves to be at 100 plus bucks.The ONLY redeeming factor was the case, but I am sure you can but a better fish box for a fraction as well. Assemble your own selection for MUCH less and with quality right here on Amazon. Nothing to like in this marketing spin.One more thing:I just went through Amazon and filled a cabinet with brand name versions (if available)  of the items in this case. In most cases this came in significantly higher quantities than what was in this case. For something in the range of 900 items instead of the roughly 450 in here you'd pay about 114 bucks, incl individual shipping. Anyways, do your math and you can make up your own mind.

The inner compression short is not the shiny polyester material but feel more like a ""harder"" blend of coolmax.On the red shorts the inner short is grey, in case that matters to you.Whats works:- inner compression short wicks moisture VERY well- inner short doen not ride up and has no seams- outer short is just long enough to look stylish and hides the inner compression short completely which I like- has pockets, in case you ever want to wear these casually but the pocket material and seams do not interfere or become noticeable while running- price / quality: this is as good as it getsAny complaints?- the compression short could have been tighter but is good enough. You can go a size smaller but would not risk that given overall fit.- the outer short does not wick as well as some other shorts I have- the waist could have been made as a flat seamless waist (but not really a problem)Not entirely fair to duck a point for that given the excellent price point, but also not perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYE9P0JB7318/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPNVYGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1AYE9P0JB7318","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the build of this item seems very sturdy and on par with the Anker items (perhaps all using the same source manufacturer?) I am not too pleased with the actual quality of this item:- This is the second USB 10-port hub I bought of this brand. The first one died a sudden death after a few months of use. Simply wouldn't power up anymore.- This second one has 4 of the 10-ports not powering up or even registering plugged in devices out of the box.So I no longer consider it luck of the draw: 2 out of 2 within months is bad odds.A few other things to note:- the USB 3.0 cord is somewhat short, s if you have your PC under the desk and want to route a cord up it might be tight.= the USB ports themselves have varying fits.

"Will keep it short as I am irate at this point and don't want to spoil your mood:When this coffee maker works its fine. However, we seriously doubt the quality controls at Hamilton Beach and more so, we detest their lack of customer centric support.The first one died within 6 months. First the timer stopped working. Then the power button stopped working.We didn't check the warranty and figured it was just bad luck and we went out and bought another via Amazon.3 months later this one died. It simply wouldn't switch on anymore.This time we checked the warranty and figured we could call them to get a new one.Here is the trick with that: they make it really hard to get a new one. Kinda like insurance companies putting in fine print to ensure there is no payout. That, by itself, should be a deterrent for buying.They make you try and read the melted/ stamped bottom and that is sheer impossible. I could not read it to the rep and even sent a 13mp photo to them to read for themselves which they couldn't. When I finally offered to hold a current news paper next to it with a sign reading"" it's really me"" the rep gave in and asked me to take photo's of the plug cut from the cord and email it to them.HOWEVER, BEFORE THEY DID THAT THEY ASKED ME TO PAY 11$. That is where they go dirty: regardless of whether they send the item they keep the 11$. So if they then come back and say your photos are rejected, you are still SOL and need to file a creditcard claim which they will win due to the fine print stating you are paying them 11$ for the sheer awesomeness of getting their support on the phone.Anyhow, fast forward 2 weeks: no response anymore to any of the emails with the case number and the photos. They simply went on mute. Absolutely ridiculous, Hamilton Beeatch.Ipso FactoSo here is what I recommend: it's a good coffee maker when it works but myluck was suspiciously short lived x 2. And when you need their client service, despite warranty, they will make it heart attack level tough to get that replacement. So DO NOT buy this online, but rather in a store that offers the 10 or 15$ 2 year no questions replacement. You will get the value out of that as this thing is possibly going to fail and you can avoid dealing with HB-BS.Good luck.We moved on to a Presto 02811 and due to its simplicity we love that, HB lost a customer and we don't care. Hope we warned you sufficiently as companies that treat customers like suspects in a line up and then hit the ignore button deserve no ones' business.PS: yeah, I do dislike them this much, given their utter lack of customer care let alone service. It should be called the HB Customers we-don't-care plan.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B94VYM3SRE59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041A5H5S#wasThisHelpful","R2B94VYM3SRE59","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipSomehow I forgot how my mom used to cook and what she used to cook with and got caught up in the hype of teflon and stone coated flimsy ware pots and pans. None of those coatings lasted or came with so many instructions hidden in the manuals (how many people realize that non-stick pans should not used above low-medium heat, or not to use Pam on them?) that we ended up retiring those (300$ and up) sets within 2 years after buying.We them progressed to stainless steel high end French cookware, Problem was that everything stuck to that and they became unsightly quickly. So that 550$ set went the way of the salvation army.Then my mom gave us this magical big black 40 year old cast iron pot that she had used to cook for the family. And to our surprise, when simmering meat or evening abusing it to make pan cakes: nothing stuck to it. This became our defacto ACME pot for everything.Fast forward: since we wanted a complete kitchen and love cooking, we started adding to the cast iron cook ware. Most of the items we bought on Amazon from the American made Lodge brand and we LOVE LOVE LOVE those. Whether its the pizza plate, the wok or skillets or the grill or larger cook pots.HOWEVER, we could not find a Lodge made soup pot that was narrow and deep like this one and based  on the photo we decided to order. Based on some unused credits we had on another website we strayed and bought it there. Price on Amazon is the best out there at time of writing this but with my credit it made sense to buy there.About the itemI know that people think that all cast iron is alike and I don't believe that. The finish of the pot is notably rougher on the surface than anything Lodge that we own. Lodge items tend to feel very smooth, with is a sign of better/purer raw material and manufacturing.Also noted that the lid and the pot don't seem to fully close. This is a problem when getting things to a boil: a properly closing lid will get things to a boil much faster.Regarding the seasoning: it definitely is not the same quality seasoning of the Lodge item and I think there is a problem with the metal in general bleeding into food. Others have reported on this an we have found it to be true. We re-seasoned the pot in the oven on top heat which surely removes any residue that can ""melt"" and still that patina didn't seem right.More so, when putting water in or even chicken stock it continues to discolor the water.My personal assessment is that the iron is less pure and more porous than that of the Lodge items. The Lodge ones are smooth and deep black or very very dark grey turning into black with continuous use. This Bayou product also still makes even onions or roux stick at the bottom of the pot. I think you get the overall picture: this pot is probably OK for the occasional outdoor fire pit party but I certainly resist using it in the kitchen given the low quality and questionable discoloring that we experience.In summaryGOOD:- Cheap, cheap cheap for a baseline pot (but what is cheap if you cannot use it...) compared to brands like Lodge- No one else seems to have a soup pot shapes cast iron potBAD:- Rough finish- Poorly fitting lid- Poor seasoning- continues to discolor food despite re-seasoning- seems lighter than equivalent Lodge type items- Made in China, sorry, I prefer job creation in the US and I prefer quality controls.In the end, we stopped using this pot and are waiting for Lodge to hear our cry for a soup pot made in America.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNE0IKUYRU1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VXKJSY#wasThisHelpful","R3GNE0IKUYRU1Y","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe started using Oxiclean when it first took the market by storm (remember those infomercials?) and wow, did that stuff work. Over the years it seems that the makers of Oxiclean have chosen to ""water down"" their formula and make it less pure. Somewhere along the way, they lost us as a client as we went on to other oxygen cleaners that still seemed to have that Ooomph in their products.This was about 5 or 6 years ago and recently we received a small bucket via Amazon to test and review.I had a batch of white T-Shirts that are made of modal and that I love wearing as under shirts and I had yet to bleach them back to pure white as they are yellowish gray tinged because of well-water and use. So I thought this not-so-harsh product could be put to the test.About our experienceIt was a bit of an anti climax: the first time I washed the batch of shorts with it they came out the exact same. Not a shade brighter.However, i had just used the recommended dose and added it to the drum of our front load HE GE washer.So we decided to try again, but this time using the ""revive whites"" instructions and we dissolved the powder and pre-soaked the t-shirts. We then washed with another load of the powder. I mean, serious powder usage at this point... and this stuff is not cheap.When the T-shirts were dry  they were still the off color yellowish gray. Could not see a difference on the modal shirts at all (and they used to be truly white). When I wore the shirts they felt itchy to me and I think my skin simply does not react well to OC, or its perfume.Frankly, the smell they added is less than wow and hard to ignore but perhaps because we used so much of it.Personally, I would think they should shun scenting it and focus on its basic oxygen cleaning power instead.At this point I was a bit frustrated and decided to re-wash with some bleach and that did the trick: the shirts brightened. I did make sure to rinse them extra long to get the chemicals out. Now I do not want to wash with tough chemicals but Oxiclean is certainly not the same quality that it was when they first launched so they will have to figure out to get back to that old recipe.I believe it cleans like a laundry detergent but it down not have that wow factor anymore.About the ingredients: even though they write that there is no harsh chlorine in it, they have one side completely filled with warnings about harsh chemicals that can burn skin and eyes. I did have slightly irritated skin from it but that is partly because it wasn't perhaps properly rinsed out or maybe the scenting they used.Verdict:For the price I could not warrant buying it as it didm;t seem to work. It seemed overly scented and lightly irritated my skin. I would have loved a non-harsh whitening detergent other than bleach but this one is far less potent and doesn't seem to be that harmless either.Not for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKW590SOEQEEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA9QS9K#wasThisHelpful","RKW590SOEQEEA","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:41 MinsAbout ZeroLemonI first used the Zerolemon brand when I needed extra batteries for my old Optimus LG Pro. They offered 2 batteries with a charger and a great warranty. The quality was great and I made a mental note of the company if I ever needed batteries again.Since then I upgraded (if you can call it that) to the Nexus 5. So when I noticed that I could not simply swap out batteries given the fixed cover I was aiming for a battery case to accompany me on business trips. I shied away from all the other brands because, frankly, they looked like they were over priced and not that well rated.When I saw ZeroLemon was planning to come out with this case on March 10th I decided to wait for it and I am glad I did.About this case, or should I say casesI didn't realize that this case was as big as it was. I should have figured it out knowing that it was a 3500mah battery that somehow fitted around the small footprint of the Nexus 5. Don't get me wrong: its not a problem. Not even for my 5'5"" wife: you can hold the phone just fine but it is certainly a little deeper and wider than you might expect.I decided to do a video where I unpack and pack the phone into the case. It might look difficult but it really isn't once you figure out you are looking a 3 cases:-There is an inner case that consists of a screen protector (thanks!!!) that clicks onto a back. That back has the opening for the battery and the bridge between the battery and the Nexus 5.-Then there is a rubber housing around that: if you drop your phone it won't mind anymore.-And finally, there is a belt clip (pretty big!!!!) that you can click the whole thing into. When it arrives its all clicked together and looks big, but don't worry.Now that I have the phone in it I am fine with it. It still fits in my jacket or inner pocket of my suit and frankly, I find it easier to hold the Nexus with this on.Operation:All the ports and buttons are accessible behind covers. The buttons work better with the cover than without for the nexus as they are more distinctly pronounced.The ONLY problem I noticed is obviously when  you use Qi charging: it does not work for that. Perhaps a next generation of this cover. But I decided it was more important to be able to travel with my phone without worry of power shortages versus NOT having to stick a cable in (that extra second of work is not that big of a deal in hindsight).The protector, even though my phone was already covered with one, works great. No swiping or touch issues.The camera, given the thickness of the case, sits quite deep, but I have not had any issues with photos and flashing: it does not seems to affect it or cast any type of shadow.On the back there is an ON/OFF button where you can decide to charge, which works fine. Ot will show LED's when charging or discharging. Problem I had is that only 3 of the 4 leds worked. It did not hinder operation so I decided not to return. Do note that if I wanted to, ZL would have replaced it. Not sure who would have had to pay for shipping given that it had a manufacturing defect rather than a breakdown at my home. I emailed them on topic just to see what they would say. I will put that in the comments later. IF they think I should pay for return shipping then you will see me deduct a start from this review.Summary:Pros- Protects your phone and then some- Battery lasts through massive video watching and surfing. I can now charge once every 2 days or so.- Provides great grip- Buttons work well- Comes with a built in screen protector- even if you skinned (my Nexus had leatherskin on AND a screen protector) it still fits well.- Has a belt clip with itCons- Might be bigger than the photos suggest- The charging port was a bit tight- Doesn't work with Qi chargersHope the video gives you a view of how it clicks together.UPDATE:Regarding the 3 blinking LED's instead of 4: that turns out to be just an oddity of how the charging works. once the battery fills up more the 4th light goes on. So even if you think, like i did, that the 4th led didn't work, it's actually working when fully charged. All is good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYSOGARQ5TAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMOCZOA#wasThisHelpful","RCYSOGARQ5TAQ","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:28 MinsBackground you can skipI opted for a video review to make you hear the ""power"" difference with like-kind corded clippers that I normally use compared to the Norelco ones.My experience with Philips/Norelco personal grooming / hygiene has been polarized: the Philips Sonicare stuff has been great but the co-branded Norelco battery powered items never lasted that long.This particular item is just OK compared to the much cheaper Wahl:http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-79300-400-Color-Complete-Haircutting/dp/B000JNQSIQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1395347844&sr=8-2&keywords=wahl+clippersThe reason I am comparing the 2 is that A: the cheap Wahls have served me for over 2 years now and  B: cordless isn't that important a feature on clippers UNLESS they have the power to keep up with corded items.You do not necessarily trim your hair every day , frankly I don't even trim weekly (incl. my beard) and batteries like this tend to lose their charge over time. So when you are ready to use them I found myself plugging in the item into the wall.About this itemMy main gripes that are keeping it from my LOVE IT 5 starts:- The blades are not adjustable, only the plastic head is: for short beard trimming this is useless- When I did force it through a beard trim: the blades snagged my hair a few times. Painful and my adjustable Wahl (see video) has none of that- the clippers work somewhat OK with the trim head on, but for precision trims (around the ears) the naked blades pouch away my thin hair and it really doesn't work well. Its almost as if the blade distance is too narrow or so. Others have said the same thing.- It lacks power which you can feel when trimming, compared to a true electric clipper. No comparison, even when plugged in.- It's too expensive for the plastic you get. It's not even thicker plastic.- If your hands are wet, or the bathroom is misty then the buttons are slippery. Its hard to switch on. Maybe my item is just defective but the button requires some force as does the trim head dial.- The trim head is too big and bulky. Makes it harder to precision trim.What I liked:- It is lightweight- If you're into cordless: it is but remember, it doesn't hold charge that well over time.PS: sorry for the accent in my video. I try!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IRO53Q948THC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOBPDBK#wasThisHelpful","R2IRO53Q948THC","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI have mainly used the Garmin )Forerunner) series of sports GPS watches in the past and decided it was ready to upgrade given the size of the Garmins.Naturally I was overwhelmed with the sheer offering of alternatives in the market and the similarities between specs and the large divergence in pricing.Having great success with the TomTom brand in general for other equipment and knowing that they powered the Nike offering I decided to hone in on the Multi-sport and Runner watches they offered:- they looked smaller than most- had convertible bands for men and women (wife uses it too)- advertised features that others didn't have like the ""race yourself"" feature where you run against your own best time and position on a previously run track- it was affordable- I loved the upgradeability they claimed (more on that later)- I loved the implementation of the joystickWhat made me worried were the 1m2 and 3 star reviews. I studied those closely and do want to note the following pattern: most of those reviews are based on VERY early adopters. Back in Mid 2013. The software was still on its beta and many functions, though advertised, weren't there. I myself purchased the first GPS Runner watch in August of so and croaked on the fact that the ""race yourself"" function was not ready yet even though they advertised it.I blame these depressed reviews on the go-to-market strategy of TomTom with this device. They wanted it out there for the summer 2013 season but weren't fully baked yet with software. This is what annoyed the early adopters and caused the review impact.But what is also notable of those reviews: TomTom replied to most if not all. Not a canned response, but with actual timelines, apologies and solutions. THAT is worthy of TomTom and made me stick it through. Now, about 6 or 7 months later: I am a convert. Best GPS watch I can imagine. It does everything and then some and they keep expanding the capabilities and software.About my experienceThe biggest thing to note is that TomTom cares about what they build: the watch has been constantly upgraded since I have purchased it (I was an early adopter when it just hit the market). I can not only race myself, race against pre-set goals, I can also start racing others via software linkage. They recently (v 1.6) introduced DIRECT syncing with IOS devices and the Android roll out is coming soon: you can disconnect the USB cables and sync over bluetooth 4.0.What's so cool about this is that this device is almost a year in since its 2013 launch and they are adding features that others would create new models and price-hikes for. This si what I think is the greatest testament to TomTom's mind set. You can obviously tell I have gotten somewhat attached to them but it is because they have treated us right from a consumer perspective.A great example of this is with earlier firmware: it was easy to accidentally stop a run because the joystick was hit inadvertently. They listened and implemented a pause into the button that required a continuous press of a second or 2 before it would record as a stop. That's a great response to a fair complaint.The watch, hence the Multi-sport title, is basically Swim, Run and Bike ready. You can buy the heart rate strap, cadence sensor and be set for Tri-workouts. Note that they need to add a few training lap calks and analytics and this thing is a magnificent deal.It also accurately measures my treadmill runs based on the built in 'accelerometer/step counter"" or like kind ability. And it is actually within 2%  accurate with a 5 mile run on my treadmill and it can be fine tuned after every race. Why is this important: harsh winter in Chicago anyone? I could not run outside for 4 months almost. This way I have accurately kept tabs on my total distance and improvements.The software is also constantly expanding and they are doing a lot to integrate with MVP (MapMyFitness) and like kind services and the item also comes with many built in export formats of your data.  I like the combo of the dashboard of TomTom and the MapMyFitness aka MapMyRun as it shows your progress analytics and can even show you a flyover via a google maps plugin of a scenic route you ran (or any run outside). I just did a run through the ""Strabrechtse Heide"" in the Netherlands while on a trip which was absolutely stunning and I could see a Google maps flyover with milestones etc in picture and map view. Very cool.It connects to satellites REALLY FAST. About this Holland run: it took a few minutes (about 2) to find its location given that I had moved continents but it did so. The next day it took less than 10 secs to be ready to run. Nothing compares in this price range (up to 225$ range I looked at). This speed is often cited by others as key. Nothing worse to tell your running busses to wait for the watch.The interface: its great to have the joystick as my hands get sweaty and I want to operate the watch (different views during run, watch for stats etc) while moving. The joystick as the main control is great and possibly kept the watch small. Great implementation of an idea that was obviously thought through by runners at TomTom I would think.Also, no one really talks about this, but the tactile (bussing) feedback when using the menus is very clever. When I hit a milestone, fall behind in a race, accidentally trip a button I can feel it on my wrist.The screen is lit when needed (when you tough or tap it) and legible in full sun (Kindle like paper lcd) and there are many stats and views you can use during runs. Too many to name.VerdictPros:- TomTom listens and does not abandon hardware. They have been unbelievable in upgrading and improving and listening to customers. Amazing, really- Price for what you get is a bargain compared to others- Great contra mechanism with joystick- You can change straps- Syncs with phone / iPad (android in works, IOS is ups an running)- You can race against targets that are pre-set but also against yourself- tactile feedback- works in treadmill- fast satellite tracking- great integrated software- small size. I sometimes forget its on after a run.Cons:- you cannot setup multiple profiles in a watch. I.e. you cannot have one watch that is used by more than 1 person as only 1 profile can be setup. This is a software/firmware issue and could be in a future upgradeI highly recommend this watch. It beats every Garmin I ever owned and certainly the Nikes and other entry levels. Read up on the specs and ability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DMB26C0FBWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW2LDL8#wasThisHelpful","R19DMB26C0FBWN","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have previously bought the 1st generation of the Jot Touch (the pressure sensitive high end sibling of this non-pressure sensitive device) and liked it... to a certain extent. I write fast and furious, draw a lot in my line of business and needed something that could replace the scores of note pads that I devour so I initially set out to buy the Jot Touch last year.I never really liked it as much as the online pro reviewers gave it credit for. The software was sometimes fickle in recognizing the pressure accurately (big fat globs of virtual ink on the screen..)  and finally it died altogether just barely out of warranty.The pen was somewhat bulky and unwieldy and there was just a that lack of accuracy that you get with a real pen. And then there was that 0.2 seconds of lag between the writing and the result on screen. I wasn't in love with it and peeved that an item that costly died so fast that I shied away from buying a new one.Then I moved on to the Galaxy Note 10.1 with some hotel points as I had heard great things about the pen use. Lo and behold: the s-pen by Samsung got it right. Truly a writing experience like on paper and pressure sensitive while still keeping the stylus small. I never looked back.However, Vine came by and showed this item as available for testing and I decided to try it out with my new iPad Air (5th gen).About the Jot Script for EvernoteSetup was easy enough and I opted for Penultimate as the app of choice.The very first thing I noted was that, when writing normally (I use a bit of pressure when I write, can't help it) the pen seems to leave marks on my iPad screen that I cannot fully get rid of when wiping down the screen. It looks like it actually affects the glass. Given that it is a narrow metal nib and with little ""give"" it seems unwise to run this without a screen protector (I don't use one).Secondly, possibly worse, is that when you write at normal speed the pen really has the same lag the old Touch had. Even the new fast iPad Air has that issue which leads me to believe its somewhere in the software or interface.Thirdly, the nib is not accurate. I cannot read my handwriting half the time due to this pen. It flattens or creates straight lines where I used curves and it makes for bad handwriting unless you write in block or are neat. I am a fast fast fast cursive writer and it does not work well.Finally, this is truly annoying: half the time there is no palm lock. not sure why but even when using Evernote's Penultimate I would all of a sudden wipe something away or get an accidental pop up etc. Just drove me mad.I wanted to try the pen for a day during meetings where I would have normally used my Galaxy Note with s-pen but after about 2 hrs of getting frustrated because  of what I outlined before I simply gave up and went with the other solution.Perhaps If I never had tried the s-pen I would be a bigger fan of this but it really doesn't feel like writing on paper where the s-pen does.In summaryThe iPad and Jot Script do not make for a good combo that truly feels like a realistic alternative to writing on paper. The biggest downsides are:- poor accuracy (my writing doesn't look like my writing)- poor software implementation (palm smudges anyone)- lag when writing- left marks on my iPadPositive:- the pen itself is well built, it's heavy, with a little led for operation and holds well in the hand.For the price the performance is VERY disappointing. Trust the (declining) Amazon rating on this one and don't hate the lower reviews on this one as we are really trying to like the item.As stated, once you try the s-pen you can compare this to something else and the s-pen is so far ahead of this there is no comparison. Samsung all the way for pen-based note taking on a tablet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3872TZTP7B2XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQEB1V4#wasThisHelpful","R3872TZTP7B2XH","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe have recently (in Sep 2013) completed 3 bathroom remodels: 1 large master bathroom for which we ordered a 60"" glass Dreamline door that had a 1"" out of plumb adjustment (NOT this review) and 2 small bathroom that had tub/shower units in them.At first we wanted to remove the relatively new tub/shower units but decided that having the small tubs in there was actually convenient. We did want to upgrade the look of those units by adding a glass door to them rather than the obligatory curtain.After some searching we decided that this Dreamline door looked right and certainly was the most affordable out there. We went with the chrome unit.  The reason we decided for this one is that it is a single door, so no complicated alignment for multiple glass panels.Given that ht stub/shower units have a perfectly plumb opening this would be a good fit.Again, there really is no out of plumb adjustment with this door so it really needs to be on perfectly square openings.The trouble was, of course, that the tub unit was made of fiberglass/plastic of some sorts and therefore would never be strong enough to carry this door on 2 hinges without cracking.Note that the door is relatively light but still, you don't want to take the risk.  We therefore ordered a flat aluminum plate the ran about 60"" and affixed it to the vertical wall, between the tub/shower wall and the hinges.We then drilled though the aluminum and used hollow-wall anchors the screw in the hinges. The hollow wall anchors were rated for 139 lbs an anchor and they affixed without a problem. The door is steady as a rock and feels like a part of the tub/shower unit itself.About the Dreamline doorInstallation: for anyone that has ever (attempted) installed a full glass shower door (door and glass panel separate) , you know that that can be quite complicated and requires some decent level of skill to make sure the panels are aligned over a wider space and securely held in place and properly sealed act.None of that with this door, from my experience. AS LONG AS you have a pretty precise 90 degree angle. It can withstand maybe 1/2"" of misalignment but really there are no other adjustments. For most installations this should be somewhat OK.Install was really simple: affix the hinges to the glass. Lay down a horizontal 5/8"" piece of wood so you get a proper gap under the door when installing, which is later sealed with the included ""weather"" strips. Note that you do need to make sure you have a strip or a few shorter 5/8"" pieces you can lay down. They do not supply them. Also do not guess, make sure you have something of the right thickness from the wood section as this need to be wide enough for the strips to properly seal.The you hold the door against the wall where it will be affixed with the hinges. Make sure the door is held level vertically as well otherwise it will open by itself towards the angle it leans towards. Again, make sure someone is there to help you level it.Then you mark the drill holes through the hinges and put the door aside and drill. Normally, if you properly install, you drill into a stud or solid wall behind tile. See comments in sidebar below.Sidebar: the gentleman that left a review that stated that everyone that rated this item well must be a conspiring criminal with Dreamline, I really don't know where he is coming from. The door is 1/4"" glass and not that heavy and these hinges are SERIOUS solid metal construction. Smaller versions of the huge hinges that hold the 3/8"" glass walls and certainly way stronger than anything you could throw at it.I get the sense the problem there is the installer. Especially the comment about not holding the door up. The hinges are supposed to be drilled into the stud behind the tile. The shower opening where a door like this is normally installed will have a stud behind it if properly built. That's what you bolt the hinges into.In case you do not have that and have tile over something like drywall: I do not recommend it but you can use VERY STRONG hollow wall anchors like I did and they can hold a ton more than this door. This door was easily carried by a 5'10 180lbs guy that has a desk job. Again, the door is not heavy.End of sidebar.Once the drill holes are there you simply bolt on the door and then remove that 5/8"" strip you had under the door. Add the door bar and some strips you slide on et voila. Door is done.About the use over timeWe have had no issues with mold as that one particular reviewer noted he had in the water strips. To me that might have to do with insufficient ventilation in the bathroom to begin with. The strips do not hold water if slid on fully,The door / shower area sees much use from guests and the kids and we have had 0 problems. The door looks great after 5 months or so of sustained use and there are no signs of rust or mold or ""out of plumb"".The one thing to note is that you obviously need to figure out what type of shower head to use as the door is only 34"" wide. I hard  and wide spraying shower head might spray beyond the door boundaries and get your floor wet. We use a rainfall shower head and have had no issues with overspray or splattering on the floor.In conclusionPros- Simple installation- Solid construction of parts- For chrome item: heavy brass parts that are chromed over. This will not rust.- Only very few parts to install- Cheapest of single glass door options we could find that is made for use with a tub- lightweight considering quality, so should be great for many if not most walls , even hollow.- Looks expensive give than it lacks rails like some of the cheaper units you find in home improvement storesCons- bring your own 5/8"" strip to install. Can be annoying if eager to install- requires perfectly plumb openingGreat item considering the cost and quality and simplicity of install!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LS1ZN2773KRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WSKGJQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LS1ZN2773KRZ","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe are heavy heavy coffee drinkers. It is frankly the ONLY thing I drink at this point. About 4 full pots a day gradually from early Am till about 6 or 7 in the evening. I guess I am a caffeine junkie and am used to that constant fidgety pressure on my body the caffeine create from the inside out. It makes me think fast and helps with focus but it does also make me fidgety and often keeps me from a good nights sleep. The problem with drinking coffee in the early evening is that it takes apparently about 4 hrs for the caffeine to get fully into your system so If you drink it at 6PM you feel the effects at full force at 9 to 10 in the evening which is right about when I go to bed.So when I saw this product and had the opportunity to get a bottle for testing I jumped on it.About the ingredient(s) of Rutacleanse:The active component in Ratuacleanse is an alkaloid called rutaecarpine.  From prublished 2011 studies on rats, apparently, 80 milligrams per kilogram of body mass in the lab rats (given each day for three days before administering with caffeine) is enough to raise two liver enzymes sufficiently to promote caffeine metabolism and subsequent excretion of the metabolite (according to an independent blogging website)However, the product contains just 100 milligrams of rutaecarpine per tablet and there are 30 in a bottle. An average adult male human weighing 80 kg (175 lbs)  and hoping to see an effect would based have to ingest 6400 milligrams of the active ingredient for three days to experience the same relative activity as was observed in the rats. That’s a couple of bottles of the stuff every day for three days before you could have a coffee.So the product works but mass quantities should be used to get some physiological effect on the liver... Lets try fact versus logic.About using RutacleanseI'm not going to re-hash the claims of the manufacturer, you can read those. Merely the perspective of a caffeine junkie.The first thing to note is that you only take 1 capsule at a time and do so once a day. It doesn't say when but states that it takes 2 to 4 hrs to reach its full effect. So for me the most logical thing to do is to take one 3 hrs before bed to get me down from that humming caffeine high.Again, it takes few hrs to get to work according to the manual, just like coffee so it's not an instant de-caffeinator that works like a switch.VerdictI did not experience a noticeable difference from using the product. If I stop drinking caffeine / coffee at 5 I can fall asleep at 9 or 10 with or without Rutacleanse. It did not make me less jittery, any less than coffee working through its effects when I stopped drinking it in time and the fact that I would have to take it 4 hrs before bed to have some effect made it ... well, kinda useless. Especially at the price its advertised for.I also think there is merit to reading the rutaecarpine research online. The quantities needed would be very large but then again, homeopathic solutions do seem to work and talk about low doses of active ingredients in there so I am not going to claim science is the only answer here.I simply state that I didn't feel a difference between stopping coffee 4 to 5 hrs before bed and falling a sleep vs stopping coffee 4 to 5 hrs before bed + taking the pill and falling a sleep. It was all the same and didnt make me less jittery or give me a better deeper sleep.Rebranded versions of this go as Rutasomn I believe, marketed as a sleep aid but with the exact same single ingredient. Again, everyone's body is different and not everyone drinks as much coffee as us German and Dutch people but I got nothing out of it so I would never spend money taking the pill...","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAF5AK5LL8LKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9JZDIU#wasThisHelpful","RAF5AK5LL8LKF","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Basckground you can skipWe wanted to replace our old and worn 50 cfm Broan 4 sones fan/light unit. This unit was installed in a slanted ceiling with NO attic access.Naturally we wanted to go fancy and install a fan/light/heater unit but when the unit arrived the electrician told us we needed to rewire to accomodate all the switches and connections and on top we'd need to upgrade the circuit from the existing 10amp to 20 amps.He then charged us a 75$ show fee and left even though he had recommended the fan.Anyways, we ton ed down our expectations and decided we wanted to just replace with something quieter, less obtrusive, more modern, more energy efficient that could also be installed easily without attic access.About this unitWell, this is probably your best bet when looking for as no-hassle retro fit with no attic access. The opening required was a quarter inch more than that of the existing small Broan unit and it came with one wide metal clamp that could easily be installed from below. with 4 screws into a ceiling beam or cross stud. The housing, once the duct is connected and the wires are connected then simply slides in with a satisfying click.I then was able to connect the VERY simple electric wires for the fan and light unit.The light and fan components then plug in.The other great thing about this retrofit is that it is very forgiving. The unit did not sit flush with the ceiling because my cross beam was way out of plumb but then i added the cap and screwed it on it pulled it fit against the ceiling.The whole ordeal took me, a novice with little electric experience other than understanding the basics, about 30 minutes.Also, this unit is very basic/modern. The light cap is almost as white as the housing trim and therefore the whole unit is not very visible until you switch it on and the bright light shines. Due to the the light cover not being transparent it has a clean look even when switched on since the bulb remains hidden.Also, it is as quiet as they promised on the box.We are very pleased with this unit as our bathroom no longer fogs up when taking that hot morning shower. Not even our glass shower doors fog up.PROS- Extremely simple retro-fit installation, even when no attic access.- Very forgiving design when it comes to out of plumb situations, slanted ceilings etc- Requires 10 amps dedicated but this is an energy star unit that requires minimal power and I did not use a dedicated circuit and have no issues.- simple wiring needs. Most homes will be able to install this unit whereas some of the newer units require expensive rewiring or over the top dedicated 20 amp circuit installs.- the unit is very quiet for this price-range. you can hear it but just a little and when the water is running you cannot hear it at all-it comes with a 100 watt equivalent bulb (13 watts) that is very bright. Nice they included that.- the light cap is not see through or semi see through so you don't see an ugly bulb, even when on.CONS- Haven't found any yet. Compared to the Broans and Panasonics and the aero Pure's this unit has superior specs and performance in the sub 60$ 70CFM, <2 sones fan/light units spectrum. Excellent choice, especially for retro fitting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBW513TDD2BWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00505VW7U#wasThisHelpful","RBW513TDD2BWX","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is advertised on Amazon as a 10 amp unit but here are the pitfalls I found once I received it:- its a 15 amp circuit requirement, which many homes and retro-fit situations cannot handle- it requires separate and distinct wiring for the heating units to get it to work with the included switches. Most retro fit situations won't have that and be prepared to shell out big $$$ to an electrician to get that remedied.- They do not disclose the wiring requirements and you won't find out until you are in an install situation what you are missing.- The lights do not perfectly fit the grille openings and the thing looks less than industrialThe good: the 15 amps it does require is for the whole thing, i.e. fan, light and heaters. So no separate circuit for the heaters only.In the end: they are wrong with the 10 amp listing and the wiring requirements are unsuitable for those of us replacing basic fan/light units. Price-wise it seems reasonable for the specs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AA42GX5158HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IH9H50#wasThisHelpful","R2AA42GX5158HJ","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is my setup: I have the Simon XT and use Frontpoint Security (alarm.com powered). Shout out to them as they are goooooood.Now on to the review, or more like: some hints and tips to make this work with the Simon XT and XTi.When I received this item I had to go and find the manual online. Just do a search for 45600 Z-WAVE and you will get a link to some PDF's. The standard PDF manual for this item is misleading and for that I deducted a star.Thankfully, reviewers like Mike left hints on Amazon pointing to the fact that it can be done. Even by the novice.I will say it a little more detailed than reviewer Mike but it is essentially his tutorial:FIRST, YOU NEED TO ADD THE REMOTE TO YOUR SIMON XT:Simon XT 1.3 or higher- At keypad: System Programming > Enter Code > Interactive Services > Z-Wave Setup > Add DeviceTHEN PUT THE REMODE IN PAIRING MODE (essentially you are following Mike's comment that you need to start at the bottom of page 11 where it says COPYING NETWORK AND/OR DEVICE INFORMATION TO THIS REMOTE):- Press and hold SETUP on the remote until the red and green light blink twice- Then on the remote enter 9 6 7The green LED's on the remote will blink twice.NOW GO BACK TO PAGE 3 OF THE MANUAL AND FOLLOW ""ADDING A LIGHT DEVICE/NODE TO YOUR REMOTE""If you do this diligently it will work. No need for complicated workarounds with scenes etc that others described elsewhere.Anyways, thanks Mike and hope my re-run helps others.For the 11 bucks I paid this little remote is worth it.Great as a panic button and get a few to keep in various rooms.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5VXCQPC4IN7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013V6RW0#wasThisHelpful","R5VXCQPC4IN7P","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this as a sunroom by our pool and looking at the photos online thought this would be neat looking at a reasonable price.Well, it's a sunroom alright but here are the negatives first:Installation:-The PDF manual is very poorly done, so look carefully and look again before you install- Some of the installation drawings were off- There are screw holes in the ceiling slats that have no part to screw in- We were missing screws in several categories and had to go out and find matching ones- The doors are incorrectly built as some youtubers noted: you cannot solve the riddle of the weatherstrip showing and our doors had the panels reversed.- The metal parts do not have precisely aligned screw holes. The while thing is slightly ""off"" and you cannot really get it fully squared. Nothing visible but nevertheless- The roof panels were squashed on some edges and were almost impossible to keep in their rails during installation- Again, biggest grief here is that nothing really perfectly lines up and you're constantly adjusting and hammering to get it fully standingAfter its up:- It's not weatherproof. With a heavy rainstorm we have roof drip and water runing down the beams so be careful what you put in. The panel structure on the roof is begging for trouble, once you see it up close: it's not built for significant water or snow backup- The wall panel are warping a bit from stress- The door has started to jam- the window panel latches are rusting and hardly open- plastic latch parts are crackingIn summary: not many redeeming factors than that it BARELY serves its purpose but be ready with lots of silicone and weatherseal to attack this thing. Others maybe have better done samples but mine was a travesty. We build lots of Palram items (carports, patio covers) and those are built precisely and the assembly is actually fun. With this thing I was ready to choke a kitteh after 8 hrs of aggravation. It takes 2 people and about a full day to do it.I think this is a 1500$ item at double the price. It's not worth the price and you're better off spending much less or some more for a better deal or decent quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFKVLHHDE81O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GGQH7O#wasThisHelpful","R1WFKVLHHDE81O","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought 2 of these and are very glad we did. They were installed on our concrete driveway which slopes a bit but the installation/design makes sure this is all square and neat looking IF you follow the instructions. These instructions are VERY clear in most parts and can be downloaded via google in case you want to have a peek.The end result looks very clean and modern and adds value to your home, whether used as a patio cover, carport or what other use.The clear polycarbonate roof lets through a lot of sunlight, so just be aware. It does keep our cars cooler than pure plazing sun. The protection from snow and rain is what we wanted and it does that quite well.A couple of findings:We did this between my wife and I. She is not handy and I am a banker... It took about 11 hrs for the first one and about 9 for the second one. So plan in a full day to get one done.Secondly: the concrete anchors are the galvanized ones: 5/16 by 3 1/2 inches. They break easily. We went and got some better ones at the depot. Dont find out too late: when the first one breaks get the high tensile ones.Here is another key piece of info: within a few weeks after building our student driver son backed into one and a pole was really bent.We called PALRAM and guess what: Tina from PALRAM sent us a new pole free of charge!!!!! I mean, seriously, I was embarrassed to accept it and was ready to pay the couple of hundred dollars that it should have costed. Her answer was: just write a review if you like us and appreciate the service. Well we do so here is that review Tina!A couple of facts / pros:Everything is high quality: even the painted parts are rust free galvanized steel parts. This thing is heavy quality.The screw holes are PRECISE. If something does not fit its because you have the part backwards or so. Precisely manufactured.The screws, nuts, bolts are high quality. Except for the concrete anchors. Those are regular ones and to do a good job I always prefer the blue high tensile ones. 25$ out of pocket for that.They look good. Everyone asks where we got them and compliments their looks. We're growing some ivy over one and boarding up one side of the other to create some accents.Follow instructions: don't tighten stuff when it says hand tighten or you will have a hard time getting the whole building square.All in all: wel spent money.ANyways, we're not that handy and did 2 of the PALRAMS in 2 days. And we had great fun doing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IAI4V7Y0IJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VLYBS8#wasThisHelpful","R16IAI4V7Y0IJZ","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some good things to say about this GPS watch that others have spelled out. I would just like to highlight why I am unhappy with this watch:- In the advertising and on the website they clearly advertise that you can race against yourself in RACE mode. This will grapically display where you were in a previous race vs the current etc.This was the SOLE reason I bought this watch. And now I am finding that you can only run against 5 presets and that the race yourself feature might come in the future.Now, I believe there is something called TRUTH IN ADVERTISING and selling something based on features that do not exist is a no no.TomTom you clwealy opted to come to market with a beta product not fully fleshed out as is evident in your wesite and that just cost you several stars for this product.Update : they finally came through and added what ws claimed in the advertising and I am hugely grateful for that.

"Background you can skipI was considering buying wither the Fitbit Aria or the Whiting WS-30 scale on Amazon and started leaning towards the Whiting given that it had a better average rating. I did like the BMI feature and the aesthetics of the Aria better and also wanted the Aria to be the choice because we have Fitibit One's, so the whole experience would be more integrated. However, as said, I did not like the fact that there were so many 1 and 2 ratings.Before I 1-clicked the Whiting I decided to read the negative reviews on the Aria and it stood out to me that they mostly revolved around setup issues and especially network connectivity. Given that I am a network tinkerer and think highly of my computer skills I decided that I would not run into those issues and decided for the Aria (hooray for logic).About the SetupThe Aria is very sleek. I bought the black one. Nice scrolling text in the window etc etc. But you can see all that from the other reviews. Also pretty clear setup instructions:You go onto your fitbit account, download some Mac or Windows software and then activate the scale by removing the plastic strip in the battery compartment.Make sure you're on wifi and the software will do the rest during install and upload the wifi settings to the scale and BAM! you're done.Not so simple.Being the self proclaimed genius I followed all instructions to the letter and sat back when the on screen prompts were telling me the settings were downloaded to the scale. Then it stopped. The scale showed WIFI ERR and my wifi connection on my Mac was off.Ipso facto: the same issues that hit other hit me and my wife came to lend me support (and to make sure I would not smash the scale against the pavement in frustration as I have a temper when it comes to bad product).After some tinkering I found the following:If you're use Wifi encryption / security the software DID NOT collect and pass my password to the network to the scale. The way I found out is that I created a guest network on my Airport Extreme router and chose NO ENCRYPTION. I figured that the Wifi Error most likely had to do with my network encryption.When I then re-ran the software and it asked me if I wanted to use my main Wifi network to connect to the router I chose NO.It them presented me with the network options of my encrypted and unencrypted guest networks.I also noticed that my main wifi network was showing a password box but it was empty. So I typed in my network password and tried again instead of using the guest network.It worked this time.So the issue is in the software and how it deals with passwords. Most likely an unencrypted network (i.e. the guest network) would also solve it but again, why add another network if the encryption settings can be added.My verdict:Minus 1 star for sh*tty setup software and messing up something basic like that. Does Fitbit NOT understand that this is the FIRST experience with the device and if it is bad then people, in this online real time world, will complain and ding you for it immediately????Shame on fitbit.However, 4 stars for when it does work: it is consistent in readings, weight as well as BMI. It also AUTO-RECOGNIZES up to 7 users of your choice and uploads to their fitbit.The screen is very legible and the integration with Fitbit is great.Little expensive for a scale but the fact that it is Wifi keeps me weighing more often which keeps me motivated and watchful of what I consume. That is work a 50$ premium to me.Hope the troubleshooting findings helped. And yes, I am not genius with this stuff but I did solve this scenario for myself !","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353XLLUJFS02M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077L8YOO#wasThisHelpful","R353XLLUJFS02M","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed some screen protectors for my Samsung Galaxy S2 D710 and tried various brands. I tried anti fingerprint/smudge and glare filters but they frankly took the life out of the screen. Somehow it looked pixellated and you could tell clearly that there was a piece of plastic over the screen.Worse, though, was that even the TINIEST speck of dust would create a bubble... I am a pro at applying wet and dry and could not get those protectors right. They were also very thicka nd hard to position.So I tried the cheapest of the bunch and it came in a packet of 3. I decided to wet-apply it and am glad I did.My findings:This screen protector is not listed as anti smudge/fingerprint but it really does not seem to smudge at all with my greasy skin.It also goes on crystal clear, i.e., you cannot tell its on. The screen looks WAY crisper than the thicker anti fingerprint protectors I used.Most importantly: it goes on bubble-free when wet-applied.Finally it does not change the sliding feel of your fingers.I simply clean the screen with some lint free clot and window cleaner.Then I spray the screen and sticky side of the protector with a light mist of solution (left over from other wet-apply kits).Then I lightly mist the surface so that the squeegee will slide smoothly.Slide and position the protector on the phone and squeegee the excess out from under it with the supplied squeegee.Again, no bubbles and invisible.Cant go wrong at this price!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSVP2955BNBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBMUBW2#wasThisHelpful","R2TSVP2955BNBD","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Background you can skipI am quite the collector of gadgets given that my kids and wide all have cellphones and uploads and laptops and so on.I have a bit of the wrap everything in plastic gene . Not my sofa but certainly all of the expensive gadgetry . As such I have lots of experience with putting wet and dry protectors on my devices and other people's devices as well. I have used the zagg, armorshields, bodyguards and a few nameless brands from eBay.About this itemI read a few negative reviews of this item,  claiming it was hard to put on and that it bubbled etc  but still decided to go ahead as I used skinomi before and always was very pleased with the packaging and cuts .This item was well packaged in a black cardboard mailing tube.  In the tube:Solution for wet applicationSqueegee2 large sheets with detailed full body protectors for back and frontMicrofiber cleaning clothInstructionsAbout the materialThe clear protection film looks like any other but it is cut with many parts for the specific casing of the galaxy note.even the thin sides and the oddly cut parts are cut out with all the relevant openings exactly in the right place. Some of the other brands are not always as precise with their cut outs and you'll have trouble lining up the cut outs.Apparently this film is not going to turn yellow over time which is also a plus.The thing that worried me most was that the film would somehow obstruct the use of the s pen,  I thought it would potentially stop the s pen from sliding smoothly over the screen. Well it does not,  I am happy to report. I would almost say it makes the use of the pen better. This review was completely done by Swyping the s pen , for instance.Putting it onSo now about the issues with putting it on. There are no issues. The folks that complain simply have not done this before, properly followed instructions or are not very adept at DIY. This goes on like any other wet application and the cut outs are exact.I cleaned the device thoroughly with alcohol before applying and sprayed the sticky side of the film lightly. I also do always lightly mist both the surface of the device and my hands,  key here is to do it lightly.  If the environment is dusty then do this in the bathroom after creating some steam from the shower to keep dust from getting between the film  and device.Put the film on and and carefully position the various relevant cut outs. Once in position I Squeegee from the center outward in a star pattern until there are no bubbles.  Don't press hard, just Squeegee diligently.Keep brawny handy to absorb the Squeegee' d solution.If might look hazy or not fully clear for about a day or so but if you did this right it does cleat dry clear with no bubbles whatsoever. I cannot even see it on my note.It is truly invisible on my note and the pen slides with no problems .This is really not that hard and takes about 30 minutes to do the whole device.This is very well priced for this quality and again, this is like any wet application protector .

"Since the are already so many reviews on here for this item I thought I would add a specific angle. One that focuses on the use of the tablet as a graphics design tool mostly.I will also spend a moment discussing my other uses for the tablets I own and tell you what my experience is.Background you can skipI am not necessarily an Apple fan. As a matter of fact, I was always the type of guy building PC's, creating FreeNAS servers, experimenting with software etc. more Microsoft than Apple.The adoption of Apple into my household came when I started to buy computers for my Dad, nephews and nieces and MIL. Due to distance it became aggravating to get the calls where they were stuck with a blue screen or something else after downloading some virus or upgrading some driver. It was always something. So I decided that I would buy a tablet to see if my dad would be able to use that. That was e first Apple device into my home.I liked the usability, simplicity of the interface and the Apple-typical lack of buttons. All in all, I was pleased with how fast my 80+ year old dad was able to use it. No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.then cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.I found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them. I was a believer.I stuck with the iPads and am currently on the 4th gen. Since iPads are invading my workspace I find myself using it mostly and running into some of the limitations.How I use the tabletsI mostly use my tablet work wise for the development of graphics for presentations that outline complex solutions. We do not use standard PowerPoint stuff but have a philosophy of custom and hand drawn pictures that can, if necessary, be Peter live on a whiteboard.Since the ipad does not have any native pressure sensitivity I had to wait until someone came out with a pressure sensitive stylus. At this point there are a few on the market and after looking at reviews I settled for the Jot Not Touch. I mainly use it with Sketchbook Pro, Touchdraw and so on.Here are the limitations I have found:- the disk tip that is needed for precision on the ipad is still somewhat inaccurate and hard to handle. I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.- the pressure sensitivity seems to go off and on. Sometimes I find myself pressuring harder and harder to get the same results. This makes for lots of time spent handling the stylus and ipad combo rather than thinking about the quality of my graphics design- the styluses for the ipad that have reassure sensitivity either have weird tips or are bulky to handle. I am 5'11"".I also use the ipad to communicate via iMessage with all my family all over the world. iMessage is so simple and effective and I get it everywhere.without ads and other nonsense.Finally,and this is quite important once your have the Apple drug in your house: I have connected my home with a series of Airports and time machines. The airports connect to various stereo systems and apple TV's and I can simply control. Everything from my ipad, or my wife from hers.it is supremely easy and connected at a fraction of the cost I would have had if I bought the Sony or Bose solutions for this.Now about the GN10.1I bought it because I was working on another graphics project and got fed up with the clumsy stylus and ipad combo. I even paid overnight rush shipping to get it. And you know what, the Samsung embedded pressure sensitive stylus is so much better than the solution needed with the ipad. The tip is precise, the stylus is the right size, perhaps a little too light and thin but better than what I had for the ipad.I have spent less time messing with the hardware and more time on my work, so great kudosto Samsung.Also, the GN is fast, there is nothing to complain about with the 1.4 quad core compared to the ipad.The screen, however, on the ipad, is visibly better when. Drawing thin lines. It doesn't brother me too much since I can simply zoom in and the pixelation disappears but I can't wait for the next GN gen to see if samsung is going to up the ante and increase screen resultion.I also noted that the battery of the GN seems to notably outlast the ipad battery. My guess is that it outlasts my ipad battery by an extra 30% or so. Maybe because the Bluetooth stylus on the ipad hogs battery? I dunno, but again, Samsung gets it right-er, erer...So conclusion: as a graphics tablet solution the Samsung is hands down the winner. Ipad should not even be considered as a mature solution. The retina display is the only redeeming quality.When it comes to messaging etc... It's criminal what junk sits in the Google Play store. Everything seems invested with adware and when you buy versions with no ads you are looking at tons of different solutions... Which nes will your friends be willing to use? Now your friends have to start adding software to message you if you do not make the right pick. Especially when you have your friends and family spread over the globe.That is what I feel is really needed: a native android version of iMessage that works between any and all androids. Bridging into iMessage is not androids responsibility but for crying out loud, I don't want to download and pay for tons of crappy messaging software that does not let me reach my friends and family.  Apple wins.I am using Skype on both,  but find myself more on the ipad with iMessage to stay in touch.Finally, the integration into my household with the airports and stereo links. Luckily my synology audio android software can speak.  Airport, so there is a solution albeit a little bit jerryrigged. This android audio app streams and controls music on any synology diskstation and can feed it into your apple network if need be.  Apple, since they have a vertical solution that you can expand with, is very well integrated. Apple wins.I love both tablets, am deeply impressed with the Samsung solution since its not a simple copy and steal solution and love the ipad for its simplicity. However, for what I use them for work wise I would part with my ipad and stick with the Samsung given the graphics execution. Apple needs to step up in that area or they will lose out in schools, hospitals etc as the stylus model for note taking comes way more natural than thumbing your comments and notes.Sorry, for the avalanche of words. Hope there is some wisdom in here someone can still use.Ps: the apple soft keyboard is nicer than that on the Samsung BUT the wider screen on the Samsung makes it more convenient and natural. hope Swype makes me a convert.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCH6UQRD296ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DWG5HE#wasThisHelpful","RCH6UQRD296ZW","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot get enough of this album. Thank God it's a digital as a vinyl would have been worn out by now. There is something distinctly 60's in the orchestra and it reminds me a bit of Mancini.

"I bought this as a simple vest for when I am out on the motorcycle.I am 6'0"" and about 220 lbs. I cannot even close the buttons on this vest and I have no belly sticking out. So lesson learned: if you are a slim frame then go 1 size up. If you are broad shouldered or more athletic you might need 2 up.The material is soft and nicely washed denim.

"I travel back and forth between Chicago and NY about 30 times a year and this spinner was my faithful companion:- It fit perfectly in the overhead bins of the smaller planes (even wheels first)- It rolls very well, without tipping or halting, despite the plastic wheels- it packs 1 suit and enough shirts and undershirts and toiletries for a 3 to 4 day trip- The material is sturdy- Its very light- Sturdy zippersYou wonder why I give it only 2 stars?Well, the problem is they don't last. I just said farewell to my second one within a year. Both failed in the same area: the telescopic handle failed where the pins are retracted when you lock the handle closed op fully extended.It cannot be fixed.When the first one died 5 months after purchase I assumed it was a fluke and immediately bought a new one.That one lasted a little over 6 months when the exact same failure happened.Maybe OK as a bag for folks that do not fly too frequently given all the pluses but it should last longer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JW5HON8BGHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003IT5NP2#wasThisHelpful","R31JW5HON8BGHL","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe have a pretty large yard (4 acres) and wifey has planted it abundantly with roses, ground cover, young trees and so forth. The problem is that she was always on her knees with either a hedge trimmer or garden shears to clip the grass from around the plants. This made for hard work.So she set out to solve the problem and bought a basic Sun Joe electric grass shear.It did not last long as the batteries ran out WAY fast and there was no easy way to get the work done quickly: still a lot of crawling around and associated back pain and cramped hands. It finally died and she replaced it with a Black & Decker. That one was worse: the battery lasted a little over 30 minutes and took forever to recharge. It was not a success and ended up in the abandoned tool bin.About the 8893-U and the extension handleFinally we shelled out for this 8893-U shear by Gardena and the optional extension handle. I believe the technology of the shears comes from Husqvarna. It promised a long lasting battery, solid build and an extension handle that would make it the perfect fit. Except for the steep price.Here are our pros and cons:PROS:- Battery lasts well over 1 hr of continuous use. We were able to get the entire job done in one go. That's superb. Other required 3 runs/recharges to get this far,- The telescopic handle is a great option: saves your back- The wheels make it easy to walk around with: relives strain from your arms- The cutting head can be angled up or down- The cutting head can be replaced with another or different one- Its solid quality but light weightCONS- EXPENSIVE!! Basically 4 to 5 times as expensive as the cheaper brands. I still bought it since it does what it promises but wonder about the price point being overly padded. Took 1 star of for price/quality because of it.- The battery is built in, you cannot simply slip in another one. But again, it lasts so long on a charge that you don't really really need it. I am more wondering when the battery gets to its life cycle end.- If you think the unit is expensive, then try the telescopic arm. Another 50 bucks. Or the extra shears. Whoa. Everything on this item seems over pricedConclusion:If the cheap products out there fail you for the same reasons they failed us then what is too expensive? Granted, with telescopic arm included ( you need the http://www.amazon.com/Gardena-8899-U-Telescopic-Swivel-Cordless/dp/B0049PAXC2/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1336427357&sr=1-1 ) it comes pretty close to 200 bucks but I would say the time and aggravation it saves us is well worth it. The other units were simply unusable and therefore in their own cheap way overpriced.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CIXIONJUFPLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049PEPKI#wasThisHelpful","R3CIXIONJUFPLL","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Background you can skipWe wanted to replace our comforter, which was very 'dense' and hot with a non-down comforter which we could leave on in the summer and the winter. When we finally found that perfect comforter we needed a few sets of duvet covers, and since we bought a cali king size, our options were not that many  in the 50 to 80 dollar price range we were looking for. So we ended up buying a few duvet cover sets on smartbargains and overstock and we bought this one. This one in particular stood out since it was listed as an 8 piece set.The O and SB items were OK, kinda scratchy, flimsy, clearly, 'you got what you paid for'. This set, however, was a neat surprise.About this itemWhat we noted as the key pros:- Superbly soft feel. Like a fluffy soft suede feel on your skin- It's temperature neutral: never feels cold or warm to the skin yet it keeps you VERY comfortable in all temp situations- It is not 'slippery' on the skin, like some of the other bargain covers we bought, which is preferred by us- The closure is double stitched and has a nice button closure, rather than the standard fold over closure, which makes the comforter slip out.- The colors are muted but very fitting for a wide array of decors- The quadrant stitchings are high quality, i.e. nothing has frazzled after at least 10 washes since purchase- It comes with a complete set of pieces (pillowcases etc)- Holds its colorCons:- it only comes in this color scheme (that we could find), we liked this so much we bought 2 more but would have preferred some color variation- Requires some special handling when washing to keep it super soft: don't wash too hot and do not dry too hot. But no fabric softener needed.Conclusion: a great price/quality offering. This is our favorite cover set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0Z7XAX3FURY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048KZZ62#wasThisHelpful","R3A0Z7XAX3FURY","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI am a pro-mateur when it comes to photography. Never had formal training but got my first camera (Yashica) when I was 16 and never stopped shooting. Over the years I picked up quite some tips from much more gifted people what helped me get decent results in most lighting situations.I have a few serious lenses like the 24-70mm, 70-200mm and 85mm 1.4: all legendary but if photography is not your profession and you're not seriously loaded then they are quite a strain on your income.Currently I sport 2 camera's: a D90 (DX) and a D700(FX). I bought this lens specifically for my D700 body for when I go on trips where I do not want to schlepp too much around. I had (up for sale on THE auction website when writing this review) a few mid range zooms that I would carry on these trips: a 24-85mm and later I replaced it with a 28-105mm.Problem with both was that I still had to take a tele with me and that became a hassle.So I set out to find a lens similar to the all-round 18-200mm that my D90 was bundled with that would still give very respectable results. This is the one I settled for and I do not regret it.What can I say about this lens that has not already been said?- BIG: It's big but not BIG like some of the pro series teles. For its zoom range it is actually pretty compact.- LOW PRICE: the price point might seem high but in fact it is very cheap for the amount of technology that Nikon put in it. As a matter of fact, it is often noted in professional online reviews that this lens is being sold too cheaply by Nikon.- SHARP: I have seen some folks complain that this lens it not sharp. On my D700 it is VERY sharp. I would say that I can get it tack sharp if I really wanted to. Ken Rockwell noted that it is extremely sharp on his D3 as well. Possibly the people (1 or 2 reviews) used VR II while using a tri-pod? Here are some samples that Ken posted online:[...]- DISTORTED: Yes, at 28mm you'll get your fair share of distortion. It is expected at this price point and certainly not worse that anything else in this price range and the level above. - GREAT BOKEH: look at some of the samples online, bokeh is good looking and at 300mm you can create even canvasses.Overall conclusion:This is one of those lenses that will ALWAYS fetch you a decent resale price simply because it is such a great price / quality ratio. If you are like me, looking for a lens that will allow you to shoot in almost all scenarios without having to switch lenses and will not hamper your artistic ability with poor implementation then please shell out the 900 some dollars for this lens. It is worth every penny and some.Look at all the pro-reviews online and you will find that this lens does get rave reviews everywhere and you can shoot pro-quality shots with it with a bit of practice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0G4PT4K7L0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZSHNEA#wasThisHelpful","R3F0G4PT4K7L0O","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some context you can skip:I am not a computer expert but conider myself somewhat savvy. Having read so many negative reviews regarding this F5L009 network hub I was a little bit hesitant, but still decided to go through because of 3 reasons:- I really needed a way to share my Fujitsu Scansnap USB scanner to several iMacs and a USB switch I bought and tried was tedious and still requires separate USB cables- Quite a few of the negative reviews had 'off' comments about sharing USB devices similar to a print server. That is an unreasonable assumption and shows that the posters simply do not understand what the hardware / USB limitations are- The price was right on Amazon marketplaceSo I took the leap.About the F5L009:I use the F5L009 on a network predominantly occupied by Macs, but there is also a Windows 7 machine that is used. All Macs run 10.6.x Snow Leopard. I have connected to this device:1 Fujitsu Scansnap S15001 Epson 1660 Photo flatbed scanner1 Sans Digital RAID USB 4-bay storageThe F5L009 itself is connected to a gigabit switch which is connected to another switch which is connected to my WNDR3700 router.What I expected this device to do:I expected it to connect to an ethernet port on my switch, thus allowing me to access the connected ethernet devices from ANY computer on my network. This WITHOUT having to put any other USB cables in.I did NOT expect it to be wireless as I fully understood from the website and specs that this is ethernet connected. This DOES mean that if your network has a wireless access point / router that you can indeed access a USB device via a wirelessly connected computer. Quite a few negative posters seem to not have read the specs and blame their own misinterpretation and frustration on this device.I did NOT expect ANY usb device to be able to be accessed concurrently /at the same time: USB does not work that way and this is not really a problem: the hub comes with Windows / Mac software, a simple control panel, that you install on each computer. It is a small simple App that shows the available hub(s) on the network and the USB devices connected to it.  Note, which some complained about as well, that you will have to load the USB drivers for each device you are accessing on each computer. Makes total sense too.The control panel is also used to activate the connection to a particular computer that you want to use. If multiple computers are in use and want access then the person who is using the device will get a simple pop up request through the control panel asking to hand over the active control to another user on the network. As soon as that is accepted the control goes to the other user et voila.Simple and to the point. Not sure why people complain about clicking ACCEPT or REJECT, it works flawlessly with my devices.Again, I wanted this SPECIFICALLY because it works on Mac and it allows me to access my scanners from all machines on the network. It works FLAWLESSLY on Snow Leopard with the Scansnap and the experience is as if the device is connected to the machine with a direct connection. And it is FAST. I scanned a 50 page document and it was not noticeably slower than a direct USB connect. Scansnap pumped out the PDF's fast.To sum it up, what I liked:- It works, the easiest way to share a USB scanner over an existing ethernet and it works with other devices as well- It is simple: the control panel as well as the instructions- It seems VERY stable: the connection re-establishes itself if a computer was in hibernation and I have not had any program NOT recognize the scanners or the Sans DigitalWhat cost the item 1 star:- On 2 macs I had to install and find a specific newer version of a file that they did not include: it came up with an error message and when googling that I found the solution on Belkin.com. Little bit, but not a big, hassle but for non-computer people it might be more complicated if that happens (but Belkin and websites will answer)- The price: I think the suggested 100 bucks is rich. I bought it for less than half that on Marketplace and it is certainly worth thatClosing thoughts:Before you decide against this item based on negative reviews do understand that this device is not as simple as it appears. If you go in with the same expectations I had then you will be very happy with it.Again, do not expect you can hook up another regular USB hub to it and then get more network USB available, do not expect it to act like a print server without having to press a button (you can buy those much cheaper) and finally, read up closely what it is. If you do that this is a good buy. I'm happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNCJ496DYZ9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QSN3O6#wasThisHelpful","R2PNCJ496DYZ9Y","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two iMac's using a ScanSnap Fujitsu scanner and this device was supposed to auto switch between computers requiring access to the USB scanner. It is not a full hardware solution as others have stated as you have to install an application to select the device.Just selecting the scanner and triggering a scan does NOT trigger an auto switch.I rather have to go into the software on the machine I am using and select the scanner and then activate that USB line.The other Mac then , if it needs control to the scanner, needs to do the same thing.Needless to say: this does not allow for much time savings and only by a little defeats changing cables. For something called auto switch at a 20 buck price point is is surprisingly manual and I am therefore giving it 2 stars. The second one because it has pretty lights and does not need a power adapter but that is all it will get from me.Someone who has a better solution please post as I am still looking for a true auto switch.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AEXYDKYAR4FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SEB45M#wasThisHelpful","R2AEXYDKYAR4FT","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background (you can skip)Since so many reviews have already been written about this book I will keep this brief with my personal reasons why this book is so useful. I have bought TONS of photography books (at least 35), always looking for useful tips to get that pro look to my photos and extort Oooh's and Aaaah's from people looking at my collection. Lighting has always been my downfall, since I cannot seem to get the contrast, shadows, directions etc right. I bought expensive soft boxes and strobes and yet never learned to properly use them, even with all the books at hand. So I have been steadily looking for books that could give me good useful instruction on how to create positive results that would fuel inspiration (success is great fuel)!! I tried some of the books my pro friends recommended. like Light, science & Magic and found that those were too advanced and required too much skill / experience with some of the equipment (like strobes) to be the best start. And then I found this little 20 dollar lesson.About this bookThere are a few things that many photography books do that do not work for me:- The are THICK, I mean endless pages going through basics about cameras that I do not need, forcing me to spend too much time reading, which I do not have- They often assume deep wallets, ie. access to expensive equipment- They often assume everyone wants to be a pro-sumer / semi-pro, whereas what I wanted was just darn good looking pictures without excessive knowledge I will rarely use- Most of all, they assume you have tons of space and great lighting equipment.My reality is: I am a father of many kids, I have a busy busy life. I rarely have time to go shoot outdoors. Mostly I take pictures indoors and often in the evenings, but rarely in studio conditions. In fact, my house is cramped so I cannot set up backgrounds and strobes very easily nor do I enjoy it.Reading is something I enjoy with novels, not with photography or instruction books.Here are the reasons why I think this book excels:- It is thin and to the point- I think it immediately gives you USABLE, applicable instructions to take good looking photos, augmented by flash- It understands that not all of us have strobes, studio space and enormous soft boxes.- It focuses on flash photography albeit indoors or outdoors, augmenting natural light or being the main source.- It teaches quickly and efficientlyThe negative(s):- The first 10 pages are generic detailed scientific explanations of reflection and lighting. Tough material, but after that it gets applied!!- The actual size of the book: it should have been in a little smaller format as this is one you'd want to carry with you.Overall worth EVERY penny you pay for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ST5V13MONEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1584282584#wasThisHelpful","R12ST5V13MONEA","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI am sure that the collectors of fountain pens will buy this particular 'rubber and steel' model regardless of a somewhat-negative review. Since they are unlikely to use the fountain pen daily it is not going to matter much. I myself, however, bought this pen 3 years ago as a treat for a year well done.Given the price and my ownership of 'lesser' fountain pens from Parker and Waterman and Namiki, expected an instrument that would hold up well, if used daily. Here is where this pen fails...Under daily useThe problem is not with the flow of ink or the tip, no complaints there. I used this fountain pen with Noodler's Ink with no problems and the flow was smooth and bold, just the way I liked it. If falls apart on the cap, actually: the thread on the inside of the cap is plastic, whereas the thread on the pen is metal. Where plastic and metal meet plastic will wear out. So if you put the cap on and you tighten it like any other pen, you will find that over time, the cap no longer screws on.I reached out to Mont Blanc and they consider this normal wear and tear from use and since it takes about 3 years of daily use to get like this you are SOL. The MB Boutique would charge me a hefty 175$ for repair. This is simply outrageous for a pen that is supposed to outlive its owner and become something you can hand down to your children and so on.I have other fountain pens, some I have used for over 10 years before I bought this one, at around 200$ and none of them have exhibited this type of issue. I find it poor design to use plastic thread in a pen of this price. I am sure there will be MB fans out there aggravated for what I am saying here but believe me: I want this pen to be great and to last.In summary:PROS- Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but I think it to be beautiful- Rubber feels great in hand and keeps a firm grip- Good flow of ink and somewhat bolder than comparable tips I have used, which I like- Heavy, which I like for my writing- Well balancedCONS- Plastic thread in cap wears out FAST!! Repair is expensive- Similar pens from other brands (same price range) are better built, in my case Parker, Waterman and NamikiI gave it 3 stars since , if you are aware of the thread issue, you can be careful and avoid thread wear as much as possible (but not entirely).","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3GBNTH352KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002F4XM2C#wasThisHelpful","R1M3GBNTH352KY","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hope it helps some to decide for this excellent stamper. We love the quality and the company supporting it is really good to deal with.

This way Amazon did not strip it out from the mail AND the company correctly interpreted it and added the actual sign instead.We loved the Park Avenue font for our address label. Comes out looking superb.We added LOTS of text on it and it fitted: my last name is 23 characters and we were able to add my wife and my first name on the first line.

"I realize this will attract negative votes from the Windows community on here but I do this not out of fanboy-ism for MAC but the simple lack of usability for MAC AutoCAD 2011 users.The program does carry the same name and left me with the impression that this would work. Well it does not.You can probably piece together where to remap menus and shortcuts put that will severly hamper your efficiency to learn.Having said that, FOR WINDOWS USERS:This manual appears to be well written for WINDOWS 7 users (or XP). It shows plenty of screen prints etc to show how to get to settings and what they do.Again, the issue is that non of it is applicable for MAC users of AutoCAD.I have given it 4 stars since this is about the quality of the tutorial BUT the title and cover should have CLEARLY stated that this is OS specific and not at all usable for MAC.

"I ride a BMW R1200rt, which is a pretty large low hanging sport touring motorcycle. In my area there are 7 known problem lights, mostly left turns, where bikers get stuck.Since these were on sale with AS cycles I decided to give it a try and ordered it for my bike late summer 2010. I mounted it per the instruction and then took it upon me to go out on an early Sunday morning at 7 am to test it with these lights.Result: this did not work on any of the 7 lights. I still got stuck.This means that for a big heavy bike they are unlikely to make a difference. I can imagine that for a lighter bike with les metal or 'body' the magnetic interference this creates could potentially do something hence the 2 star review,Again, I wanted these to work but the test results, although not statistically significant I'm sure, did not give me any proof. I still left it under the bike, as a good luck charm.Ps: someone suggested mounting 2...

"I purchased this jacket for my motorcycle escapades: I wanted a classic looking flight jacket rather than the run of the mill biker jackets.The price seemed 'right' for this Sage green Jacket and I liked that is was the MA-1 standard issue replica.A couple of hopefully useful comment that can help you decide to buy or notRe Sizing:I am 6'0"" , 225 lbs. The extra large fits comfortable: not too tight and not too large and when I stretch my arms to hold the motorcycle handlebars there is enough arm-length so that my wrists are not sticking out. I do not understand those folks claiming the sizing is off by 2 sizes. I am always an XL and this cut is very standard excel.I could have bought a LARGE instead to make it fit more traditionally (these were worn body fitting back in the day I believe) and it would have looked fine but clothing underneath like a sweater or so would have been tight and my wrists would porbably show on a motorcycle. I will try and post a picture later so you can see how it fits.Re Color:Most likely the color you are seeing on your screen when looking at Amazon is more grass green than the jacket really is. It is really a SAGE green as the name says. Again, it is not a hard grass green but softer in color. The flip side is hard emergency orange.Re Build qualityThe zippers seem heavy duty copper. The pullers say MA-1 and the zippers open and close smootly and decisively without snagging or derailing.The cloth wristbands and waistband and collar pill only a little which is not visible from a distance and common for this material.The nylon outer shell is not the thin rain-coat material that you see in flimsy rain shells but several grades thicker. It is, in fact, precisely right in that it does not hinder movement but it sounds and feels like a thinner canvas cloth. The zipper has a wind-strip on the inside, ideal for riding, and the wrist bands are comfortable and tight to keep wind out. The lininig is polyester, so it is warm and keeps any critters out (mite)This jacket is definitely a steal for the 30 bucks I paid.Other commentsIt is fully reversible: you can wear the orange out and the only think that will look different is the wind-strip will be on the outside: this is GREAT for riding in the daytime and evening as you are truly visible. The inner orange side is thinner nylon, though.The nylon outer shell (green side) is water resistant: you can sustain some rain without getting wet but it is NOT, nor does it claim to be, a raincoat.I am very very pleased with this buy and will get the black version as well. Good stuff for bikers. Hope this review helped a bit in your decisioning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BQU2K3F7MAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LQB3BW#wasThisHelpful","R7BQU2K3F7MAI","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Background you can skipI realize a lot has been written everywhere about this lens. Just look at KenRockwell or DPReview and the sheer detailed reviews from fellow photographers around the internet. One thing is special about photo-ists: they are hardly fan-boys: if something is a-miss with a product then that get splattered out in gory detail, often with photo evidence... Why am I saying this? Because I think you can therefore trust the overall rating of this lens on the web. This one is often referred to as the model 1902, as well, by the way.I wanted to add my 2 cents since I have bought several lenses in the last year that are all very similar.  This review focuses on the 1.8 and 1.4 50mm lenses. The other 2 lenses are reviewed on their individual product pages. I thought some others might be trying to choose between these 2  lenses, but having a hard time determining the relatively steep price difference between the 1.4 and 1.8. I will not go into the technical differences between the 2 either as others that are more adept than me have done that and I am predominantly a person that focuses on the results and not the specs.The primes I own:85mm 1.835mm 1.850mm 1.8 ( http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1265596625&sr=8-2 )50mm 1.4 (this one)About this lensI bought this lens especially for portraiture. I am a hobbyist but my camera is glued to me (a D90) and I tend to shoot lots of shots indoors, capturing casual moments of my kids, pets and so on. Probably very similar to any other proud dad and hubby.Initially I did not want to shell out for the 50mm 1.4 and decided to get the well respected 50mm 1.8. I loved the 1.8 from the start. It was great indoors and even at the 1.8 f-stop it was sharp (with the softness that one can expect). The color rendering is beautiful and I love what it does to skin tones combined with the softness wide open. Since the 1.8 became my most beloved portrait lens I decided that it would be worth looking at upgrading to the 1.4. So I took the leap.Of course the extra light is great but do the photos come out magically better? No, not for the pro-mateur like myself. The AF is a little faster it seems and perhaps, but I am not sure, the colors come out a little more vibrant. Softness wise at wide open I think they are equally soft but the 1.4 gets tack sharp at f2 whereas the 1.8 needs to get closer to f4. I happen to shoot mostly in the f2 to f4 range so this is acceptable for both.The bokeh (the out of focus texture of the background that can make the subject look like it was placed in front of a wonderful milky pastel) is impressive on both lenses. I cannot say that there is a visibly distinguishable edge for either.Ofcourse the depth of field with the 1.4 is more pronouced than with the 1.8 at wide open.My simple conclusionI am not trying to compare a 100 dollar lens to a 300 dollar lens because the 300 dollar one is the better lens when you read all the reviews and I *think* I agree. However, when you are looking for value for money, the 1.8 wins hands down. You get so close to the 1.4 results and if you're a photoholic amateur like myself you will be deliriously happy with the 1.8. Once you have exhausted its capabilities (which will take most of us 20 years of learning) or you become enamored with sports photography (or your kids play ice hockey and you do not want to flash) then the 1.4 becomes more realistic.I recommend that if you are on a budget then you start with the 1.8. Once you are ready to upgrade you simply sell it, you will always get 80% of value back if well treated, and substitute with the much more expensive 1.4.Al the serious pros would simply jump straight to the 1.4 but that is not the audience this review is meant for. Hope this helps.A humble non-technical amateur photographer","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LI98SMU8PJ3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005LENO#wasThisHelpful","R3LI98SMU8PJ3F","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipThis review is from a duped buyer that ordered this 4GB Explore card.Upon arrival the card would not be read in my Nikon D90 (gave the infamous CHA message which refers to unreadable SD card media) nor my iMac nor my Windows 7 machine. So I went online and entered the Eye-fi website. There I found an email address for support and wrote about the fact that the car did not read. No answer after 24 hrs. 48 hrs pass and I write them again. In the meanwhile I enter their self-help forums and find to my surprise that there are quite a few frustrated posters on there dealing with non-working cards. I mean, hundreds of posts...While I leave a post there, asking the forum moderator where I can get an RMA as support does not respond, I get responses from Eye-fi employees telling me to format the SD card. GREAT ADVICE, especially after telling them in the first place that the item does not READ on any device. I get no response when I retort that there is nothing to format if the card does not read. No response... time passes. I write again to the forum, posting my  support query and asking for help on this expensive item. Again, there seem to be quite a lot of frustrated / duped consumers on there and by the number of posts these cards are POOR quality.Finally, after 5 business days I get an email back: "" we will close your support request as you have not responded to us"". A  total cop-out as I never received any response, nor did they show me one. It was also not in my junk-folder so a cheap way to get the consumer to take the blame ""since I did not respond"". The story goes on an on, but to make a long story short. THEY NEVER HELPED, NEVER OFFERED TO REPLACE THE ITEM NOR ANSWERED ANY QUESTIONS. And it took them 5 days.I hope that you are lucky and receive a working item, because if not, check out the eye-fi website/forum for the barrage of problems. This company launched a gadget that is , quality wise, not ready at all. Secondly, they are not staffed at all to deal with issues nor do they seem willing to provide after-market care.I finally found the seller of the item willing to replace it with a working one. And here is what I found:Key findings:- This card uploads either via the internet and then back to your PC when it is on or directly to a location via your wireless-g. That is a problem, why? Because a 5MB picture or a much larger video takes FOREVER. I shot 45 pictures at a party and it hijacked my internet upload bandwidth. When I switched off the internet relayed upload it still took several minutes per picture- It drains batteries FAST! You have to leave on your camera to have it wirelessly upload the pics and that drains the batteries fast. Especially with the slow upload speeds this thing NEVER seems to finish an upload before the batteries are empty- IF you have a disrupted upload (e.g. because of empty batteries) then it never seems to pick back up. I could NOT, for the life of me, get it to re-try uploading until I cleared the card- The relayed upload shows ALL of your pictures to the eye-fi employees and they, without asking, will look at them. I know because of forum comments. I value my privacy and they should have asked permission to view peoples photos- The software, sometimes and sometimes not, is quirky. Sometimes it would show photos being loaded to my network drive and sometimes it would sit idle for 30 minutes and then upload 1 picture, even though there are 20 or so on the card. Then it uploads 3 in a row and finally it tends to gets stuck on one of the pictures. My point: it NEVER EVER seems to work smoothly as intended. I have never been able to just click and walk aay to find my pics on the drive. Either the software crapped out, the batteries were drained, my internet was hogged for 4 hrs (relayed upload with 1.5/768 adsl is a bad combo) or the uploads got interrupted, this thing never functions fully. And this is the replacement.My recommendationI know that it is appealing to have a little card like this promise hands-free, worry-free operation of your pics, but it does not. In the end I am GLADLY back to spending 3 minutes to pull out the card from my D90 or Canon Vixia to upload via aSD slot on my computer. The wireless implementation is a cute idea with the worst type of implementation. The company, when your item fails (and odds seem to favor that), appears to care very little about your ordeal and openly ignores you.I recommend buying one, if you cannot help yourself, and get a squaretrade warranty or so on it. Those are like 7$ and if it then fails you can simply get a refund rather than going through the nightmare I went through.BAD !","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335IUNYCHS489/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001U0O5QO#wasThisHelpful","R335IUNYCHS489","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI was, as a teen, captured by the Guyver Manga comics which, back then, were really hard to get (I lived in Holland and it was the 80's). Somehow my older brother was able to get them and shared them with me. Then, a few years after, I got Guyver on video (the first anime of this series). It really brought Guyver to life for me and I became a big fan. Naturally I also got the Guyver feature movies on video but that is a whole other story and I will not go into that here.To make a long story short: this is a remake of the original Anime of Guyver that, I believe, stems back to the mid 80's. This remake was done in 2005.The story is brutal and intriguing as it progresses through increasing levels of attack and opponents that get stronger by the episode. It's never clear upfront whether Guyver will or will not win and the story does not get repetitive. There are a few 'quiet' episodes but overall this series deserves the large fan base and the remake.About this 2005 remake of Guyver:Bioboosted ArmorHere are a few key anime stats that might satisfy those shopping for this item:- 26 episodes- total of 625 minutes of anime- 4 DVD's in a single cover- you can have as English or Japanese voice over- TVMA: yes, I know Funimation tends to clean up gore, but this series was left intact. The blood flows richly, bodies get sliced in half and heads are blown off. Not for kids. Note that I bought the item on Amazon advertised as the Viridian Collection, in case Amazon switches pics or items. TVMA= TV Mature AudienceAbout the actual animeFor those of you that never saw the original series: this one is at a faster pace and much more gory. The English voice acting is actually very very good. Even the cheesy Chronos guys have ther share of Scottish and Aussie accents in some cases (although dubbed through sound effects.*****START OF SPOILER ALERT******This series, in case you do not know this, has received one key piece of criticism... it does not really end... it does not conclude. I never really got upset with that and it does not take away from the story. Some might want it to end with a true conclusion and the demise of Chronos, Guyver or both but it remains open. And with a bit of imagination you can see that it could actually have been meant as a conclusion. Perhaps some day someone will actually create the anime/manga conclusion that us westerners want... I do think it is possibly a cultural difference with the Japanese story tellers and the western audience as the ending seems to be a non-issue with the Asian audiences in general. Take this as you will: the ending is satisfactory and does not reduce the value of the series. At least it was not a quick-n-dirty Dalles style (remember Dallas?) ending where someone wakes up and it was all a dream (ie. a dirt cheap 5 minute cop out ending).*****END OF SPOILER ALERT******Conclusion:- Guyver never gets old: the story is pure manga, so a real must have for people looking for great entertainment. 625 minutes for 35 dollars is a great bargain- You will watch this again periodically- Now that my kids are older they have taken a real liking to it and anime in general- If liked Samurai 7 (another awesome anime) then you will love this","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQ1TRGR39B1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002R69MBI#wasThisHelpful","RKQ1TRGR39B1X","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this bad habit of buying electronics without needing them. So naturally our house is chockfull of gadgets and adapters. We have made it a habit, for purchases over 100$ to buy Squaretrade warranties as we have a great experience with the company. With claims as well as with the fairness of their warranties (transferrable, easily managed and so on).Their website... is easy to navigate. You can see all your purchased warranties and its detail. You can email in your invoices and it will be electronically added to your warranty so that when the time comes that you need to file a claim, you do not get hassled to find some 2 year old paper invoice or find that your mail file was purged since. No scans needed either. LOVE this feature. Also the fact that you get clear email confirms on everything you do. Like when I sent in the invoices to the automated invoice registration: I received an email back confirming receipt and acceptance.About supportI have about 38 items under warranty, from iPod's to Time Capsules to whole iMacs to dvd and blu-ray players. Had 2 events, one for a 24"" lcd, where I need to get it repaired and the company stated it was not covered under warranty. Squaretrade took insta-care of us. The other time we had the same no hassle, no nonsense experience.Do understand that if you think about gaming their fairness (no, not you, the other guys I am addressing): they will see you show as a statistic and start to become suspicious I suspect. But that is besides the point.About this iPod Touch 3 year warranty:Compare and note that this is DIRT cheap compared to any other out there. AND it is fully transferrable for when you sell your iPod to the next owner: that is great piece of mind for them as well.Do it, you'll thank yourself later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UAH7USYX0UTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001N84M5C#wasThisHelpful","R2UAH7USYX0UTB","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe're what you call a connected home: several PS3's and several XBOX360 and 2 Wii's to boot. Why? Because we always have tons of kids over (at least 4 sleep over a weekend) and they love playing against each other or compete online. Anyways, that is not the point of this review. This review has to do with a side effect of having this many consoles: batteries/charging is a must. Obviously you cannot buy single-use batteries for this many controllers so we've looked for rechargeable solutions.This review is about the Wii's solutions. We've tried afew. Some OK, some great some not. The latest is this T-Strap Charger.About the T-StrapThe assumption with this charger is that you will have everything you need in one place and it cannot be lost: a charger cable, rechargeable batteries and a battery cover.Sounds like a simple enough idea but does it really solve any issues? Not for us, in that what we care most about is that the battery holds its charge long, and secondly, that it charges fast. We were not so much seeking a solution whereby we can assemble or disassemble the unit into a charger.Cons:* Assembly of plug is not easy, requires nails and some force. Perhaps good for little kids.* Strap fabric with swings of hand can get hot on skin and is somewhat uncomfortable* Charge cable not long enough so you have to keep controller within 12"" or so from Wii* Did not seem to hold its charge as long as rechargeable batteries with 2800mAh* Better results with fast charger and good rechargeable batteries, also because you can switch those when empty, as those charge faster* When internal batteries run out of live they would be cumbersome (if at all possible) to replacePros:* Good for cluttered rooms where you might lose items* Aesthetically pleasing* Novelty valueConclusion:Not a bad item but does not seem to fill any real need for us: did not charge fast and did not keep charge very long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOYOBJPJ10TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DMUCVQ#wasThisHelpful","RUOYOBJPJ10TM","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI lost interest quickly in my new PS3 in 2007 when I figured out that I would simply never truly master the controller like the next generation of kids. In my 30's I had all of my serious gaming skills built up on PC's using the mouse and keyboard as my weapons.I could never really control my thumbs so well as to place a perfect sniped headshot and I could never aim fast enough before someone pumped me full of electronic lead. So I gave up, kinda. Started to use the PS3 more as a blu-ray player and skipped key new releases of games. But out came CoD5 WaW and I really wanted it badly. At that time there was one mouse option for the PS3: Splitfish's FragFX. It was cheap plasticky and did not get that many great review but I shelled out the 80 bucks. I went through 3 of those as the build quality was poor and they did not last long but man, was I getting good.Out comes the MLani, redubbed FragNStein. It looked like the much promised-nver-delivered FragFX Wireless and for a mere 80 bucks it was a steal.About this itemIt truly feels and handles like a quality gaming mouse. Both pieces are heavy PVC and  feel 'right' in your hand. Setting it up on the PS3 requires no work: plug it in, sync it (much like a bluetooth) and everything works.What I noticed is that is actually moves the reticle in Cod games VERY smooth. You can increase sensitivity but factory default is really good. I had to get used to the large item in my hand for a few days but then I picked up where i left off with the fragFX and never looked back.Here are the pros:- Smooth movement of reticle- Very customizable settings via PC software (no Mac)- Heavy duty quality parts- Can be used as a common mouse as well- Controller part has motion sensing- Customizable turbo shot, works on all games- Customizable DPI- Low power usage and auto powersave built in- Good online support (needed help and Bannco responded and helped on Sunday!)Cons:- Little tricky to get it setup on computer for configuration- Keys cannot (yet) be programmed for pressure sensitivity- R3 button for PS3 is wheel and not great for knifing in Cod for example, however, is programmed for superfast corneringConclusion:Old schoool PC gamer wanting a PS3?

"Background you can skipI have used various programs over the course of several years. Mostly 'consumer' type programs like Uleads PhotoImpact as well as Corel. As good as these programs are for easy and straightforward photo-editing, they did not really satisfy once I made more serious photography attempts. I resisted upgrading to Adobe CS3 or 4 because of my fear of the complexity of something as 'pro' as CS4. Secondary concern was the price-level.After discussion with colleagues and fellow photo enthusiasts I decided to get CS4 and found a good deal on a used copy. After a few times of meddling with it I decided it was indeed daunting. Then I got the opportunity to try this video trainer and chose to try it before I shelled out for a conventional book or even a beginners course in our local community college.About this trainingI was surprised about the clarity and simplicity of how it is executed. You get shown how to do things at a brisk pace without a lot unnecessary (initial;ly at least) information, i.e. this is VERY efficient from a CS-newbie point of view. I was able to follow the basic steps and apply them very quickly to photos that I was trying out on.There is, ofcourse, lots thta is not covered in here given that this is really meant as a beginners basic instruction. It is not going to get you the depth and detail of one of those thick (surf Amazon!!) encyclopedia type of books. Instead, it will give you a simple and efficient way to get comfortable with the basics and actually get to the point where you got results with your pictures worthy of saving!I am a believer that this method, level of detail and method of instruction work VERY well for beginners and highly recommend this to anyone as CS-green as me.*************UPDATE: after 2 months of use I feel that I am able to make the next step and have finally ordered a more comprehensive guide (see other review). I would not have been able to follow that as smoothly had I not spent this 40 or so dollars. I have use is frequently over the last to moths and still highly recommend it.Great product!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVYRQANXKDSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321634934#wasThisHelpful","R3JVYRQANXKDSI","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:19 MinsThis is actually a vid of the better-tested BK-80D Flowtron, but since I already wrote a text review there with pics I decided to upload the proof of its zapping power somewhere else. I think this speaks for itself: 19 seconds and 19 zaps (and this was only at 9PM), it gets to 2 zaps a seconds. Every morning we have found a heap of insect parts under the Flowtron and steadily the yardspace is ours again. Day by day. Awesome cheap solution without techno babble. Somehow it works wonders on our mosquito problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXK144OIKCJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004R9VW#wasThisHelpful","R3OXK144OIKCJ4","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipNormally I stay away from writing reviews for items that have already been throughly reviewed and compared as I can be of more help writing about the stuff no one else has tried yet. In this case, since it became such a huge unsolvable problem for us, I felt compelled to write about going 'low tech' for a change.Here's the scoop: we moved to a new home in late 06: 4 acres, large 12,000 gallon pond, about 1 acre grass, the rest trees/wooded.Little did we know that the previous owners had put that pond in because of the excess water in the area. The trees were virtually always, except during summer, in puddles or swamp waters. With the recent turn-to-wet climate this problem got exacerbated. Net result: swarms and swarms of mosquitoes taking over our lot. Even the UPS guy and our postie complained when they had to deliver. We had the city come out but other than once a season spraying there was no solace.So we looked online and finally settled for what we considered the high tech solution: the Mega Catch Premier.. We bought 2 and paid heftily for those...250$ a piece. The concept was a machine that fools mosquitoes into chasing it as it presents itself to mosquito senses as a living breeding and bleeding mammal. It basically looks like a black plastic square box with some openings. In the top part of the box are colored blinking lights (led) that rotate. Aparentlhy mosquitoes see this as movement. Secondly, under those lights, there is a large computer style fan that creates downdraft...into a compartment below when you keep octenol and a bowl with sugar water and hotdog bits. (?) Kid you not.It actually did make a dent in the population. Let us not claim it was useless, because it was not. The problem with the MC was really about maintenance, cost of maintaining and ultimately durability. Both lasted about 1.5 years before they sputtered and died. The bowls with the liquid often filled up with mosquitoes and other flying insects (millions of moths) and then dried to a hard crust. Ipso facto: clean it often!! Horrendous. Secondly, the fans would become encrusted with insect bits and ultimately jammed until you scraped them. Finally, the octenol was expensive and not easily changed (little jamming door that would make the liquids spill).To make a long story short: super high tech concept, often claimed to be better than the even more expensive (uses propane) Mosquito magnet.Well it was, but not for long and it was a pain to keep up with nor did we want to spend such an amount again for a half-functioning solution.We then started to read up on websites and found the long-been-around Flowtron 80D. The smaller models did not get great ratings (albeit not half bad for dirt cheap zappers) but the BK-80D stood out. Here on Amazon it got close to an avg. of a five. Other sites, with plenty of real life desperater people in similar situations as ours, it was listed as the simpelest and most effective remedy.About the Flowtron BK-80DSo we shelled out 2x 80$ for 2.  Thanks to Prime we got them 2 days later for free (did I say I heart Amazon?).The units are larger than you might think, and in order to show the size I added some pictures up top with my hand next to it. I am a 6ft male so you can see that these aren't small units.The unit is not heavy but bulky and make of very sturdy plastic that apprently can handle years of UV damage. Many folks have had these uinits for 5 years plus (it seems to have been in the market since the late 90's which is proof that it is a working concept).The 80 watt light is big and in a U shape and on the bottom you have 2 Octenol slots. You get 1 x 30 day cartridge. You do not have to use Octenol but we know it works even better with it. (you can order cheap refills online nowadays with free ship for lesst than 5$ a cartide).The outside grills, made of plastic are horizontal but the inside electric zapper grid is vertical in orientation. More so the bottom is left relatively open apart from the Octenol slots. This is VERY important, as other devices clog up. This one: you will collecvt a heap of insect parts below it. Much easier to clean.That else is there to say: the electric cord is about 6 inches so you need to connect it to a longer outdoor extension cable to have any type of reach. The unit has a big ring so you can hang it on a planter pole or anywhere else.Some important tips from others that do workWe read the manual and had picked up some good pointers online: do not hang these within 20 to 25 ft from where you want to sit! Effectively this thing attracts mosquitoes and other flying mini-bloodsuckers and unless you enjoy the pain (...) you would not want to sit in a cloud of those. As one (funny!!) reviewer commented: ""Capt'n, the thing does not work, it actually attracted mosquitoes and I could not sit outside anymore"". This person had put the Flowtron right next to their chair. Really: 25 ft or so is perfect: one of them, this morning, had at least 300 mosquitoes hanging around on the siding, staying close to the unit taking their mid day nap. At night, sunset, they become active and the zapping kicks into hight gear.Tip #2: fo look at the source of the mosquitoes and strategically place these. Even though it cover 1.5 acres a piece, you can get more out of it placing it close to the source of the evil. DO NOT place it where it does not stand out, ie. do not choose to hide it out of sight, place it where you need it.#3: Determine when mosquito-twilight starts. Ours starts at 7pm and lasts until about 7 AM when they disappear to the swamps. To save electricity, the bulbs and cleaning: but a timer or a dusk-til-dawn photocell timer for 5$ and add those.#4: use the octenol. It does help. You can buy it cheap nowadays. What is 5$ for 40 days of mosquito-slaughtering. Revenge is priceless I'd say.#5: Hang it between 4 and 6ft from the ground, not too close to a wall. Seems most effective,others noted, we tried and saw interesting pickup in bodyparts.Other comments:We, at first, thought we were duped. We hubg the Flowtrons at about 5PM and the occassional zap, one every minute or so, occurred. At that rate we'd never be able to get a habitable patio/outdoors.But BEHOLD: around 7.30 PM to 8 in the evening when the sun heat started to recede, the party began... it became a NON-STOP zapping. I literally mean 1 or 2 a second. At it lasted all night. The kids even complained that the thing kept them up all night (had one right outside their window which was open, but with bugscreen;)) . We ran out after day 1 and there was a gray circle below the Flowtron on the ground. Just insect parts. So many it was gross.This thing killed more mosquitoes in one night than the MegaCatch did in a week I am estimating.After 2 (!!!) nights we experienced a significant decline in attacks and give or take a week or 2 more we will be able to stay outside without the bugsprays, citronella torches, long sleeves... what a relief!!We are truly grateful we tried Low tech! For once.PROS and CONSNeed we say more? See above (my fingers hurt from typing.) Hope the pictures do it justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYWWM0ZZ4ZOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004R9VV#wasThisHelpful","RQYWWM0ZZ4ZOF","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe have, or I should say HAD, a microwave hood right over our cooktop. The builders of the home had taken some shortcuts and installed the hood WAY too close to the cooktop (dangerous) and they also had not installed any ducting.Natural result of such and environment is that the microhood died on a O/D of grease in the interior.So we set oput to find a decent range hood alternative that would hang at the right height over the cooktop and pretty quickly found that there was NO WAY that a microhood existed that would fit. Also, we found, we could not find replacement cabinets in the same style  as the kicthen to create more room over the  cooktop to retrofit a new microhood.Conclusion: buy another microwave that is not a hood AND find a range hood that would not exceed 7"" in height so that it would not be too close to the cooktop.Secondly, find one with enough CFM to work well for our wokking and excessive cooking.Thridly, try and find all this WITH a recirculation option so that we would not have to try and put expensive ductwork into the home.Forth: have it fit our stainless look kicthen decorAnd lastly, get all this for under 400$.About the ZEPHYR AK1200We shopped and shopped and always found something amiss: either not enough CFM, no recirculation option, too expensive or a combination thereoff. 2 brands did jump out at us for reasonable prices, good CFM and nice designs with low profiles: SUMMIT and ZEPHYR.Under 400$ it is almost impossible to find all this, mind you.The ZEPHYR AK1200 won for us because of a couple of reasons, that we consider pros.PROS:) Price, price, price0 Non-obtrusive design that cann fit into any decor.0 All stainless outside, no plstic black panels etc as the Broans in this price range sport. the controls are in a plastic panel but under the hood.0 Lighting with dimmers (2 step, not halogen), 2 lights, well aimed at cooktop and easily cleanable with glass covers0 400 CFM!! For this price. Awesome0 Large single blower/fan cage.0 Cheap recirculation option: under 20$!! Very cheap.0 Low sones at low speeds, does get noisy when blowing full speed but that is the price of most CFM0 Again, can be installed ducted (3.25"" by 10"") or ductless0 Easy clean dishwashed aluminum filters0 Really low profile at 5.25"". perfect for those that need under cabinet without excessive space available for larger hoods.0 Timer feature on blowerCONS:0 Not as silent as hoped, but as silent as it gets in this pricerange.0 Control panel un underside of hood, easy for wifey but I have to still feel around a bit.0 Some mighht find the design not very inspiring.0 Fan cage is plastic0 Little on the loud side in all 3 settingsCONCLUSION:The ZEPHYR's offer excellent designs at perfect prices. Not excessively expensive but with features that compare to >500$ hoods. If this is too bland, look at the ZEPHYR or SUMMIT more expensive lines. They get very modern but unfortunately too high profile for us. Even the Boran's we looked at did not compare, being a low end manufacturer. This stuff is Excellent price/quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUXE1IHF1VHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019DEHU6#wasThisHelpful","RQUXE1IHF1VHW","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI am obsessed with certain items. Watches, fountain pens and cameras. In my fountain pen collection I own a reasonable variety of well known brands:PelikanWatermanMontblancParkerCrossShaefferLamyWaterfordNamikiso that gives me a background to compare against. I like broad nibs the best but medium does just fine (no pun intended) for me as well as broad nibs are not always available. My writing style is that I have 'wild' swings in my writing, almost like when someone jots down a signature: forceful, fast and with swings. the other quirk is that I hold the pens slightly rotated off center. Keep this in mind when reading this review as it complicates matters for the pen a bit.I will not go into the other brands on here but solaly focus on the Carene. I own it with a medium nib, this exact model.About the Waterman Carene Medium nibSize: I would call this a standard size. It is well suited for a 6' person, does not look flimsy in the hand. It might be a tad large for women but certainly not noticeable uunless you have someone like me looking at it.Weight: this pen is relatively lightweight. The metal is light in the hand but not so light that all the writing pressure on the tip has to come from your hand. The pen has just enough weight on its own.Balance: given the lightness of the metal the pen can be used with the cap stuck on the back without significantly altering the balance. This is important for me as I have made that a habit over the years.Material: it appears to be a very light metal. I'd guess it is aluminum. The black front piece is a composite, much like Montblanc uses for it whole pens. The trim is silver as is the nib.Styling: this is where the Carene really hits the home run. This pen attracts lots of ""oohs and Aaaahs"" and people want to hold it. Its Azure blue and silver abd black color scheme is unique and looks extremely rich. Its smooth timeless lines can be perceived as modern or minimalist. Nothing overdone on this pen and I just love it. The nib is wedged in with a bow. Look closely at the pics. Very very beautiful design!!!Most importantly, handling: This pen has a little bit of trouble keeping up with my writing style. It sometimes fails to ink fast swings when using regular ink and requires a bit more pressire than I prefer to get the ink to flow. Since the nib is wide and short, it does not have a whole lot of flexibility so when you write sllightly tilted like me you might have to sometimes correct missing lines in your writing. Also, given the little extra pressure needed when writing I cannot use it without getting a little tired in the hands.Conclusion: not my preferred daily writer but a gorgeous piece of functional jewelry that can be used for regular work needs. Not something you'd write a few pages in a letter with given the less forgiving nature of its design. For the price I think this is an excellent deal but look around carefully as there are big discrepancies in price online. Mine was sub 200.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BNXQUFKKUZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007UECC0#wasThisHelpful","R29BNXQUFKKUZW","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will focus this review on the XBOX 360 vs the BD-P1600 as a Netflix player. If you are looking for real detail on the Samsung as a Blu-ray player then please look at other reviews as there is plenty written about that and I wanted to give the Netflix community some information.We already have 3 XBOX 360's in our home and have been using those mainly as game consoles for the kids (2 of them) and one of the as a media center app to play music and watch movies over Netflix.Our internet connection, very important for streaming is 1.5 Mbps ADSL from Verizon. When doing speed tests I can get a steady download run-rate of 169K per sec, so I am getting my 1.5Mbps worth.My XBOX 360 is connected via a wired / ethernet cable.First key difference: qualityBelieve it or not, and I hope to hear from others that can confirm the same finding: the Samsung produces a MUCH better picture than that we used to get on the XBOX 360 via Netflix. We did not expect this as we bought the Samsung as a Blu-ray player and thought the Netflix would be the same heavily pixelated / compressed picture that was really fuzzy, that we were used to from the XBOX. But it is not!! This is what triggered me to write this review. We had resigned to the fact that we needed to get a faster internet connection but that is no longer needed. Somehow the Samsung produces a sharper picture, much less fuzzy, as if you are watching TV, whereas the XBOX seems very fuzzy and out of scope. Almost as if you cannot really get it in focus. This alone is worth every penny for the Samsung: if you have a low speed DSL like us, the it is a must.Second difference, Interface:I find the Samsung interface much easier (simpler) than that of the XBOX. Not as many click throughs and if you have a series in your cue then you can go from episode to episode on the main movie screen.Third, Supported Formats:Just to be sure you know: the XBOX, as of the date I wrote this review, does not offer a Blu-ray player. So ONLY the Samsung is a blu-ray. Both, however, play DVD and upconvert to 1080P.Fourth, Upgradability:Both players can be upgraded, i.e. the Netflix firmware etc, but the interface for the XBOX is simpler and I suspect there is much more processing power in the XBOX. Strangely this does not seem to improve speed, though. I'd give the XBOX an edge on upgradability.Fifth, Speed:***UPDATE*** After the recent firmware update the cue has slowed down on me. I have to correct this FIFTH point: the XBOX Live interface is much faster.Sixth, Interface:The Netflix interface on the Samsung is very different from that of the XBOX. It starts faster and has fewer click throughs. I love its simplicity. Samsung wins over XBOX here.Seventh, Reliability:There are some people that claim unreadable movies. Having had the same problem I noted it was more of a 'not reading the information online' issue. Once I added a 1GB USB dongle (8$ on Amazon) it all worked like a charm. Consider the 3600 player if you want memory and wireless built in.Eight, Supported connections:Samsung, since it is a blu ray, supports BD Live. Both XBOX and Samsung have ethernet. Both have a wireless expansion dongle that you need to purchase separately. I'd go for a Powerline networking kit like the Actiontec or Panasonics so you can stay wireless and maintain solid connections in case you do not want wireless but have no ethernet lines close by. Both equally equipped.Conclusion:If you are looking for a Netflix solution and ignore the gaming feature in the XBOX and the Blu-ray player in the Samsung the the Samsung wins by a mile due to quality of image. There is a visible improvement from the XBOX and we ent from no longer using our XBOX for streaming Netflix to watching mostly streaming on the Samsung.However, if you are looking for the Blu-ray or Gaming capabilities then your choices are clear as well.Hope this helps a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TNSY0AYUEAUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TK3D4A#wasThisHelpful","R3TNSY0AYUEAUZ","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI remeber a few years ago, 8 or 9 years, that the first generation of these came out. And I remember struggling with a kit that I bought (I still have the antique in a box somewhere): the throughput was occasional, i.e. it would not always connect and setup was a nightmare. SO I gave up and thanked the stars for wireless. However, as great as wireless seems, the sheer number of devices connecting wirelessly made me wonder about the unknown effect of such signals on a human body. A less esoteric reason to try powerline adapters was the fact that one of my sons could not get a decent wireless signal to his XBOX 360. It would randomly lose connection and I tried lots of things like antenna boosters and re-transmitters of the signal etc. Nothing helped much. In came the powerline trial. And it was Amazing: speedy throughput and not a problem in my spaghetti wired home.About this itemThe adapters are small and plug into an outled if you had'nt figured that. My home has lots and lots of wiring but the adapters had no problem with that. Setup actually really was 2 minutes: plugged one in near my router, made it the master, then plugged the other in next to the XBOX 360 and made it the sub. Then I synced them so they found each other. Finally I plugged ethernet cables into them: one to the router and 1 to the XBOX et voila.Throughput, as I said, is superb: my kids have no issue with XBOX Live anymore and even better: I can stream high quality video to the XBOX from my server (using TVersity). In the past that was choppy on wireless, i.e. not watchable. Now it is smooth and instant. I stream music, video, play online and do all that without hiccups and potentially bad 'rays' crowding my home. I will not go back to wireless and expand the number of units in my home (you can connect lots of 'em).Pros- Easy setup- No problem with old and messy powerline wiring- FAST throughput (I get to about 145 MBps), internet needs 1.5 or so for DSL and 3 to 6 for cable, so plenty!- Small attractive units- Easily expandable- No potentially harmful radiation- More consistent level of throughput than wireless- No distance or signal restrictions (although speed is not going to get to the 200Mbps)- Unlike other brands out there, this one can be set to encrypt via the hardware so your neighbor cannot piggyback on your network. up to 128 bit, so just fine.Cons- cannot seem to be commingled with other brands. Tried it with my Panasonic powerline adapters and did not work, so you're probably brand specific when you go powerline.- Can only be used directly in wall socket, no extension plugs and avoid adapters in the same socket.Conclusion:A GREAT solution to get 'online' in a though corner in your home, like in the basement. Mine even works on a garden outlet so I can get great spead outside. Easy to install. I give it 5 stars. Also, expect 50% of the advertised speed, but VERY consitently, so it beats wireless for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBOC9YAUG9E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OOZ1X2#wasThisHelpful","R3IBOC9YAUG9E7","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipWe purchased our current home about 2 years ago and slowly started replacing the somewhat dated or low-quality appliances that had been left behind for us. Most of it was Frigidaire or Kenmore. Nothing wrong with that, but we wanted to get a better fridge, microwave hood, dishwasher and cooktop. This review, naturally, is about the cooktop only. The other items ware reviewed elsehwere on Amazon.What were we looking for?ONE - Well, first of all, we wanted HEAT: we are very much into Asian food and cook mostly in our Wok(s) (see other reviews as well!). This requires high BTU output.TWO - We wanted an aesthetic stainless steel look, a little more like the professional Bertazzoni or Viking type cooktops.THREE - Quality. We wanted heavy cast iron grates that would withstand heavy daily use.FOUR - Space.  We needed sufficient space around the wok to be able to cook properly on the high heat burner if using a larger wok (16"" or so).FIVE - Ergonomics. The control knobs needed to be in the front due awkward positioning in the kitchen, leaving little room on the right hand side towards the back to reach or see the knobs properly.SIX - Finally, we needed ALL OF THE ABOVE to be squeezed into a 30"" cooktop.About this item - KFGS306VSSAfter much research we decided that the KitchenAid Architect II series was the one to get. It featured 5 burners of whuch the middle burner is a 15,000 BTU burner (18,000 BTU on 36"" version) whereas most cooktops in this pricerange top out at 4 burners and 12,500 BTU max.It has the control knobs on the front and is a very industrial looking design.The grates are heavy cast orin and you get 3 of them. All in all, this one delivered on all fronts in the specifications that we set out.Upon receipt of the item, we found that the 1st rule of construction (closely related to Murphy's Law)applied to us as well: if something can go wrong or get complicated it will.And it did. The CUT-OUT dimensions of this cooktop did not fit the existing (and what we believed to be standard dimensions) in our countertop. This KitchenAid requires the following:Depth, Opening: 20 in.Width, Opening: 29 in.Our existing cutout was 28.5"" by 19.5"". Ofcourse this represented a horrendous problem in installation as we had to get the coutertop opening cut out further.Anyways: some masking tape, a pneumatic sabre saw (14.99$) and some saws and that was solved as well.Pros:0 - Lots of heat from 15,000 BTU burner0 - Well positioned (center) dual tier wok burner0 - Full stainless look, i.e. everything except grates is stainless0 - 5 burners, instead of the common 4 on a 30"" form factor0 - 3 cast iron grates that allow for sliding pots across the surfaceCons:0 - Knobs are plasticized, i.e. they can melt if you put a hot pan on them0 - No wok ring with the set, not cool as it would have been perfect with center burner and cheaper brands do include those0 - Slightly odd form factor for cutout. Not a real problem but just a 'BE AWARE' when you have an existing kitchen cutout.ConclusionWe are extremely pleased with this cooktop given all the features. What we did not like were the plastic knobs: they look great but I feel they could have included something better. I assume it is a heat resistant laminate/composite so I am not sure about the melting but I think it should have been solid metal. We reduced 1 star for that.

"Background you can skipWe recently had some near misses due to extreme rainfall in Northwest Indiana. Our dated sump pump, of the kind with battery backup, what slowly kicking it and we decided we needed to have the next one ready and waiting some the day it would croak.Naturally, being a bargain hunter, I set out to find the cheapest possible solution. That, however, is not wise when dealing with potential water damage. We ordered this one given the HP listed, the dirty water cability and most importantly the price.About this itemIt looks like a common sump pump except that it seems slightly wider. Also, the 'floater' seems to have more leeway that with a normal run of the mill pump. It comes with a few extra adapters so you can hook it up easily. Our findings are that the floater tube is long and floats freely. The width of the pump is slightly more than that of our current battery backed pump which made it difficult to put in. Also, the connectors are in an 'odd' place so we had to get extra rubber pieces to make it connect.The pump is loud when pumping out and seems to click on and off alot. Seems to be in the electric design of the floater unit. It does , however, handle dirty water well and the HP power is sufficient.Pros0 Cheap0 Dirty water capable0 Decent HP0 Long electricity cord0 plenty extra connectors (e.g you can hook up a normal water hose, making it great as an emergency back up in case your old pump breaks)0 PortableCons0 Long floater tube seems to switch off and on alot more than other pump0 Lots of HP but still only 1800 gph? Probably due to handling particles?0 Plasticky, not so sure it will last in continuous operationConclusionI would not buy this as my only main sump pump. I would but this as a back up and use it with the hose connector in case I would need to pump a pond or so empty. The reason: it seems very plasticky. Not very high GPH either. Overall, though, given the price, I consider this better than the lowest grade Home Depot or Menards sold pumps (which DO NOT last more than 2 years). If more expensive I would ahve given this 3 stars nut given the 50$ I give this ****.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R9DAFM3AJQ25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W8LFJA#wasThisHelpful","R2R9DAFM3AJQ25","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI am experienced in laying laminate floors as I always chose to go that route with our past homes. Our current home, however, had a partial hardwood floor installed... and the rest was carpet of the brand 'Nasty'. So that had to go. Ripping out the 700 sq ft of Bruce Hardwood flooring would be a nightmare given that it was stapled and and I also felt it would be capital destruction as it is valuable and pretty.So I opted to buy another 2000+ sq ft of hardwood and finish what the previous owners started.Once I started witht he diningroom I noticed something that I never really experienced with Laminate... it was a pain to keep the boards tight and then once you had them tight you had to KEEP them tight while hammering. I tried all the online suggestions: using planks, boards, wedges, scalpels and what have you to create leverage to get the board together but , although it does work, I could not believe the job would be finished quickly and professionally. I needed something better and I assumed that someone MUST HAVE thought of a solution.Anyways, I am a quick learner and a search on Amazon put me in touch with this baby, the QuikJack.About this itemAmazon got it to me overnight (i heart Prime Membership) and I lost little time.The item is pretty big and sturdy. It is a specially designed Jack that leaves your hands free to operate your cleat nailer (I bought a pneumatic one, LOOOOVE IT!!).As you can see from the pictures: you can create lots of easy configs and floorpositions for this jack. I did not nail it in but used a stud that was offset against the wall for leverage. Worked SUPERFAST. I think I went 10x faster than the manual solution. This was truly worth every penny I spent on it.Pros0 Heavy duty, will last forever0 Well designed by pros so that you really can see it is for everyday use0 Spoiler alert: spoils the user so that you can no longer do without!!Cons0 Little pricey compared to tighthening clampsConclusionI agree with other reviewers: this is a MUST HAVE tool. Not a nice to have. I cannot imagine having to put a floor in without this combined wiht my pneumatic nailer. You might need more than 1 to be even more efficient, but 1 is sufficient if need be. Pro installers that do this for a living probably use more than 1.LOVE IT.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10H1HC4J9B7JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000224PZ#wasThisHelpful","R10H1HC4J9B7JG","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background you can skipI bought this set for myself and my kids so that we could play in the yard. I had seen the Carlton set for about 35$ in a store and did not like the quality of the rackets and the wobbly poles so I decided to buyt the slightly more expensive Salaun set, for 15 to 20 bucks more.About this setIt did not disappoint. The set came, like most other sets, in a plastic carrying bag and was complete:- 6 rackets of which 4 regular size and 2 short, in 4 distinct colors and made of aluminium- Net (poly)- Poles (steel)- Pole fasteners (to pull the net tight)with ground spikes- 3 nylon shuttles in a container- carrying bagThe rackets are very decent quality, certainly one grade up from the 7$ steel throw-away stuff. These are actually nice looking, very lightweight (aluminum) and durable. The string is tight and, again, these are worth the extra money over the Carlton set I looked at.The net was relatively easy to set up and I liked the fact it was set with steel poles. Doesn't mean it won't break if you manhandle it but certainly more durable than pvc.By the way, I posted a bunch of pics so you can look at the parts.Pros- Decent quality that will make this set last- Complete with 6 rackets and everything else you needCons- Little tricky to get the net right. Best thing would be a permanent net with poles set in concrete. These poles are always a little tricky with the tension cords but once set up they should stand up through the summer if you wanted to.Setting it up a few times will make it easier though. Minus one star for that but all sets will have that flaw.Final thoughtsHe/She who finds a simpler solution to the netting gets 5 stars. Consider buying a separate net solution if you are looking for something more permanent but if that is the case I recommend spending the 200$ or so for a semi-pro setup anyways. For your run of the mill home use this is perfect. With so many rackets it is a good party set.If you have the room in your yard or lots of wind interference consider buying a simplet Speedminton set. Tougher, faster game and loads of fund. Goes for 30$.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9OL5L5OG3N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SEBLME#wasThisHelpful","RS9OL5L5OG3N1","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many (or only a few) years from now people will figure out that there is nothing healthy about eating stir fried food out of a non-stick coated Wok. How can it be? Non-Stick was not made for high heat and it is not good for using lots of utensils in.I tried them all, Stainless (horrible), aluminum (not so bad!), non-stick (cancerous), Cast Iron (wonderful) and Carbon (wonderful). The trick really is in the seasoning. If you have that down and you treat it the way it should be treated (I.e. no soap, no standing liquids, heat dry, rub in oil after use) then this wok will become your cheapest as well as favorite kitchen tool. Almost non-stick without chemicals!The have several sizes from the Wok Shop (THE BEST!!!) and this one has not disappointed. My most used size. I have mostly single handle (wood) but this larger size is best with the double hancle. I like the all steel as I sometimes reseason under the broiler and that is not so good with wood handles lest you cover them up.Pros:- Great size- Durable- Natural non-stickCons:- You need to get familiar with how to season and properly maintain (not alot of work, just a good Google search or read the Wok SHop instructions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4UNM4TO955W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00012F3HC#wasThisHelpful","R3J4UNM4TO955W","AIOPD46ZIV8K2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIOPD46ZIV8K2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thumb drives were all the rage several years ago, but it seemed as though technology nearly passed them by.  512mb, 2gb, and 4gb sticks seemed nearly irrelevant in the ever increasing world of large media files and rich documents.  Furthermore, early on, the prices for the minimal amount of storage was high. Sure, it worked well at replacing a Writable CD for temporary a files, but storage capacity and speed held the product back from offering much else.However, with some time, the flash drives began to catch up in cost and technology thereby ushering in brand new use cases for the tech. These Samsung drives are fast.  Indeed, if your computer supports USB 3.0 and your machine has an old fashioned spinning hard drive, this thumb drive will actually be faster than your internal drive.  Whatever the case, you will find that you can store, backup, and transfer much faster with a usb 3.0 drive.Samsung has also added some slick, shiny style to the product which is well appreciated.  I most like the value of the 64gb and 128gb capacities. Cloud storage and other internet transfer services may make a physical storage medium feel outdated, in many ways it is.  Still, there are use cases for these especially as they are now so fast and offer such high capacity levels.  Overall, recommended.  This is not the flash drive of ten years ago.  Nice job Samsung!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJD7YPI8ZR0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CCTJKE#wasThisHelpful","R1FJD7YPI8ZR0I","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a fan and or owner of Apple products, there is one thing certain.  At least once a day the time will come to charge your device or devices, which means you need a lightning cable.  While many complained about the move to the lightning cable in Fall 2012, the reversibility of the connector and size has proved successful.I simply can never have enough lightning cables and Belkin has a great offering here.  This company has a long history of making Mac and other Apple accessories, so they always deliver a quality job.  The ends of the cable, cable itself, etc. are all of acceptable and durable quality.In particular, I have been using the ten foot option.  While this seemed quite large and surprised me when I opened the box, Belkin offers this size in case your USB port or outlet are that bit further from your desk or night table.  Passengers in the rear of a vehicle without an outlet in the second row might also benefit from the extended length.Overall, Belkin is a brand that can be trusted to deliver a quality third party accessory for your Apple device.  Now on top of that, they are offering varying lengths of cables, to fit the exact situation you need to meet.  I'm always in favor of pricing coming down for a relatively simple cable, but I recommend this cable if you need another lightning to USB solution!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3HKD7YEQS68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06DTM#wasThisHelpful","R1M3HKD7YEQS68","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lenox Pierced Lit Penguin Ornament is a quality, affordable holiday keepsake.In today's world, it seems the things that make an impact on people are becoming more and more expensive.  Ornaments that cost triple digits and are not actually hung on a tree seems to be a popular pastime for those diehard holiday collecting types with the bank notes to support it.However, sometimes you find a little gem that is for the rest of us, affordable, but makes an impact on us and brings that childhood like smile to our faces.This Lenox ornament is to that level of quality collectible.  The piercing in the china, the stars, are of beautiful dimension and quality.  You want to reach out and touch the stars.  The face and scarf have subtle yet expressive detail.  It put a great smile on my face as well as the children who saw it when I opened it.  Indeed, it has gotten me in the spirit to make sure we begin our decorating, on time, in the coming weeks.Even the tassel is of good quality, and the battery lighting feature was a surprise delight.  It adds very little weight too.  The ornament is not one of those that are so heavy you will never find a branch, considering the lighting feature is included, the weight is just right.Overall, Lenox creates rememberable and quality products, in an affordable category.  This Pierced Lit Penguin Ornament I hope will be in our family's traditions for decades to come.

"There are many choices when it comes to beard and hair trimmers.  Panasonic is quickly becoming a popular choice with their latest offerings.The ER-GB60-K will not disappointment with many fantastic features.  Firstly, there are two attachments, one for beard and one for the hair on your head.  Snap the comb on, and then further select the ""just right,"" length by rotating the manual selection on the front of the unit.  It works well and feels of quality.The built in battery is of the latest technology.  A relatively short charge, just over a hour, gives you a full battery of trimming with fifty minutes (or more based on my use) before needing to be charged once again.One drawback is the small storage pouch included with the unit.  It only fits the trimmer itself.  The charging cable, comb attachments, and cleaning brush do not fit.  And why is the cleaning brushes always so easy to lose and/or drop?  I did not even have the trimmer out of the package, and I dropped the cleaning brush. Be careful! ha. Oh, you also need to store the small bottle of mineral oil included to lubricate the trimmer. So many little things to store! You can also rinse the end of the trimmer with water, though to really cling out the gunk, I would always want to use the small brush too.Both attachments for beard and hair work as you would expect.  Nevertheless, for serious, thick hair trimming I would always choose a unit with full AC wall power.  These cordless units do not have power for thick hair, though short hair as shown in the images here on Amazon should work well.Overall this is quality unit and surely you will have a trimming need that it will satisfy.  Thanks Panasonic.  I'd recommend this trimmer should you be in the search for one and the features meet your demands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBO2081CC1AI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3A1X0S#wasThisHelpful","RBO2081CC1AI5","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is absolutely true!  It seems our lives are tied more and more to our chargers!  We have to charge just about everything these days, toothbrushes, shavers, remote controls, computers, tablets, and of course, the cannot live without smart phone.The Belkin BSV300ttCW 3-outlet wall mount candle is a great solution to plug in at least some of those electronic devices.  Our family is sharing this to take care of our iPhones.  The two USB ports are terrific, and it is a fast charge versus a USB connected to your computer.  Furthermore, we have used the traditional outlets below the USB ports to charge portable bluetooth speakers, worked great.Overall, the Belkin 3-outlet wall mount cradle is great in that it takes one of your wall outlets and turns it into a 3-outlet with the bonus of two USB ports ready to go.  What's not to love about that?  Well, only one thing.  When inserted in the wall, the device doesn't leave you with the greatest sense of security.  It is fairly large to be supported by the one outlet in the back.  Therefore, we certainly do not use the cradle groove on top of the device for storing our phone.  We simply plug in the USB and sit the phone on the counter below the Belkin device, no worries.We have also used it to charge an iPad, and that works great too.Overall, Belkin tries to deliver quality in its aftermarket accessories.  The appearance and style is of top marks too and will maintain the elegance of your latest gadgets with its modern look.  For the most part, they hit that high quality mark once again. Recommended if you are short on charging space and/or outlets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICRYVGONCL6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1AKB2C#wasThisHelpful","RICRYVGONCL6S","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vornado is quickly becoming a recognized brand in small home cooling and heating.  Just step into your local discount department store or corner drugstore!  You will likely find Vorando products on the shelf.This latest offering, the Tornado VH202 Personal Space Heater in Black delivers an extremely compact unit that offers both personal space heating ability, but also a fan function for those warmer months.I love the size as I can choose to place it either on my desk or underneath it, to keep the feet nice and warm.  Depending on your workplace policy, the unit is small enough that many will choose to take it to work to brave those cold months, or provide some air movement via the fan function in the summer.  The heat put out by the unit in heating mode is impressive, and the fan helps move that warm air throughout your personal space.One caveat for me with any personal space heater that includes a fan is listening to that very fan.  It creates a white noise that some may find comforting, but I find distracting.  I end up feeling as though I cannot hear the rest of my surroundings comfortably when the unit is running.Overall, the Vorando VH202 performs its duty well.  It is compact which makes its placement nearly limitless.  Nevertheless, the fan that helps move the air through your space bothers me after some time.  I actually prefer to work across the room from the unit.  While it doesn't directly reach me at that distance, I enjoy going over to it for some breaks and quick recovery from the chill.  Recommended product, especially if you don't mind the sound of the fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RSNLRJUBGORK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXEJ6PC#wasThisHelpful","R1RSNLRJUBGORK","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AHAVA Essential Day Moisturizer is a luxury moisturizer and the company puts an emphasis on their commitment against animal testing as well as leaving a positive impact on the environment.  AHAVA commitment to using natural, many plant-based or naturally deposited mineral ingredients gives you an impression that they are Israel's version of Aveda.  Nevertheless, AHAVA's stance on animal testing and use of non-animal ingredients is even more reassuring than Aveda, because AHAVA clearly puts no animal testing right on its packaging, whereas Aveda has removed such language due to their parent, Estee Lauder.  In terms of quality, AHAVA products are of that luxury tier of skin care just as much as Aveda.When it comes to the product itself, we loved AHAVA Time to Hydrate Essential Day Moisturizer.  The moisturizer is rich, but not greasy.  It truly hydrates the skin, but does so in a beautifully, healthy, tactful process, without leaving the skin greasy or uncomfortable.  The product's moisture appears to last hours rather than a hour.What's great too is that AHAVA has many other products, from eye creams, SPF creams, night creams, masks, and the list goes on.  It's terrific that there is a skin care company that is free of animal testing and free of animal-derived ingredients and yet delivers in each product category.  That is how it should be!  Plus, the bonus that many of the products come all the way from Israel, that is a cool factor as well.  Thanks AHAVA, your products are high quality, and your animal policy is appreciated.

Truly, ever wonder why your cookies or other baked goods never come out quite right?  You're pre-heating, following your recipe to the letter, and it's still not quite right?  Parchment paper may be the final secret you're missing.  Reynolds Cookie Baking Sheets aim to make using parchment paper for baking easier as you are provided 22 pre-cut sheets to simply unfold and lay on your baking sheet.  They work as well as any parchment paper and they are fairly convenient.The one negative is the quantity compared to a roll of parchment.  The best deal is at Costco and Sam's Club who have their store brand, yet genuine French made parchment paper, that comes in simply gigantic rolls for not much more than one of these small boxes of pre-cut sheets.  The pre-cut sheets are cool, but they are not worth the extra expense.Our family uses parchment paper for everything.  Essentially, there is not one item that goes into our oven that doesn't have parchment paper below it.  Not only does it prevent burning, but it keeps your pans clean!  Whether you're baking a cake (cut out a circle for your cake pans), heating some left overs, etc. parchment paper is how we begin any baking session.  Parchment recommended!  These pre-cut sheets?

I would like to point out to any potential buyers that the file's thickness is on the compact size.  Therefore, even as it expands, it's capacity is fairly limited.

"WeMo F5Z0598 Osram Lightify Gardenspot Mini RGP Starter Set is one of the most impressive outdoor landscaping items I have come across.The product is of a high build quality.  The wiring and end caps that seal off the extension are solid and truly built for outdoor weather.  You get a sense from holding and installing the product that it will be a part of your outdoor landscaping for many years to come.Second, setup of Wi-Fi controlled devices doesn't always go smoothly.  However, the included WeMo and Osram Lightify Gardenspot were up and running in minutes!  It just works!  Furthermore, I quickly picked my favorite custom color for the lights and assigned them to light at sunrise and sunset each day.  How cool is that?  No matter the season, the lights will always come on at exactly the right time.  Brilliant.The light output is significant for LEDs.  Indeed, there is an included brightness control in the WeMo app and some may want to take advantage of that.  These shine brightly.  I have lined one of my garden areas, and I am already searching my property for the next best place to install another set.  Of course, I am somewhat constrained by where I can get power to plug them in, but I can see adding more Lightly Gardenspot sets in the future.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by this kit combining the easy of use of WeMo features and Osram Lightly Gardenspot quality.

Therefore, when we first started to get lightning connector devices, we did not have the ""easy to find,"" and ""easy to grab,"" cables lying around as we did the previous generation connector.Therefore, it's great that third parties offer quality, nice looking lightning cables in many different lengths.  I have been impressed by this cable.  Indeed, one of our first genuine Apple cables began to show its age, so I actually switched to this Belkin one as the primary unit for my phone.  It just works, and it works great.  Belkin always delivers high quality aftermarket products that rival OEM Apple in terms of quality.  They have a lot of experience and expertise in making ""Made for..."" products so you know they will perform well and Apple certifies them.It's great to grab a shorter one like this, if you want to reduce clutter on your desk, or inside your vehicle.  After all, it's best to have a cable anywhere and everywhere.My only gripe is a small one.  Yes, the cable looks great, blends with Apple products, has a nice feel, and performs flawlessly.  However, for an aftermarket cable, I find the price just a tad steep.  Still, if you need a lightning cable or two, I recommend this one.  Thanks Belkin!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALX8LJ9RB0LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVY0S9U#wasThisHelpful","R3ALX8LJ9RB0LH","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Portable, compact hard drives have been a popular market for several years now.  The reason being that no matter how much storage your computer came with from the factory, including notebooks that often have smaller hard drive or SSD drives, a portable hard drive allows you massive storage with a simple USB cable.USB 3 has made it that much better.  If your PC or Mac is equipped with USB 3, the speeds at which the transfers occur is nearly as fast as an internally mounted hard drive.  Furthermore, this particular drive is also targeted towards Xbox One users who want to quickly plug in additional storage.Overall, the drive is impressive.  2 TB of storage is fantastic.  I am using it as a Time Machine backup for one of my Macs, and it will be several months before my machine begins the need to delete any of the backups as this is a lot of storage.  Terrific.  Yes, of course, the drive isn't specifically targeted at Macs, but I simply formatted it in Disk Utility, and it works flawlessly.Many suggest the drive is designed for ""gaming,"" but in truth it's marketed towards gaming.  It will be great as an external USB 3 drive whether with your PC, Mac, or Xbox One.  Recommended Product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1956F5MMSHEZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7RJCD6#wasThisHelpful","R1956F5MMSHEZZ","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon Echo was introduced to many of us with an informative email from Amazon.  It sounded interesting.  A speaker that you talk to, and that talks back to you.  However, how would it work?The excitement as I waited the weeks until the delivery was quite high, but even I was surprised just how useful Amazon Echo would be.  On first impressions, Echo was smaller than I expected, which allowed it to be placed in a small nook in a useful spot between kitchen and living room.  It looks great and the light ring is slick.  Tricky math calculations, weather around the world, wikipedia searches, and the list goes on.  Our family regularly uses Echo for these situations.  Furthermore, the most used feature is music.  Prime music has such a great library as well as all your Amazon purchased music being a quick voice request away is fantastic. So often, pulling out your phone to send music to a speaker, or finding just the right radio channel can be more tiresome than you think.  Our family, if we have to go through those extra steps, will simply go without music.However, if we need some gentle background tunes, Amazon Echo gets it playing it mere seconds, with minimum effort.  The sound quality is acceptable.  Some music obviously sounds better than others, but it is all acceptable, and enjoyable.  And if you do want to take the time to get your phone out, Amazon Echo works as a great bluetooth speaker too.Echo's voice detection is superb.  It never misses the ""Alexa,"" keyword and is ready to go instantly. Furthermore, it picks up your requests quite well.  However, if you're listening to music on a high level, it might be difficult for Echo to hear you.Overall, during the past several months, Echo has earned a permanent spot in our home.  It has a great design, reliably adds a usefulness to our daily lives, and is a lot of fun too.  Amazon did a superb job with Echo, and we are anxious to see other Echo products in the future!  Highly recommended product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FE6I7QPO75OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R1FE6I7QPO75OE","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alba Botanica has several beautifully engineered products.  Terrific shampoo and conditioner, solid moisturizers, and a nice face cleanser.  They have many SPF sunscreen products as well.This product, for a sunscreen, has an acceptable smell.  It is less off-putting than many sunscreens.  It feels ok on the skin for being such a high SPF, and it seems to work very well.  I believe as a spray-on sunscreen, the product would work well for most people.Nevertheless, one of the major aspects that I found attractive of Alba Botanica was the fact they have 100% Vegetarian Ingredients and not tested on animals.  This is probably true for the Alba Botanica labeled products.However, Alba Botanica is only a brand of the Hain Celestial Group.  Alba Botanica does not seem to be its own company, just a brand of Hain Celestial.  The problem is Hain Celestial also owns turkey and chicken meat brands.I have a problem spending money on ""vegetarian"" products when the same headquarters are profiting from animal slaughter.  Furthermore, while I cannot vouch for the authenticity, I read an online blog of a partnership Hain has in Asia, and that company may or may not test on animals, it was not clear.  In other words, Hain is a very large company and much more than a vegetarian personal care products company.Overall, Alba Botanica has some beautifully engineered products.  However, it's simply a line or brand from Hain Celestial which makes my stomach uneasy. Our family plans to use up the Alba Botanica products remaining in our home, and then move elsewhere. Kiss My Face might be one option.  A second option is 100% Pure brand.  Both have very capable products.  Perhaps, someday, Alba Botanica could be spun off into its own company or purchased by someone else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYPFXJC5BN4JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB84IRU#wasThisHelpful","RYPFXJC5BN4JN","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Metrokane Rabbit Valvet Champagne Opener Set is yet another quality product from the wine accessory brand.  Champagne and/or sparkling wine is great for celebrating special occasions.  Surely, the perfect bottle of champagne is not too difficult to open by hand, but what about that stubborn bottle and what about looking a bit more elegant at that dinner party next week?  Enter the Metrokane Champagne Opener Set.The pliers are beautifully constructed to perfection and give you just the right grip to pull the cork with ease.  I cannot get over the quality of the pliers.  The cost of this item truly lies in the pliers as you can tell between the price of the individual pliers versus the price of the set.  For a wine accessory, the pliers look great!  There is a nice heft to them.However, despite the set focus being on the pliers, do not understate the sealer!  I love the sealer, and it is the item from the set that I use that much more regularly.  Terrific to lock in the great flavor, at least for a day.  Just be careful upon releasing the sealer as there is a lot of pressure that builds up in the bottle, and that sealer is NOT as gentle as a cork.  Follow the directions to the letter and be careful when opening.Recommended product.  Thanks Metrokane.  I'm enjoying this product in my home!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GA47JSRPIYIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOQ2Y56#wasThisHelpful","R2GA47JSRPIYIR","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Swingline High Heel Stapler with 20 Sheet Capacity brings a bit of personality to your office desk.  The product is sure to make an interesting gift for those who want a stapler just a bit out of the ordinary.  It is offered at an affordable price too.Besides the design, one key feature is that the stapler is always upright.  This makes it easy to grab and staple your documents while taking up a minimal amount of desk space.  A traditional stapler is long, lays flat and takes up more of a footprint, no pun intended, on the desk.  This stapler, just grab, staple, and you're good to go.  There are no awkward moments trying to align your sheets of paper just right as in the traditional horizontal staplers either.  Grab the shoe in hand, and align it right where you want it on your documents.  It truly is easy and fast. It's light, so it all is very easy to accomplish.Downsides?  The stapler does come in at a very attractive price, and the quality, while it has performed admirably thus far in our home, feels somewhat cheap. It feels like a just north of ten dollar stapler.  Still, if your stapling quantity is low to average, you might just to add the style and ease of use of the Swingline High Heel Stapler at your desk!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYI1YRR31W66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMDYURI#wasThisHelpful","R1QYI1YRR31W66","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula Fresh Breath Toothpaste has a lot going for it on paper.  I love that it is vegan, cruelty free, and that it includes awesome ingredients like Xylitol, while also packing fluoride to prevent tooth decay.The toothpaste delivered its breath freshening promise.  After just a couple applications, I found my breath was that much fresher and stayed fresher, longer.The downside?  I did not enjoy the product as a regular toothpaste replacement.  The product is very viscous, with very little obvious polishing effect.  I felt as though I was brushing with water, the mixture wanting to run out of my mouth much more easily than a traditional toothpaste.  It felt messy and difficult to use.  Furthermore, my teeth were left feeling as though they weren't brushed very well.  I felt nearly like I had used a world class mouthwash, but still needed to brush my teeth.  I did not like that.Needless to say, after a couple uses, I have not wanted to use the product again.  It has some terrific ingredients and does seem to keep your breath fresh, longer.  Nevertheless, I want a toothpaste that leaves my teeth feeling clean and has some polishing action.  Perhaps, over time, I could implement it a few times a week, before a traditional toothpaste brushing.  However, it all seems like a bit too much work if, like me, you don't find the product can replace your regular toothpaste.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QLND1ZJKR2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFU5GXG#wasThisHelpful","R30QLND1ZJKR2L","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scotts Turf Builder Zoysia Grass Seed is a great product in intense southern climates. While this seed, unlike other Scotts products does not come with the seeds coated in a water retaining coating, it does have the best formula of nutrients and seed to get you on the way to a nice lawn in the right climate.Many experiment with Zoysia in other climates such as Los Angeles with some success, a major complaint from most growers of Zoysia is in certain climates, its tendency to turn quite yellow in the winter.

It won't make it through the summer, but I'm certainly enjoying it now.  It's a beautiful grass, and a great all around product from Scotts.  Scotts goal is to put everything you need in the bag.

"Aether Cone - The Thinking Music Player puts a twist on listening to music. It combines a never seen form factor, unique interface, internet music subscription option, and good sound.First, the design of the Aether Cone is what draws many in at first.  It arrives in a brown, clamshell box with a simple, easy to slide off cover.  The entire unboxing experience reminds you of an Apple product of ten years ago.  Special.Once you unwrap the cone from its drawstring bag, you will be impressed by the small size and quality finish of the product.  The black plastic is high quality, while the copper cap is unique.  The cone shape makes sense.  The cone stands easily. The cone shape and copper allude subtly to a Zonophone of a century ago, while packing the latest technology inside.  If you want an unique look, but not distracting or out of place, the highly advertised copper black is perfect.  For the ultimate, ""match all my Apple products look,"" the silver and white would be a fine choice too.The interface is very unique on the Aether cone.  You setup the cone over Wi-Fi. I tried with my mobile browser, and the setup failed.  I tried via FireFox on my Mac, and it worked.Once you're running with an Aether Account and your cone is connected to Wi-Fi, you have access to free Rdio radio stations with commercials.  I honestly did not hear very much music I knew or enjoyed in the 30 minutes I played with the device on free radio.  Therefore, I upgraded to Rdio premium from Aether's website.  This included a one month free trial before the $10.00 monthly billing begins.Once on premium, I can say after the push of a button ""Play songs by Artist...""  Or ""play the album.....by .......""  It works great.  In those two scenarios it will continue to play the album and or artist.  However, not every artist is understood by the voice recognition. For example, ""play songs by artist Norah Jones,"" did not play Norah Jones to the others members of my household's disappointment.  If you say just a song name, the Cone will hopefully find that song, and then play similar songs.  Very main strain and Hit 100 songs have much more sensible songs played after them than the less common genres.To make the requests I mentioned above, simply place your finger in the middle of the cone's front button, it's a sensor not a physical button, wait for the tone to chime, and speak the request.  Selections may also be made from the Aether application which is only available for iOS at this time.  The other buttons on the device are a volume up and down in copper finish (silver on the white Cone), power switch in the back, and the outer ring that allows you to cycle through an album or similar songs with a small turn of the ring, or change to a different artist or genre with a large turn of the ring.The functionality and interface is good.  It could be better, but its different and fun.  One of the largest complaints is that Rdio is the only source right now.  I would like to see SiriusXM stations added as well as Amazon Music, Beats Music, etc.  Still, Rdio is a good source for content on the premium subscription, the problem is if it is not already something you subscribe to, it creates an additional expense on a $400 device.  In three years, you will nearly double the cost of the speaker by subscribing to Rdio Premium. Perhaps, at $400, a year of Rdio premium could be included?If you have an iOS device, you can Airplay content to the speaker, but this adds a step that I do not like.  I prefer to simply request and pull up songs directly on the speaker from Rdio.Finally, the sound quality is very good.  This speaker is not huge.  While you can carefully hold it in one hand, it fills two entire palms.  Considering this smallish size, the sound quality is very good.  At the right distance and angle from the cone, some songs are simply terrific. Vocals and bass are particularly good for the size.  Still, this won't serve more than a room and there is no audio output to feed the sound to another speaker or audio system.One of the great features is the built-in battery.  There is no reason to keep the speaker tied to one location in your home.  Firstly, the size makes it possible to move from room to room, while the built in battery provides up to 8 hours of wireless operation.  Considering the volume level I have used the speaker, the battery performance has surprised me.  It works great.Overall, Aether Cone The Thinking Music Player is unique and a lot of fun.  I opened the Cone on Christmas Day and despite the slight initial connectivity hiccups and fairly regular voice recognition failure, it was a very fun item to use and learn about today.  I plan to keep my Cone for a long time, lets just hope some more audio choices are added to ease the dependability on Rdio premium, a good service, just expensive when you already pay for other music services.  The Cone team made a great functioning, oh so unique and special design, and good sounding speaker.  There is not anything like it out there.  The value for each user is different, many will find the device expensive, it's not a impulse purchase, but it is unique and if you have a use case in your home or office, there is little reason not to consider this very carefully engineered and special Aether Cone.  Hopefully, Aether will keep making it better!

"Metrokane has long offered solid performing wine accessories.  The Metrokane 4043 Rabbit Wing Corkscrew carries on that reliable heritage.I have used Metrokane's original Rabbit Corkscrew for years now.  That product has an unusual design that makes opening a bottle of wine as simple as a push and pull of a lever.  It is 100 percent full proof.With the introduction of the 4043 winged product, Metrokrane has a corkscrew that is less than half of the price of their most revered product.  While it is not quite as easy as the more premium product, I like it.Firstly, like the traditional Rabbit corkscrew, the 4043 uses gears to take out some of the work for you.  After you screw the spiral into the cork with the large easy to grasp handle, you push down on the levers.  These levers take your energy and simplifies the process of nearly full-proofing the removal of the cork from the bottle.  Therefore, the product works great.Secondly, there is one edge I give to this entry level corkscrew.  The traditional Rabbit corkscrew can look bulky, large, and untraditional.  It works great, but in front of fellow wine aficionados, there is sometimes something about a traditional corkscrew that feels more right  While this 4043 product is more advanced than a traditional corkscrew, its look and feel is closer to what one expect's of a corkscrew, you still get to screw the spiral into the cork, which you do not get to do on the original and more expensive Rabbit.The only downside is that this product is slightly slower and cumbersome compared to the more premium product, and it is not as quick to eject the cork from the spiral after removing it from the bottle.Overall, Metrokane realizes that several corkscrews helps them offer a product for all price points and wine aficionado status.  This is a recommend product as it will make removing corks simple, while still giving you some traditional corkscrew touches.  It is not, however, as revolutionary and wow-factor as the original Metrokane Rabbit Corkscrew.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGIR50XFZKGNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPV2I2#wasThisHelpful","RGIR50XFZKGNK","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TCP RLA1550ND LED A21 100 Watt Equivalent light bulb is a solid product for your serious lighting needs.  It may look similar to a traditional light bulb, but this is actually a high tech piece of kit.The bulb comes to your door ready to install in any traditional bulb socket you need this level of light output.  Simply open the box, unscrew your old bulb, and screw in the new one.The savings over a traditional bulb is significant, while the savings over a CFL is much more limited. Still, the LED bulbs last longer than CFL, so that takes some headaches out of home lighting maintenance.  You will not save a lot of electricity if you are upgrading from a CFL, but if you already need a new bulb, you might as well choose a terrific LED product like this one, particularly in sockets that are used on a daily basis where the savings add up quicker.I installed the product in a socket that is on nearly five hours per day.  Therefore, I feel good that I am using a 15-watt LED bulb during those hours.I have one or two other LED bulbs in my home, while most others are CFL.  As the CFLs die out, I will move towards LED, because again, the light output is terrific, the longevity is superb, and it's the greenest bulb out there by far.Please note that this bulb is Non-Dimmable, so do not buy expecting that feature.  It might sound odd, but this bulb was really fun to install in my home.  It was the highest output LED bulb I have tried to date.

"Dixie's Disposable Cutting Boards are a great idea for connivence and sanitary reasons.Firstly, on a few occasions when being lazy, I have been known to use three or four paper plates, if I have them in my house, to use for cutting.  The problem is, besides being wasteful, they are too small.  Dixie caught on to consumers desire to use a disposable cutting surface and introduced these cutting boards.Effectively, they are simply a very large paper plate.  I have found only two drawbacks.  First, the surface is somewhat slippery.  Therefore, I have found several pieces of fruits and vegetables slide and fly across the room when cutting.  It is simply a nature of the surface, not a significant issue.Secondly, it would be great if the cutting boards came in a reasonable bag.  I carefully opened the edge of the bag, but if you want to keep your cutting boards sealed to keep dust and other contaminants away until the next use, there really isn't a way to do that.Overall, Dixie saw a market for a product that people were already improvising in a less efficient way.

"Canon's MAXIFY MB2320 Wireless Home Office Inkjet Printer is representing a sweet spot in Canon's new office and home office line.MAXIFY aims not at students nor your average home user.  All MAXIFY products aim at business users, no matter if you have a sizable office, cozy office, or home office.  There are also home users who demand the refinement and reliability of an office-capable machine.  MAXIFY offers several models in the lineup that hit different price points.This MB2320 is the top of the home office segment (there are three machines in the full office segment positioned above).You should make no mistake about the capabilities and power of the MB2320.  A multifunction unit at this price point has likely never offered the speed, quality, features, and shear duty cycle previously.  Indeed, I have not been this excited to setup and use a printer in a very long time.  It is an impressive unit.The machine is not small.  It is larger than home/consumer all in ones, no question, but not so much larger to be a bother.  The lines and the aesthetics are pleasant to look at, so I do not mind placing the machine in my home office.  It may not have the looks of a new MacBook Pro, but as a printer, it looks good.  The plastics on the device, while hard, have a texture and weight a step higher than you typically see at this price point.  Craftsmanship is therefore better than expected.The speed of the unit impresses me, especially ""Quick First Print.""  I print from a different room than the printer.  With my previous units, I could walk into the other room, and I would still be waiting on the printing to begin.  With the MB2320, I walk into the other room and I have not one page printed, but my entire three page document.  The speed blows me away at this price point.  Plus, double sided printing isn't much slower and I have yet to have it hang up. This machine simply works.As I use the MB2330 with Macs, the printer driver worked automatically out of the box.  AirPrint works seamlessly from my iPhone and iPad too when connected to the same network as the printer, double sided printing works from the iOS devices too.The two paper trays are terrific.  Keep envelopes in one, always ready, or photo paper, or letterhead, the options are endless.  I keep the second tray filled with 200 sheets of standard paper, and I never have to remove it, as I can use tray 1 for any specialities I might need as listed above.Print quality?  The black is terrific.  For an inkjet printer, the text documents I have printed, all on ""standard,"" setting with plain paper, look as good as I have ever seen inkjet.  You will not be disappointed with the text quality.  I printed a quick photograph.  It's acceptable, a photo enthusiast will always choose a photo printer with several more ink colors.  The ink in a business machine is designed for text documents first.The printer supports OneDrive, DropBox, and Google Drive out of the box.One of the most impressive aspects of the machine is its shear personality.  It is a serious printing machine.  There is not much you ask it to do that is going to disappoint you.  I am not dealing with jams, odd errors, nor any other issues.  The printer works, and it's 15,000 pages per month duty cycle means in a 20 day work month, your office could print 750 pages a day and be within the limits of the machine.  Canon also touts its US based support that comes with all Maxify printers, but I have not needed support.Overall, Canon has delivered a very high end home office printing solution.  Serious printing can be accomplished on this machine, and I believe many workplace offices would do quite well with one or two of these units too.  It should not be limited exclusively to home offices despite its positioning in the MAXIFY lineup.  My only question?  Canon states it is bringing down printing costs on these business units as they are likely to be used for a higher quantity of printing.  The XL cartridges do look to have a large capacity.  Furthermore, Canon includes Standard cartridges with the printer, rather than ""Trial"" size.  These standard units are not nearly as good as XL, but it won't run out after 25 pages either as a trial cartridge will.  Still, $70-$75 for a complete set of ink, color and black in XL size, is expensive, nearly half the unit price.  I am not certain how many users want to spend that on ink if printing high demand office needs.  Still, the product works so well, if the cartridges come down just a bit, I can't see giving up the MAXIFY MB2320.  Recommended Product!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24B0AWZH34TLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNVDPUK#wasThisHelpful","R24B0AWZH34TLN","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roxio's Toast Titanium 12 for Mac is the latest release in the series of disc authoring programs.  I have been using Toast since version 7.  The product originally intended to simplify disc authoring.  It is still great at this.  From a myriad of video formats, Toast will allow you to burn the disc in many ways.  Perhaps, you want the data written to the disc untouched, no problem.  Perhaps, you want the video files you drag into Toast converted to a DVD format to play on any DVD player, no problem. Toast will convert it, and then burn a DVD video disc.With each addition Toast aims to add  more features.  What's the latest features?  Social media components continue to be added.  Upload content right to Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo, and Twitter.  Plus, there is a great new screen caption feature, to capture video straight from your screen.  The possibilities are endless for creating videos and presentations whether for work, school, or play.Plus, with traditional media, i.e. discs becoming ever less popular, the product is now marketed as ""The ultimate digital media toolkit.""  Toast will convert your video files, perhaps from your digital camcorder as an example, to formats to play back easily on your iPad, iPhone, or Apple TV.Essentially, when you are going to be working with media on your computer, needing to author a disc, share media content, copy your home video file, or do conversion of the content, Toast wants to be what you turn to first.It's a capable product.  It simplifies many of these tasks, while some are slightly less polished.  The argument others may make is that you can do many of the things that toast offers with free utilities and built in OS X features.  However, Toast brings it all together in Toast 12 Titanium.  You may just find it is easier to get what you need done, without the need to go searching for other software by turning once again to Toast.  I know I continue to enjoy the product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJMXW6NFFVGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L64Q6SE#wasThisHelpful","R3AJMXW6NFFVGT","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kobi Electric 10-watt (60 watt equivalent) Omni Directional LED light bulb is a terrific product.  It may look similar to a traditional light bulb, but this is actually a high tech piece of kit.The bulb comes to your door ready to install in any traditional bulb socket.  Simply open the box, unscrew your old bulb, and screw in the new one.The savings over a traditional bulb is significant, while the savings over a CFL is minimal.  Nevertheless, the LED bulbs last even longer than CFL, so that takes some headaches out of home lighting maintenance.  You won't save a lot of electricity if you're upgrading from a CFL, but if you already need a new bulb, you might as well choose a terrific LED product like this one, particularly in sockets that are used on a daily basis.I actually installed the bulb in a socket that I must run 24 hours  day.  Therefore, I feel good that I am using a 10-watt LED bulb.I have one or two other LED bulbs in my home, while most others are CFL.  As the CFLs die out, I will move towards LED, because again, the light output is terrific, the longevity is superb, and it's the greenest bulb out there by far.Kobi touts the ability to dim the bulb compared to CFL, and I tested this feature.  Yet another way we can get greener now, since most dimming situations can now use an energy efficient bulb.  It might sound odd, but this bulb was really fun to receive and install in my home.  Recommended product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151WE89Q95BNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHN5476#wasThisHelpful","R151WE89Q95BNP","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ACDelco's 94R AGM battery features equal performance of batteries you will find at the local auto parts stores.  I purchased this battery to install in family's Mercedes-Benz C Class.  That vehicle uses a 94R size battery, therefore, this battery fit perfect.  The original battery was not AGM, but the AGM technology allowed the battery to be shipped to my door, and I love that convenience.  Furthermore, with the recent Amazon coupon, the battery was nearly half of the cost of the AGM battery at local parts stores, and it was nearly as much cheaper than the non-AGM batteries.Only time will tell how long the battery will last.  The venting hole, case, etc. all fit perfectly in the vehicle.  A perfect fit, it starts the vehicle up beautifully, and it shows strong voltage.The battery was manufactured only two months prior to delivery, so it is nice and fresh.I compared all the 94R AGM batteries that the parts stores sell online, and they all have identical specs, therefore I came to the conclusion that the 94R AGM must be manufactured by the same company in the USA and sold under the various brands. Now, there are differences at the parts store in non-AGM 94R batteries, but the AGM varieties all appeared to be the same in this size as of this writing.The 94R battery size is used in various vehicles from Mercedes-Benz to Camaro.  The AGM technology is more stable when subjected to vibration.  This feature may not be needed in your road car.  Some vehicles require AGM batteries, when the battery is installed in the cabin, for example, under a seat.  Upgrading from a standard flooded battery to AGM is not necessary, in some cases, it may not last as long as heat can be detremental to AGM in a hot engine bay.  Nevertheless, in the Mercedes-Benz model I installed the product, the battery compartment, while in the engine bay, is somewhat isolated, protected by aluminum and receives some air from the cabin's ventilation system that circulates just above the battery.Overall, while this AC Delco 94R AGM battery appears equal to the 94R AGM batteries you may find at the local parts stores, the price blew me away at Amazon with recent coupon.  I have my fingers crossed the battery will last through the warranty period as I truly have no idea how you would utilize the warranty if you do not have AC Delco battery retailer near you. Amazon will likely not want to take the battery back after 30 days.  This should be clarified in the product information.I would recommend the battery for applications requiring a 94R AGM battery.  Furthermore, if you don't mind switching to AGM technology, which has both pros and cons (a big pro being that it is shippable to your door), the battery can work in other 94R application as well.  I am happy with my purchase due to the convenience and price. Thanks for offering this battery!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R95O0IV6NWTRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006N91C2M#wasThisHelpful","R95O0IV6NWTRD","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pennzoil Ultra is the company's top of the line motor oil.  Shell, parent company of Pennzoil, engineered this 5w-40 European Full Synthetic product to meet the tough European Specifications.  Indeed, you would be hard pressed to find a common late model gasoline European vehicle that is not covered by this product (always double check though).Its approvals include Mercedes-Benz 229.5, BMW LL-01, Porsche A40, Ferrari, Maserati, Fiat, VW 505.00, and VW 502.00.These specifications all speak to the quality of the product. In particular, Mercedes-Benz 229.5 (used in the majority of gasoline engine Mercedes cars the past decade) is particularly tough to meet.In normal operating conditions, when you have a European vehicle, an approved oil allows you to comfortably run the full oil change interval recommended by your manufacturer.  Some of these European manufacturers have very long oil change intervals, which is why the correct oil with a strong additive package is so very important.Due to licensing, very few products meet current Ferrari specifications in North America.  This is about your only choice if you have a Ferrari in North America (you must be very happy if you have that Ferrari), and that specification sets this product apart from its rival European products from Mobil and Castrol which do not meet Ferrari spec.  The technical specs are all impressive.  This product has a very low NOACK volatility and proper viscosity for the majority of European vehicles in most climates.This is a highly recommended product. Depending on price and your personal preferences, Mobil 1 0w-40 is another terrific option that meets most of the same specifications besides Ferrari, Maserati, and Fiat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGUTNH1PCD7W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006A49KJC#wasThisHelpful","RGUTNH1PCD7W4","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Castrol EDGE 0w-30 SPT Synthetic Motor Oil has been loved and raved about by European car owners for a decade now.  It is one of Castrol's premier products in that it meets so many tough European specifications including Mercedes-Benz 229.5, BMW LL-01, VW 505.00, and VW 502.00.These specifications all speak to the quality of the product. In particular, Mercedes-Benz 229.5 (used in the majority of gasoline engine Mercedes cars the past decade) is particularly tough to meet.The product has often been referred to as German Castrol because for many years it was produced in Germany.  Now, you may still find it made in Germany, but some cases are showing up from Belgium.  Rest assured, it is still the high quality product meeting the tough European specifications no matter where it is produced.The low pour point of this product, approximately -50 Degree Centigrade suggests it has a significant percentage of Group IV Synthetic base stock in its formulation. Group III base stock is also high quality today, but the fact remains that Castrol is putting very high quality ingredients into this premier product. Of course, the oil companies today never tell us the exact formulation, so we can only take best guesses. Nevertheless, it is clear that it is a high quality product no matter what base stock is used because it does officially meet the tough European specifications listed on the bottle.When you have a European vehicle and you use a motor oil that meets the manufacturer specifications, you can feel comfortable going to the full maintenance interval recommended by your manufacturer under normal conditions.This is a highly recommended product. Depending on price and your personal preferences, Mobil 1 0w-40 is another terrific option that meets the same specifications as well as a few additional ones.Note - This product seems similar to Castrol's new 0w-40 product.

"Firstly, EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf stomper is a pretty cool idea.  It is an unique item and would make a great extra gift for the holidays or a birthday.  You easily install it on a rake or other gardening tool's handle.  I even had a spare handle with no rake, so I do not always have to deal with the big orange foot near my shoulder while raking.The stomper effectively helps compact leaves, which saves you space and bags!  Some reviewers mentioned it's not great for plastic bags as you will go through the bag.  This is indeed very possible.  However, if the bag is large enough, I have still had some success using it.  Sure, ideally, it will work much better in large paper bags.Secondly, it depends on the type of debris you are trying to compact with the stomper in terms of the effectiveness. Some leaves and lawn debris simply compact better than others.  My leaves don't necessarily compact too much, but it's still useful.Overall, it's a very cool idea.  I'm glad it is on the market, and I am glad I own it.  I'm sure there are more uses for it too.  I know some people have mentioned compacting other forms of trash.  Neat item, sure it's not quite as effective as you would ideally want, but I would still recommend giving it a try!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35HLCYF9B75BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1CS5JQ#wasThisHelpful","R35HLCYF9B75BQ","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Remington's XR1370 Hyper Series Rotary Shaver offers a high, feel good in the hand build quality and styling at at mid-range price point.  Indeed, it seems Remington tries to put more features/style into products at each respective price points in an attempt to tackle the sales leader in the industry, Philips Norelco.They have delivered again.  You get lithium battery technology.  This is welcomed as you will find over the life of the shaver, the battery's runtime will remain more consistent than older battery technologies.  Plus, a quick 5 minute charge will provide enough power for a single shave.  Perfect in the moments you find your shaver's battery dead.Next, you will have fewer of those moments when you run out of charge as there is a digital runtime display.  Right on the front of the shaver, it displays the minutes remaining until the next charge.  You can plan ahead before you reach 0!The build quality is quite nice indeed for a Wet and Dry shaver.  There are chrome accents for style, but soft rubber grips, which feel good in the hand and prevents any slip in the wet.Finally, the stand is oh so clever.  While it holds the shaver upright on your a flat service, it also prevents the shaver from being accidentally switched on, if packed in a suitcase. Clever!The shave is quite acceptable for a rotary shaver in this category.  It is about what you would expect.  Not perfect, but very good.  The head design simply does not have that perfect, natural, feel to it, but overtime, it seems more natural.Overall, Remington packed in a lot of features and style at a good price.

One downside to that is the paper feeder.  I never love upright paper trays.  The paper gets dusty and takes up vertical space, but again it keeps the printer footprint down in size.  I always feel somewhat silly recommending units that do not have fax capability because if you're already putting the money down, fax capability is just a little bit more.This unit completely lacks fax functionality.  However, as a second printer, or perhaps you already have a fax machine, the machine could still work for you nicely.The quality of text printing for business documents is high quality. Indeed, this printer makes business document printing its priority with its sharp, crisp text. Pictures look nice, but not as nice as a dedicated photo printer (which are often more expensive and use additional color cartridges that you must buy in addition to the standard colors.You do get Apple AirPrint functionality to print right from your iPhone or iPad, when connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the printer. Setup is also easy in Mac OS X.  OS X gets all the necessary drivers, no extensive installation process is necessary.  It's also important to note that as machines push more towards wireless as the default, a USB cable is NOT included, but I truly have no need for one, nor will most users with Wi-Fi.Overall, if you need a a small scanner, printer, and copier this XP-610 may work for you.

"It is that never ending battle in our lives today: keeping those tech devices charged.  Smartphones, iPhones, iPods, iPads, cameras, etc. Where does it end?  It seems almost everything needs a charge these days.Furthermore, should you overuse your device or forget a charge at home, there is nothing quite as frustrating as heading out whether for work, travel, or play to find that your battery is low.  You don't want to be without your favorite tunes for the drive home, or without your phone's camera during that once in a decade road trip!  Tylt offers this dual USB port charging device to solve all these frustrations.I love it!  First, simplicity, plug it into your car's 12V power outlet and you instantly gain two USB ports, spaced appropriately away from each other.  With USB, simply plug the USB end of the cable that came with your device to the Tylt, and then the propriety end into your unit.  I like that.  No need to necessarily buy extra cables, since this simply gives you two USB ports.Furthermore, Tylt takes car USB charging to another level because you will no longer have to fight with your wife, children, or colleague for the use of the USB port in your car.  This gives you two!  One for you, and one for them!  What's not to like? I'm enjoying this product!

"I was very excited to get started packing my new Targus Pewter backpack for 16 inch notebook computers.  I have always found Targus products to be of high quality, and this is far from an exception.  Indeed, it's more than I expected.Firstly, the computer storage is there, it seems protective enough, though some will always find tucking your machine in a sleeve first to provide that bit extra care.  Next, even with the computer inserted, you still have room and pocket for an iPad or iPad-sized tablet device.  Perfect, if you need to take it all with you, you can with this backpack.  It doesn't end there, feel free to pack all the headphones, A/C adapters, or other little accessories you might need, you won't run out of room too fast.The shoulder straps are oh so comfortable, and the entire backpack is of very high quality and construction.  One weekend, I left the electronics at home, and actually packed some clothes.  It was not ideal, but I love the backpack that much, I use it for anything.Recommended product!  You will find many uses for this, but as a notebook and/or tablet backpack, it's hard to go wrong with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTERGIU9W6TG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGWNKVQ#wasThisHelpful","RTERGIU9W6TG8","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bank Heavy Duty Upright is a beast.  It is not the most gorgeous, but it's sturdy, solid, and capable, which makes it admirable.  Truly, a vacuum intended for commercial use, you might just find it lasts for decades.Firstly, a rather short assembly is required for the vacuum.  Sadly, my magnets arrived crumbling and not in place, so I have no idea exactly where they go or how I would even install them at this point, since most of them are in pieces.  The Bank company could package the vacuum with more protection in its box.Otherwise, once put together, the Vacuum is simple and oh so capable.  The trick is to have The Bank Heavy Duty on the highest level setting and lower it, one setting at a time, until you hear the unit begin to hum.  You then have the ideal setting for your carpet.Despite its beastly size and appearance, it's not too difficult to maneuver.  The performance?  I have been vacuuming nightly, and my carpet looks great.  Now, I would not say it is any better than my Dyson unit, but about as good with the durability of a commercial unit.  Truly, if you are a hotel, large business, etc. you need a vacuum that can be used all day, for years.  This would be the machine for such an application.  In the home, there are consumer products that are cooler looking, contain nifty features, and do an equally good job in performance.In terms of filtration, a HEPA bag is included.  A bag might seem like a step backwards, but it doesn't have to be thrown away very often compared to emptying a canister, so it saves you time.  This is a reason for commercial use too, a business cannot empty a canister every time they vacuum a room, with the bag they are good to go for a long time.  The air expelled from the HEPA bag and the material zipper bag seems clean indeed, so there should not be any concerns in this regard.The rubber bumper around the vacuum should make you feel confident that it will not damage furniture as long as the slightest care is still used.Overall, The Bank Heavy Duty is a New York State made commercial vacuuming machine!  You have to respect such a solid machine.  It could potentially last a commercial user many years and likely decades, you can only imagine how long it might last if you chose to use it in a home.  Nevertheless, for the price, you can spend less on a consumer product and get better looks and cool features.  Still, if you are a commercial property, pick a machine suited for the job, The Bank Heavy Duty might be just what you need!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKHFOVQ4B1ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNJ6N9M#wasThisHelpful","R1RKHFOVQ4B1ID","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Epson's C11CC87201 Expression Home XP-410 Wireless Printer, Scanner, and Copier might not be the printer with the most options on the market, but it does have some neat features at a great price.Firstly, the footprint is fantastic.  I have a tight space below my desk, there is a shelf but relatively small.  Nevertheless, the XP-410 fits there beautifully.  It's slightly complicated by the fact the printer has an upright paper feeder.  This looks somewhat cluttered and requires some available height above the printer.  Nevertheless, it is still a great option with the footprint.Secondly, the print quality is acceptable.  There are quite a few options for affordable Epson cartridges on the market.  It's your standard printer with black ink and three colors.Wireless functionality is fine.  With my Mac, both wireless printing and scanning was quick and easy.  Setup was automatic.The scanning feels somewhat slow compared to more pricey competitors.  I couldn't believe how long one black and white document copy took.  Therefore, if you plan to use this for serious office work, you might look at a more robust machine.  However, for a student or personal home printer and scanner, it will suffice.  It's an extra printer for me, so I have no complaints.  Recommended for the small footprint and price, but you can spend a little more and get more features and performance should you need it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27YMA3BOIU3ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBAPEYE#wasThisHelpful","R27YMA3BOIU3ZI","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Braun's Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper is a neat item in that it aims to bring a handheld clipper with wireless convenience.  The item is comfortable and light to hold.  It's much smaller than a traditional plug in clipper as well.Performance?  In terms of trimming directly with the metal clipper, the performance seems solid.  It trims beautifully.However, should you add on the easily adjustable comb and attempt to actually cut hair, it's a more interesting situation.  The relative light weight and size of the clipper causes it to not quite grasp the hair.  Therefore, you end up making many more passes than you would with a traditional hard wired clipper.Overall, if you're mainly using this for direct trimming around tough to reach spaces, it's a neat product as it's wireless.  However, for more heavy duty hair cutting, you might look at a traditional product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275HWYINTWZUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI0N61K#wasThisHelpful","R275HWYINTWZUY","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scotch Printer Message Tape sounded like a superb idea to me.For those most fragile shipments, you could combine strong packaging tape and a message to remind anyone handling the package to be careful.  Well, the second part the tape accomplishes, the first part, not so much.The tape is simply not strong enough to use as your primary tape to seal those fragile boxes.  You will find you can easily lift up the flaps of the box with little effort, if this is the only tape you apply.  It simply is not strong enough.Nevertheless, the tape is quite expensive. Therefore, why would you want to use it as your primary tape?  My recommendation?  Simply secure your box or package with the tape you normally trust to seal it.  Then, should the package be particularly fragile, wrap a single strip of this across the top to alert handlers that it is fragile.  Solution and a cost saver!  Therefore, it's still a useful product.

"Ambient Weather's WR-334-U is a great emergency solar and hand crank weather radio, flashlight, siren, and smart phone charger.The product is unique as it is appealing to today's solar kick, but with the more reliable hand crank also available.  Truly, why be without a radio in an emergency?  You won't be with this option.  I love that.  Stash it where you know you can find it in your home, and you will be ready when you lose power or goodness forbid, an emergency/disaster.The radio functionality works great and a weather radio band is also included.  The product attempts to make you upgrade from an older model you might have because it also includes cell phone charging for some of the more popular models such as the iPhone dock connector (but not the newest lightning connector you will need to use your own adapter for those).Overall, it's hard to argue against such a product.  Best of all, for those hard to decide on gifts, why not choose such a product?  It's practical and could truly help your family or friends in an emergency. The only downside is that the item is so versatile you might just want to use it as a radio from time to time.  The downside?  The downside is the compact nature of the unit, great for true emergencies, makes the quality of the sound output not the very best, but it is still usable without question.  Recommended product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LQQ90YL3Y95Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A81ICCE#wasThisHelpful","R1LQQ90YL3Y95Q","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TP-LINK's affordable TL-SG1016D is a terrific device for a prosumer or more likely, professional work environment.

"Remington's AQ7A Rotary Shaver is hard to criticize.  It offers a quality shaving product at a price much lower than the higher end shaving offerings, but has often demanded features.First, the expected wet functionality is here.  It can be used wet, but as most reviews suggest, you will find limited use for this functionality.Second, unique to a rotary shaver in this price range is an included docking station.  It seems simple, but it does help you keep it charged up, when you have an easy dock to drop it into.  Why fumble with hooking up the cable's plug each time, when you can just drop it in the cradle?  I love that!  Furthermore, leave it in the cradle regularly should you with.  With the lithium technology, you do not have to worry about batteries being affected overtime as dramatically as shavers from a decade ago. Sure, the battery will not last forever but it will hold up longer.Third, the shaving performance is as expected for this price range and even some shavers nearly twice as much.  Nevertheless, as other reviewers suggest, these products always leave some to be desired if you're particularly fussy regarding your shave.Overall, this is a quality product from Remington.  They have brought forward many premium features such as wet use technology, lithium battery technology to not see decreased battery performance over time, a charging cradle, and solid performance.  All of this can be had at an attractive value.  Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H1TEORHASMVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB5YFEU#wasThisHelpful","R2H1TEORHASMVF","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to try Office 365 Home Premium as I have purchased both Mac and Windows versions of Microsoft's Office suites for nearly two decades.At first I thought it might be some kind of online version of Office, but it most certainly isn't.  You receive a pin code with the purchase that you register at Microsoft's website.  You are then able to install Home Premium Office on up to 5 computers.  The cool factor?  The cool factor is that those five machines can be split between PCs and Macs.  Therefore, if you have 2 PCs, they can have the latest version of Office for Windows, and your 3 Macs can have the latest version of Office for Mac.  The catch?  The software on all those machines will expire in 365 days, and you will then need to purchase another year.Truthfully, if you're a Mac only or PC only household without many computers, you might get more value out of the non-expiring version if the number of licenses included will suffice in your home.There are two reasons one might choose the 365 product: First, you have Macs & PCs, so you want the latest version of Office for both platforms in one purchase.  Second, you have five machines in your home and the non-expiring version does not include 5 licensees (the non-expiring versions of office normally include only 1 or 3 licenses in certain family editions).Otherwise, you will likely get more value from the non-expiring version of the software.  The choice is yours.  Always up to date on 5 machines across 2 platforms with an annual cost, or a one time cost with less versatility.  One solution is not the best for everyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MYNHAP6X9OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPTUW2#wasThisHelpful","R36MYNHAP6X9OH","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meguiar's new White Wax is a terrific product and don't let the name fool you, it can be used on any color, not just white.Why is it called white wax?  Simple, it helps address a problem most visible on white and lighter colored vehicles.  On light vehicles, you can see contaminants on/in the paint more easily.  That spec of brown/black that doesn't want to come up, overall dullness, etc.  These issues are extremely visible on white and light colored cars.White wax helps address it because it is a cleaner wax with a heavy dose of cleaning properties, to help remove those contaminants that ruin the look of the paint.  Furthermore, it has enough cleaning ability that it could potentially remove very light scratches as well!What makes it even more powerful is that it includes a terrific applicator.  One side is very soft, like you would use to apply any wax, but the other side is soft with just a bit more texture, this gives the product even more ""bite,"" to remove contaminants or light defects.  The applicator is great.  I have even used the applicator with a more aggressive product to remove scratches.Truly, I have used white wax on a silver and black vehicle.  Meguiar's also makes a new black wax.  The black wax can also be used on any color.  The black product is called Black Wax because on a black car the contaminants in paint are less visible, so it cuts back on the cleaning/cut, and instead adds more polishing oils.  On a black car, polishing oils always add depth to the paint that makes it oh so deep looking, and it can also hide minor imperfections.Overall, these new White Wax & Black Wax products are great and not for only the colors the name suggests.  If you want more cleaning in your All in One Wax, White Wax is a great choice and comes with that great aggressive on one side, applicator.  However, if you want more polishing oils in your all in one product to add depth to the paint and hide some minor imperfections, try black wax.  Some fanatics are applying white wax, followed by black wax.  I will say that the longevity of White Wax does not seem as long as some of Meguiar's sealant only products, such as NXT Wax.  However, at the same time, since White Wax does remove some contaminants, it helps prep a cleaner/smooth surface to apply the wax, which could help a heavily contaminated car stay protected slightly longer.White wax targets the main issue of lighter colored vehicles.  Nevertheless, it can be useful for any vehicle.  The longevity of the wax protection in the product could be longer, but waxing is so easy with this ""liquid paste,"" that you won't mind waxing more often.  The only downsides: the toothpaste tube packaging gets wrinkled up, the liquid paste psychologically encourages you to use more product than you need, and therefore you will use this product quicker than you would a traditional liquid wax or paste wax.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BP6VFFFBU69U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OBW23O#wasThisHelpful","R2BP6VFFFBU69U","A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JUBRIZMO0RJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These measuring cups are extremely handy, particularly if you're making something with many ingredients that need to be measured. Instead of having to have several regular measuring cups on hand, or repeatedly cleaning one between measuring different ingredients, you have four specific sizes immediately at hand. And if you do have to repeat a specific measurement with a different ingredient, these smaller cups are easier to rinse and dry than a full-size measuring cup.They also lend themselves to more exact measuring. No longer having to interpret when you've hit the measurement line in a full-size cup, you simply fill the appropriate size cup with your ingredient then scrape across the top with the flat back blade of a knife or other implement.

"I bought this book on the strength of the John Sanford brand; I'd never heard of the other guy (Ctein), and now I know why.I really enjoy a good space opera. Unfortunately, this ain't one. Oh, it starts off with some of the classic elements: a mysterious starship is spotted by chance decelerating in deep space, then coming to a stop somewhere in Saturn's rings. Governments on Earth decide to secretly develop and launch our own spaceships to go there and explore the alien phenomenon. A space race ensues between the USofA and China. The usual assortment of ""quirky"" characters assemble on America's space station to convert it for deep-space travel. Off they go...Where this book badly misfires is that good space opera has to actually have some excitement, suspense, a sense of menace. Instead, we have a repetitive, tedious, uninteresting recitation of endless mundane detail and minutiae. Tweaking the cooling system; cutting off the ends of the living modules; repetitive recitations of the function of the ship's acceleration. Who cares??? Move on!!!The players aren't characters, they're caricatures: cartoonish, shallow, two-dimensional, interchangeable. The studly playboy; the gorgeous newscaster; the nerdish female engineer; the stoic ship's captain; the cuddly intellectual. Like that. Not one player with a lick of originality.In all honesty, I've made it a bit past the halfway point of this book, and I'm just giving up. I just can't finish it. Too boring, by far.Maybe it finally picks up later, I don't know, and frankly don't even care anymore. This thing's as thick as a brick, and weighs as much.

"I like a big watch. My everyday timepiece is a Rolex GMT-Master, which is pretty substantial. Since it’s also an expensive watch, being worth several thousand dollars, there are times when I’m going places, or doing things, when I’d rather leave it at home rather than take the risk of marring, losing, or damaging it.Because of that, I’ve been kind of half-heartedly in the market for a much less expensive alternative to wear on those occasions, so when this Swiss Legend became available to me through Amazon’s Vine program, I snapped it up.First, to address the price issue, I think Amazon’s “List Price” of $550 is wildly optimistic. No matter where you look on the Net, this is a sub-$100 watch. Which actually suited me just fine for my purposes: an inexpensive watch that, if it got damaged, I wouldn’t spend a lot of time mourning.It’s a quartz movement with analog display, and seems reasonably accurate, seeming to lose about 1 – 3 seconds a day, suitably within acceptable parameters.But I have to say, this is one MASSIVE watch! I didn’t actually weigh it, but holding both watches in hand, I’d guess the Legend watch is a good 15% heavier than the Rolex, at least. The Legend’s face is 3/16” larger in diameter than the Rolex’s, not including the bezel. When you include the bezel, the difference increases to ”. The case of the Legend is easily 50% thicker than the Rolex. The actual case is even wider than the face, and coated with a rubber material. It’s marked as being “water resistant” to 330 feet. As I said, this is a bathyscaphe for your wrist. According to the owner’s manual, it’s suitable for use while scuba diving.I find it to be a very handsome watch, but one caveat: the dial is harder to read than indicated in the picture on the product page. The watch face is noticeably darker than pictured; the numerals are very hard to distinguish; and the ends of the watch’s hands are coated with some black material that matches the coloration of the numerals. So though it’s very attractive, it doesn’t easily lend itself to “at a glance” use.But overall, I’m very pleased with it. I think it’s an excellent value for its price; it seems very robust (to say the least!) and durable; and if something does actually happen to it, it’ll be easy to replace and move on from.A very solid 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X6Q83SJXNEHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01445IEPE#wasThisHelpful","R1X6Q83SJXNEHB","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways this book reminds me of the BBC TV series “The Fixer”. A highly-skilled and superbly trained government operative drops out of service and goes off the grid, dedicating his life and “certain skill set” to helping strangers in desperate need in life-or-death situations.Evan Smoak is Orphan X (as in the Roman numeral). Now living a solitary life in Los Angeles, he helps people who are referred to him by previous “clients”. He doesn’t charge them anything, other than with the responsibility to pass his contact number on ONCE to someone else as desperate as they are. He’s the Nowhere Man.But something’s gone badly wrong. His last client seems to have quickly – much too quickly – passed his contact info on to TWO people, a violation of the protocol, and to further complicate matters, his new “clients” seem to be in the crosshairs of their pursuers to a deadly extreme that Evan hasn’t encountered before.As he tries to assess the situation and adjust his strategy, the net just seems to keep closing tighter and tighter, with very deadly consequences.I think Hurwitz has come up with a real winner in this book, and a fascinating protagonist in Evan Smoak. Unique, interesting, fully-realized and three-dimensional. The story had excellent plotting and pacing, exciting and believable action sequences, and a full cast of secondary characters.The only nit I have to pick, and it’s a minor one, is that I didn’t really get any sense of LA as a setting. That’s even though I actually live in the ‘burbs of that city.But I really recommend this book, and look forward to Smoak’s next outing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJILZQIIDC1DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067847#wasThisHelpful","RJILZQIIDC1DA","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 6-year-old granddaughter just loves this set.As soon as we opened it and got it set up with three AA batteries (not included), she went right to work cranking out art work for her mom and dad, rightfully proud of her results. It's easy to set up and use, and allows your own munchkin to create really nice artwork that will make their eyes glow with pride.After trying to position the top sheet (upon which one draws the picture) into the corner slots designed to hold it in place, and then maneuver the pattern sheets (from which one traces) under it, we just gave up, as that wasn't really necessary. She simply held everything in place with her hand as she drew her picture with the other hand, making the whole operation easier and more successful.There's an entire set of colored pencils included, and my munchkin wanted me to mention to the makers that they should include brown as one of the colors (got that, Alex Toys?). But be prepared to buy more, because you'll probably go through them pretty quick if your own munchkin, like mine, wants to color in all the background, too.There was more than enough like to shine through to the top, making tracing very easy.A solid 5 stars.

"How to describe a scent or aroma?When I first applied this cologne I was put off by a dominant scent of lemon. I'm not into citrus aromas. But after a few minutes, undoubtedly once the cologne had started reacting to my skin, that dominant note went away, and left a very refreshing and clean scent, with sweet and spicy tones such as vanilla with a bit of cedar.I really like this, as I'm not into ""girly"" scents for men. This is more masculine, though not too overtly woodsy. The scent seems to last longer than the ones I've currently been using, too. You don't have a flash of overpowering smell that quickly vanishes away to nothing, as has been the case with some I've used.I like this... a lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMD2JACGUPXDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CDEKK8#wasThisHelpful","RMD2JACGUPXDV","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw the new Mitch Rapp book “The Survivor” in the bookstore, I have to admit I bought it with mixed feelings. The sorely-missed Vince Flynn wrote top-notch political thrillers in this series, and I’ve been a fan from the start. So I was eager for the series to continue, but my experience with books written by substitute authors hasn’t been very good.This book continues with the elements that made the series unique: a blend of politics, espionage, and action.And credit due where earned, author Kyle Mills does a creditable job of trying to continue Flynn’s work.But I guess when an author conceives of – and then essentially lives with – a subject as the author of a continuing series over a period of years, there are just certain unique perspectives he brings to the work that no one else can.In this case, most noticeably to me, there were certain nuances, particularly in the characters and most particularly in Rapp himself, that just didn’t ring QUITE right to me. Rapp seems to me to be more thuggish than he has throughout the series to now; less subtle in his thoughts and actions; less strategic in his approach to issues. I felt some of the same issues pertain to Irene Kennedy, too. The characters just didn’t resonate quite right with me.Overall still an enjoyable book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9SME992S6IEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476783454#wasThisHelpful","R9SME992S6IEY","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She had a lot of fun personalizing her boat with the included decals.

"This is essentially heavy-handed political propaganda masked as a kid's movie. Worse yet, as a movie it's not very well done.There's a whole lot of sound and fury wrapped up in a poorly plotted story. The visual effects are well-done, but that's the movie's biggest accomplishment, and if that's all you're looking for you can get better at the theme park rides. The level of violence makes me question what audience this film's targeted at. It's far too violent for young children, and from the amount of political preechifying it seems to me it's supposed to be a movie for grownups.

"I won’t write a story synopsis as you can get that from the book’s Amazon product page, which I would assume is how you got to the reviews in the first place.In this outing, we get to revisit Elvis Cole and Joe Pike doing what they do best: solving crime. This time out they’re joined by LAPD officer Scott James and his K-9 sidekick Maggie, previously seen as the protagonists in Crais’s novel “Suspect”.Briefly, a chemical engineer who specializes in explosives, Amy Breslyn, has disappeared from her job and fallen off the grid after her son was killed overseas in a terrorist suicide bombing attack. It’s been reported that Amy’s now trying to sell several hundred pounds of high explosives to the terrorist underground. Amy’s supervisor hires Elvis to find her and bring her back into the fold. Naturally, things aren’t as simple as they seem, and from that premise all things flow.Crais does his usual credible and entertaining job in presenting the story. Elvis seems to be maturing with age – he’s not as flippant as in the earlier works – and this works well. If you do the math, Elvis is a Vietnam vet, which makes him a guy who’s easily in his late 50s by now, if not older. In fact, that’s actually one of my prime nits to pick with this (and some of the earlier books of the series) story. Elvis and Joe Pike seem to have been bitten by the Peter Pan bug. Don’t these guys EVER age?But the book still works if you put that aside. Very good pacing and plot presentation; the story moves right along, and is easy to follow. There are some pretty good surprises that are entertainingly revealed. The main characters are three-dimensional, and we have some pretty good action sequences.Blending Scott James and Maggie in with Elvis and Pike also worked for the book.A solid 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LBECX17IOHAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916149X#wasThisHelpful","R1LBECX17IOHAA","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Newcomer Nicholas Petrie has entered the thriller field with a new protagonist named Peter Ash.Ash is a former Marine, now a civilian, suffering from PTSD brought on by his tours in the Sandbox (Iraq and Afghanistan) which expresses itself as pretty extreme claustrophobia. Due to his condition, Ash lives pretty much off the grid, either in his truck or in the open wilds.When he learns that one of his former sergeants has committed suicide, Ash decides to help out his widow and kids by doing some repairs on their house. While doing so, he finds a suitcase filled with money and some plastic explosive, guarded by a monster dog. This discovery puts him on the trail of a conspiracy that will ultimately endanger not only his own life, but those of the people he set out to help in the first place.Overall, I thought the book was entertaining, though I do think there are some aspects that are a bit problematic.To begin, I think Petrie has a lot of talent, and shows promise. But I found the exposition of the plot to be uneven, and sometimes choppy and hard to follow. The action sequences were well done. The presentation of the main characters was pretty well done, and most of them were pretty three-dimensional, a common failing with many first-time authors that Petrie avoided.As this is a “thriller debut” (according to Amazon’s product description), I’m assuming Ash will be starring in his own series. I’m also assuming that when an author is creating a new series protagonist, at least part of the goal is to make that character unique and memorable. In that respect, Petrie has made Ash a claustrophobic, which will put him in the position of living off the grid and moving around a lot, maybe along the lines of Lee Childs’s Jack Reacher character.But I think that’s a curious choice that presents a problem, and one of the things I actually found somewhat annoying about this book. Every time Ash goes into a building or other enclosed environment, we’re subjected to this repeated exposition about his symptoms flaring up, to the point that it becomes a distraction, and Ash starts coming across as kind of whiny. It also seems to happen somewhat selectively in its severity, in that the character has to rapidly egress some settings due to the problem, but can function just fine at other times when the advancement of the plot requires it. This is a troubling inconsistency.Further, I think this could well present a serious problem, and limitation, of what Petrie is going to be able to have Ash doing if and as this series progresses. It’s one thing for Childs’s Reacher character to stay off the grid out of choice, as he can still – and does – operate in normal environments constantly. But that’s not the case with Petrie’s Ash character.Anyway, as I said, it’s an entertaining debut. I’ll be interested in reading the next entry in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CG43J0LALFAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174567#wasThisHelpful","R1CG43J0LALFAD","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last several years the Reacher canon has been in a downward spiral and this latest entry in the series is plumbing new and disgusting lows, not only in the antagonists, but in protagonist Jack Reacher, too. After reading it, I felt completely disgusted, and felt as if I needed a scalding hot shower to wash off the filth.When the series started, Reacher was the knight in slightly tarnished armor who found himself helping out some poor soul who’d found themselves embroiled in some kind of sticky situation they couldn’t handle themselves, and Reacher would step in, like the Lone Ranger, and save the day.But as time has gone on, and particularly of late, author Child seems to have tired of the formula that made his success, and instead has created these utterly unbelievable situations that border on the surreal, if not outright insane, and the result has been to turn a formerly entertaining and enjoyable series into something beyond dark, almost absurdly gothic.In this case, a very small town in the middle of nowhere – literally, a place surrounded by flat wheat fields to the visible horizon, so far out that it’s hours to the nearest area with cell phone service – named Mother’s Rest is the locus of events, starting with the disappearance and murder of a former FBI agent cum private investigator.Reacher gets off the daily train out of curiosity about the town’s name and meets Michelle Chang, a colleague of the missing PI who’s trying to locate him. Without revealing details that would contain spoilers, I can say that their investigation leads them to a deadly conspiracy based in the Dark Web – that underbelly of the internet that most of us never even access – that’s located in Mother’s Rest, leading to a final and very deadly confrontation.As I mentioned earlier, my biggest problem with the book was the nature of the secret upon which the conspiracy is centered. Quite frankly, it was beyond disgusting and disturbing. It was depraved. This was more Stephen King territory than Jack Reacher.But also problematic is that author Child has once again created an utterly unbelievable locale in which to base the story, in order to create a situation in which Reacher can operate.Mother’s Rest is so far out in the sticks that it seems to be enclosed in an impenetrable bubble from the outside world, like in the TV series “The Dome”. How is it that no cops of any type ever come by? How is it that a whole bunch of townspeople are involved in this conspiracy, but in a town this small no OTHER townsfolk seem to be aware of it, and called the authorities for an investigation? Why is it that Reacher and Chang themselves don’t just call the authorities – county, state or federal – once they learn the exact nature of the crimes?Not only do you have to suspend your disbelief to buy into this story, but you have to shut down all common sense, too.Further, the character of Reacher himself has changed dramatically from the early days of the series. Gone is the creaky knight, the literary Lone Ranger. This Reacher no longer seems to have any interest in anything much other than blowing the bad guys away. And somehow he manages to do that without ever having to answer or explain anything to anyone anywhere in a position of authority. More of that vacuum I mentioned earlier.Based on this book, and coupled with my experience with the last few, I have to say that from this point on I’ll be waiting to buy any of these Reacher books until I find out more about them. I can’t recommend this one at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKOYW0SVHURJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178771#wasThisHelpful","RKOYW0SVHURJZ","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When we opened the box, my almost-6-year-old munchkin's eyes lit right up.

"I've been a fan of this series from the first book, and in this entry authors Coughlin and Davis take protagonist Kyle Swanson into new territory.The book opens in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1992, when Swanson was a young three-striper Marine sergeant still in the early stages of his career. While ""the Mog"" is in meltdown mode, with local warlords grappling for supremacy, the Marines are trying to keep the peace.Swanson and his crew find themselves caught up in the struggle, and while trying to meet their mission parameters Swanson manages to alienate a psycho enforcer for one of the warlords -- the Cobra, a maniac who seeks his own vengeance by destroying everything Swanson holds dear in the region.Flash forward a couple of decades, to the present, and Swanson is mandatorily ""retired"" from the Corps, but his skills are still deemed useful to the government, so he's seconded to the CIA. At the same time, the Cobra, finally on the loose again after the events of 1992, has come to the US to seek his own vengeance in yet another terrorist attack, this time targeting one of the biggest malls in the country.This leads to a final confrontation between Swanson and the Cobra, as both do their best to destroy the other.I really liked this book. The pacing and excitement are on a par with the rest of the series, but we also get a look into Swanson's past as the Somalia events unfold. This really gives us valuable insight into important events that molded Swanson into what he ultimately became. I think it's also important to note that the authors allow Swanson to change and develop over time as this series has progressed, avoiding the error that so many series authors make by seemingly freezing their characters in time like some kind of Peter Pan, never aging and with their circumstances seemingly embedded in amber.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQ8ZWX8AHBEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057825#wasThisHelpful","R3VQ8ZWX8AHBEE","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In all honesty, I finally gave up after about 120 pages.I didn't like any of the central characters, finding them unsympathetic, and therefore didn't care at all what happened to them. For a book to succeed for me, I have to be able to emotionally invest with at least one of the protagonists, otherwise forget it.Then there's the fact that a homosexual love story is a central element, with very graphic depictions.

"In ""The Governor's Wife"" Michael Harvey returns to the style and scope of hard-boiled detective fiction that put him on the map, leaving behind the unbelievable nonsense he had his Michael Kelly character doing in the last couple of books.This time around Kelly's been hired by an unknown client to track down a disgraced and convicted former governor who disappeared from custody immediately following his conviction at trial and sentencing to 30 years in prison.As Kelly probes the case it slowly becomes clear that there are a lot more things in play than simply someone trying to escape a prison sentence, and that other players have their own agendas, which they seem willing to forward even if there's a price to be paid in blood.Harvey's portrayal of Illinois and Chicago corruption is appropriately dark and cynical, and PI Kelly is the proper knight in tarnished armor to wade through it as he seeks to clear the case and find out exactly what's going on.This is a concise, fast-paced story with several fun plot twists. Is it ""great literature""? No. But it doesn't pretend to be. It's a fun read, great for the beach or poolside, or on the flight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1900HTXCVNDNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307958647#wasThisHelpful","R1900HTXCVNDNU","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Power of the Dog"" was the first Winslow book I read, and liked it so much I was motivated to read the rest of his body of work, which includes ""Savages"" and ""The Dawn patrol"", among others. I don't know why, but he seems to be one of the overlooked gems in the literary world.In ""Cartel"", he picks up the story of the vendetta between US drug agent Art Keller and Mexican drug lord Adan Barrera.Years after the events described in ""Dog"" Keller comes out of retirement when Barrera escapes from the prison Keller's arrest confined him to, and picks up trying to recapture his dream of consolidating control over the massive drug activities in Mexico by establishing himself as the sole emperor of the drug realm.This is a huge, complex story because, just as in ""Dog"", Winslow's research seems to have been impeccable. The drug wars in Mexico, as has been extensively detailed in actual news coverage, are incredibly complex, with many factions vying for control, constantly killing each other as the power shifts from faction to faction, all accompanied by unbelievable ""collateral damage"" in civilian deaths and government corruption.Essentially, Mexico is a failed nation-state, and Winslow's book gives us a pretty clear idea of why that is.This isn't necessarily an ""easy read"", as there are so many ""players"" involved -- just as there are in real life -- and in many ways it reminds me of ""The Godfather"" (the Puzo book, not the movies) as it paints the picture of the plays and counterplays, betrayals and alliances; you have to pay attention or you'll lose track of the players.But I think it's a pretty accurate reflection of real life (as was ""Dog""), and was very well done. A very rewarding read.I thought the plotting and pacing were excellent, and the portrayals of the main characters were vivid and three-dimensional. There are definitely gut-punches emotionally, as well as payoffs.I recommend this book without reservation, and if you read ""Dog"", it's a must-read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32VYCLL9NELYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874996#wasThisHelpful","R32VYCLL9NELYA","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tuned into this show for a ""binge-watch"" while it was running on the NBC website. It was plugged as being a ""mini-series"", and as such I expected it to follow a conventional story arc with a beginning, middle, and end. Which leads me to my first BIG problem with the show: it doesn't actually end.Contrary to the ads (or at least my understanding of them), this is actually only ""Season 1"", meaning the story lines DON'T end. In fact, the end of the last episode concludes with several plot line ""cliffhangers"". Frankly, this really ticked me off.Having lived through the era, I can say that there's a lot they got right... BUT there's also quite a bit they got laughingly wrong, starting with the slang people use in the dialogue. Anachronisms abound, with people using words and phrases that hadn't yet come into the parlance.I question the use of a historical figure like Charley Manson. I understand the dramatic theme they wanted to explore with the character, but I think the story would have been better served by using a fictional character to represent his element rather than a monster who really existed in real life. By using the real Manson as the antagonist, a lot of the potential dramatic possibilities are simply removed from the equation. We KNOW that no matter what Manson does, Duchovny's cop character isn't going to arrest or kill him.I also found that other than Duchovny's cop character, I didn't find most of the other characters very appealing or sympathetic. Thus, if or when bad things happened to them, I didn't really care all that much.But again, my biggest peeve is that the story didn't actually end. Though I found it fairly entertaining, it wasn't entertaining enough that I'm at all interested in tuning back in for another season of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAYL11H74L5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGO1U6Y#wasThisHelpful","RXAYL11H74L5A","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm half Armenian, and our cultural cuisine often uses olive oil as an ingredient. Further, I grew up in a military family, and spent my teen years in Iran, and again, olive oil is essential to Middle Eastern cuisine. Though not an oil ""expert"", I do know what I like.My go-to oil is Pompeian Extra Virgin First Cold Press.Always being open to trying new things, I jumped at the chance to test-drive these new (to me) offerings. Frankly, I was very disappointed.Both had a bitter taste I didn't care for, especially compared to the Pompeian. I don't like the flavor of the oil to overpower the inherent flavor of the main ingredients of a dish. They're supposed to complement, not subdue.The bitter taste was stronger in the Arbequina, in addition to which it hit the back of my tongue with a strong peppery taste. If I want to pepper my food, I know where the shaker is.The Cornicabra wasn't as overpowering, but again there was a bitter note I just didn't care for.So for now, I think I'll be sticking with the Pompeian until something better comes down the pike.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HC1Q6LERUJT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJP09WM#wasThisHelpful","R1HC1Q6LERUJT0","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I wrote in my review of the prequel to this book (The Counterfeit Agent), there isn't enough actual ""story"" here to sustain two full books. I gave that book a 3  star rating, but this book doesn't even rate that highly.I won't recap the story line here. You can get that on the book's Amazon Product Description page.If you haven't read ""The Counterfeit Agent"", rest assured that Berenson spends somewhere around 80 pages or so bringing you up to speed. If you HAVE read that book, prepare yourself for a bore fest as you wade through stuff you already know.The problems continue. Because Berenson's trying to drag out a story long enough to justify a book of its own, the pacing is just simply snail-slow. Wells and his buddies, Dutro and Schaeffer, meander from place to place. Nothing much happens for pages and pages at a time, other than pretty pedestrian descriptions of locale, or characters navel-gazing.Berenson's early works were notable for their complex plots and engaging action, along with three-dimensional characterizations, usually coupled with a topic that seemed ripped from the headlines about current events. Though the plot revolves around Iran's potential nuclear WMD capability, it's lacking the other aspects of those early works. I have to wonder if Berenson's simply lost his mojo.In all honesty, many times I'd find my mind just wandering away while trying to read this story, and by the time I came to the end, I just didn't care much at all anymore.Buyer beware... really.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OH9PXWZADBEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159746#wasThisHelpful","R3OH9PXWZADBEP","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Making it an excellent value.Let's face it. You're not buying a Galaxy or iPhone here. This is a no-name low priced UNLOCKED cell phone with a lot of bells and whistles. And because it is a no-name phone, you're also not paying $500 or $600 or more for it.First and foremost, it's unlocked, meaning you can use it on any of the major networks' 4G systems. And because it's not system-dedicated, it doesn't come pre-loaded with a bunch of network garbage software. It comes with the Android OS and a couple of basic systems to go online and operate the cameras, and that's it. You then can go to the Android App Store and download only that software you actually want to have on your phone.The cameras are fine, especially the main camera, which is 13 MP. Screen resolution is quite nice. The back is detachable, so you can access the interior compartment to change the battery - especially useful if you have a spare on hand - as well as add a sim card to expand the onboard memory to 32 GB.The phone comes with some of the accessories that you typically have to pay extra for: a protective case, screen protector, and stereo headset.Its Achilles Heel, I think, is that the removable back of the case is made of thin plastic that I can foresee easily cracking or breaking. It hasn't happened to me yet, but it sure seems flimsy to me.The OS is Android Kit-Kat 4.4.I am quite impressed.

"And that's not meant to be a good thing.I'm not going to do a story recitation here. You can get that from the book's Product Page.Unlike ""Jurassic Park"", there's no effort made whatsoever to actually establish any suspense, background, a plot, or three-dimensionality to the characters. A bunch of people are dropped into a setting -- in this case a theme park in China at which the main attraction is a bunch of actual living dragons -- and in literally just a few pages the dragons go on a rampage and everyone's running for their lives, fighting dragons, dangling from cliffs, fighting monster crocodiles, etcetera etcetera ad nauseum.If we're going to compare this book to ""Jurassic Park"" -- as the publishers do on the book jacket, as well as many of the other reviewers -- then let's actually do it.What made ""Jurassic Park"" such an entertaining book (and movie) was the mounting sense of doom and dread, culminating in a life-or-death confrontation with the dinosaurs. Chrichton took his time in establishing the sense of wonder at the science and setting, and firmly established his characters so we felt we knew (and sympathized with) them.There's absolutely none of that in this book. It's like a cartoon. As I said, we have a bunch of two-dimensional characters dropped into a locale like lumps of coal in a bin, and immediately they're off fighting dragons. It's as if Chrichton were to start ""Jurassic Park"" at a point thee-quarters of the way through, and try to stretch what little story remains into a full-length book.To sum it up in one word:  boring.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K6E6PQM29Z3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476749558#wasThisHelpful","R1K6E6PQM29Z3L","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Depp's first two Spandau entries were sharp, edgy, somewhat satirical mysteries rooted in the Movieland sub-culture, affording us an insider's peek at the slime under the façade that is mythical ""Hollywood"".Unfortunately, I didn't think this book lived up to that same standard.I found the story line to be muddled; characters' actions were all over the map, with consistent inconsistencies. Spandau seemed somehow ""diluted"", less grounded than in the earlier books, less forceful. Easier to distract and push around. Less decisive.

"These outdoor path lights do exactly what they claim: they sense motion, then cast light down onto (presumably) your pathway.One has plenty of options in the marketplace, the most common being ornamental path lights, typically powered by solar cells. Those have their advantages: they're generally aesthetically pleasing, and low maintenance (as they're solar-powered). However, the drawback is that they typically don't generate much light; more ornamental than functional.These units take a polar opposite approach to the issue. They're far more functional than ornamental. In fact, they have a somewhat ""industrial"" appearance. Depending on your design taste, you may not really want them somewhere prominent on your lot. There's not really much the designers could do about that, I suppose, as the body of the unit has to be big enough to hold the batteries.Which raises another issue: they are battery powered, meaning you have to, at least occasionally, actually change batteries. That's a labor and cost issue, when comparing to solar units, the trade-off being brighter light from these units. I don't yet know how long a set of batteries lasts, but they are powering the light AND the motion sensor. I guess we'll see.I've put them near a brick deck that's in a dark and recessed part of my lot, and they work very well. On a personal note, they aren't something I'd particularly want to place on the front walkway of my yard leading to my front door, but that's a matter of my own taste, and your aesthetic sense may well be very different from mine.Overall, 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V99PI213RE1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJOIWW6#wasThisHelpful","R3V99PI213RE1Z","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book isn't a ""thriller"". It's a legal mystery novel, or ""whodunit"". ""Thriller"" is a term rightfully applied to a story with a lot of action, bullets flying everywhere and car chases up the yin-yang. A hero dodging evil villains, in imminent danger of being violently killed. This book ain't that.What it IS is a well-crafted mystery novel based in the legal arena about a man wrongly accused of murder, and his efforts to clear his name and keep from being sent to prison.Mitzner's clearly in his element in this melieu. He knows his lawyering; his characters are fully three-dimensional; the plot is satisfyingly complex; and the climax and Big Reveal was a complete surprise to me, as I was absolutely sure I'd figured out ""whodunit""... and was completely wrong.Very entertaining; a solid 4 stars.________________________________________________________________A side note to the publishing industry: not every book that isn't a romance or scifi is a ""thriller"", and your constant abuse of that term is annoyingly brain-dead.

Instead, it's primarily a bunch of non-fiction stories about some snipers' experiences in the Sandbox during the War on Terror.

"Cell phones and tablets keep getting bigger; laptops and notebooks keep getting smaller; the dividing lines between the various device types keep betting murkier.This is a great thing for consumers because it means more options.This Dell laptop/notebook is a great example. It's small for a laptop, but the screen size is too big to be a traditional tablet. Yet the keyboard swivels around to the bottom of the unit turning it into a large tablet.Setup was easy. Turn it on, set up your logon info, connect to the internet, either wirelessly or by cable, let Windows Update do its thing, and you're done.Screen resolution is good, but not great. One problem, and I don't know whether it's an issue with this type of computer or just a problem with my individual unit, but the little light that typically illuminates when the hard drive's running doesn't do anything other than briefly light up when the unit starts up. At one point during the update process the screen had been dark for a long time and that light wasn't on. I didn't know whether or not the unit had frozen up until I put my ear next to it and could hear the hard drive working away. There is an HD icon next to the light, so it is what I think it is; it just doesn't seem to work.There's no optical drive, so if you need to access DVDs for any reason - software, data storage, disc burning, whatever - you'll need to buy an external drive to connect up.One caveat, for which I'm not deducting any stars: this unit is comes with the Win 8.1 operating system (OS) installed. I HATE Win 8.1, and the minute the next OS comes out in a few months (Win 10, reportedly) I'm upgrading to it. Naturally, this isn't a Dell issue; they manufacture hardware using the latest and ""greatest"" from Windows. But Win 8.1 has been an unmitigated disaster as an OS - rightfully so, in my opinion - so if you're in the market and can wait for the new OS to come out, you may want to consider that option.Overall, a very nice laptop/notebook/tablet/whatever, with the limitations inherent to the type.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X1SYL6ST0PN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJNEDSU#wasThisHelpful","R2X1SYL6ST0PN3","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a pretty good cook, and I always enjoy eating my home-cooked meals. Unfortunately, I DON'T enjoy the actual preparation of it; the grunt work of cooking. So I'm always on the lookout for anything that'll make that chore easier.When I was given the opportunity to get this grill through the Amazon Vine program, I jumped on it.Unless you live in a cave, you're probably familiar with the George Foreman Grills, even if you've never seen the ubiquitous infomercials. I was. But somehow or another, even though that awareness was rattling around somewhere in the back of my mind I never actually got one. So when it arrived the other day, I had to try it out immediately.Set-up couldn't be easier: unpack the box, and you're ready to go. Plug it in; it pre-heats; then the green light tells you it's ready. Throw your food on, cook, eat.I tried it out with a 10 ounce filet mignon. As advertised, the steak cooked to the desired doneness based on the time I left it in the grill, in my case 8 minutes for ""well done"" with a touch of pink inside. Almost no smoke while cooking; very little fat run-off as filet mignon is a very lean cut of meat; the outside was nicely browned (charred, caramelized, whatever term you want to use); it tasted fine.This is extremely convenient, the main benefit I think these grills address. My usual prep for a steak like this is my outdoor grill, which entails preheating the grill, then putting on the steak and cooking it for about 8 minutes per side, all the time having to schlep outside for every step of the process. This is far more convenient, as the grill is right on my kitchen counter, and BOTH sides of the meat are cooking at the same time, cutting total cooking time in half.One big caveat:  the pictures, and the advertising copy, indicate that you can cook a lot of stuff on this grill at the same time, and I'd take that with a HUGE grain of salt. The ad copy says: ""With 80 square Inch of cooking space, the personal grill can cook four servings of fresh or frozen grilled favorites at a time."" (All the spelling and grammatical errors are theirs, BTW).Well.... Hmmmm.....Probably true, IF you're using small portions. The picture on the product page of those four salmon steaks (I think that's what they are).... Well, those must be pretty small steaks. I measured the cooking area inside the raised boundaries, and it's actually about 10"" X 7"", for a true effective area of a bit over 70 sq. in., and my 10 oz. steak took up a lot of that area. I probably could have fit a bit more stuff onto that grill, but it would have been a tight fit, and I'm not really interested in trying to do jigsaw puzzle food placement on a hot griddle.You might be able to get 4 burgers on it, if they're small. More realistically, think 2 or 3 good sized burgers at a time.Bottom line: you're not going to be using a single one of these to feed yourself and several friends you have over. Which is why I got two!Clean-up is incredibly easy. As advertised, due to its non-stick surface all you have to do is wipe away any residue with a paper towel. If the plates require washing, they're dishwasher-safe, and easily snap out of the unit.Overall, I'm very pleased, and think this will be a welcome addition to my kitchen arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9OW5JD0PJHKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXP2#wasThisHelpful","R9OW5JD0PJHKN","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't like this book nearly as much as the others in the series.Department Q, headed up by Inspector Carl Morck, handles cold cases in Denmark. But this book departs from the usual format in that they're investigating the ""disappearance"" of a victim that we readers know has been murdered, but Morck and his crew don't. In fact, the case is very much a current case (unbeknownst to the Dept. Q folks), as the killers, as well as a witness (the titular ""Marco""), are all still running around pursuing their individual agendas.Much less time is spent on Morck and Company in this book than in the others, to the detriment of the story. A lot of time is spent on Marco and his pursuers. Frankly, this leads to a very disjointed feel in the storytelling, a somewhat Keystone Kops atmosphere, and I didn't care for ANY of these characters, in all honesty, so I just didn't really care what happened to any of them.

I have no idea how you're supposed to compose your shots this way. ""Blind"" luck, quite literally. Even when people use equipment with aiming capability they shoot a lot of just plain bad pics and video. How can this POSSIBLY be better?The ""work around"" seems to be that if you have an iPhone, you can link this camera to the phone (Android users such as me are just out of luck on this) and use the phone as your aiming device...... but if you have an iPhone on hand, why do you need this camera at all? The iPhone has a viewer, so you can compose your shots, as well as zoom capability, making this Bemo utterly superfluous.At its price point of over a hundred bucks, there are plenty of pocket cams available that shoot not only video but still pics, as well as having zoom capabilities and viewfinders of some kind.I can't for the life of me figure out what market niche Logitech's chasing with this little Bemo, unless it's people who want to shoot a bunch of ""selfie movies"", and for some reason don't want to - or can't - use their cell phones or pocket cameras.That seems to me to be a pretty limited market.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LOCKMLCWIVJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP1KMKG#wasThisHelpful","R1LOCKMLCWIVJD","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years now we've all been at the mercy of the crusade against incandescent light bulbs (ILB). Frankly, I am, and always have been, a fan of ILBs. They come in a range of wattages; they come in a range of types of light they emit (warm, cool, soft, etc.); and they're cheap.For quite a while, the only viable alternative was compact fluorescent lights (CFL), which had a lot of drawbacks, in my opinion. They were expensive. They were fluorescent, meaning they didn't come on instantly, and there was a flicker to them. I do not like the ""quality"" of the light they emit.Now we have the latest entry to come down the pike: light emitting diodes (LED). When given the opportunity, through the Vine program, to try this out I jumped at it.Again, in comparison to ILB, these LEDs are expensive. Frankly, I'm not sure when the financial break-even point would come in switching from ILB to either of the alternatives, given the unit price of ILBs in comparison to both CFLs and LEDs. I suspect it will be years down the road, if ever.That having been said, the first impression I had was solidity. This bulb is very heavy and solid. The term ""robust"" comes to mind. It fit handily into my desktop lamp in my home office, replacing a GE 95 watt ""Soft White"" ILB.It came on instantly when the switch was thrown, just like an ILB. Good!I was surprised by just how ""white"" the light from the LED is, especially when compared to an ILB that is itself ""Soft White"". It's VERY ""white"". Almost a ""sterile"" feel to it. Light ""quality"" is a very subjective judgment, and I'm not sure I like this yet. I'll have to give it some time, and I may come back and add to this review at a later date; an addendum.Due to the bottom half of the unit being made of a finned plastic housing - probably for heat dissipation - the actual ""bulb"" or lens itself only exists from its equator up. So the light is, to some extent, projected upwards and laterally, as opposed to the radiant dispersal pattern of an ILB. However, it does light the entire office adequately.When I look at things illuminated with this light, I'm seeing colors rendered truly and accurately. As a photography buff, this is very important to me, as I view my prints in my home office under the lamp illumination. I have to say that I've never seen such accurate color rendition under room illumination before. That's a big plus.I think this LED would be less than ideal in the living areas of the house; the living room, dining room; family room. It's too ""cold"". But I can see a ""warmer"" version being very suitable.All in all, I'm impressed. I consider this a successful proof of the LED concept in home lighting, with the possible proviso of the price.ADDENDUM.... Okay, some math.I decided to work out the numbers. This bulb is supposed to last 25,000 hours according to the warranty. It costs $24. Therefore you get 1,042 hours per dollar spent.A standard 95 watt ILB costs a buck, and gives you a 1,400 hour life. Advantage is CLEARLY to the ILB, on that basis, by about a 40% margin.To produce the same ""amount"" of light, the ILB uses 95 watts versus the LED's 19 watts. Over that same 25,000 hour period, the ILB will use 2,375,000 watts versus the LED's 475,000. Advantage LED, by about a 500% margin.I currently pay 10 cents/KwH. That means that over that period, the ILB will use $237.50 of power versus the LED's $47.50. A saving of $195 over 25,000 hours of usage (supposedly about 23 years, based on Kobi's assumption of 3 hours of usage daily). That saves you about $8.48/year.So it looks to me like the break-even point will be a little under three years down the road.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FB6Q2FL81GFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKUDHA2#wasThisHelpful","R3FB6Q2FL81GFH","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is your own personal ""cloud"", and I really like the idea and practicality of having this much actual storage available without actually having to use the REAL ""cloud"". I don't like having my personal data floating somewhere in the ether, accessible to who knows who.It's a full 8 terrabytes of storage, which can be used in a 4 X 2 terrabyte configuration, too, essentially a dual backup system.It uses USB 3.0, which in my case is driven by the backward-compatibility USB 2.0. Setup was fast, simple, and intuitive. Transfer rate is very fast (it must really sing in full USB 3.0 format).I'm using a Dell system, Win 7 64-bit. No problems at all.I'm an avid still photographer and videographer, and I can't even imagine shooting so much stuff that I'll run out of storage space on this unit. It's simply MASSIVE.Now bear in mind, that's what I use it for: storage and backup. I'm NOT using it as a primary drive, though one could easily do so, I suppose. I have no idea what the slower transfer speed of USB 2.0 would do to its accessibility. I suspect it would be pretty slow as far as being used as a ""primary"" drive. I still use my Dell's internal drive as the primary, and use this as my storage/backup of finished product.I'm very pleased, and I may add to this review in the future if and as I discover more capabilities, and gain more experience with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ0KSJESJ6U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU686D2#wasThisHelpful","RRJ0KSJESJ6U4","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book's a welcome return to the style and elements of the classic Jack Reacher books, and far superior to the very disappointing offerings of the last few years.Reacher has been recruited by one of his old Army bosses to hunt down a former top-tier military sniper - a guy Reacher had arrested while still an MP - who is one of several such men suspected of targeting an upcoming G8 summit meeting in London. The search takes him to Europe, affording us the opportunity to see Reacher in a new environment, and pits him and his temporary associates against a challenging set of dangerous foes.The story line and pacing are crisp; the settings are well described; the ancillary characters are all fully fleshed and three-dimensional. This is definitely a return to the Reacher of yore. Author Child seems to have blown out the cobwebs and ennui, which had become so evident in recent years with the rote offerings we'd seen lately.One nit I do have to pick, which is especially germane in stories in this genre: Lee Child, if you're reading this review, PLEASE get some help from someone knowledgeable about guns and ballistics if you're going to include a lot of gun stuff in your next book. The gaffes in this one were truly cringe-worthy to any gun guy.Yes, the .44 Remington Magnum is a larger diameter caliber than the .223 Remington, the 7.62 NATO, the .308 Winchester (which is actually the civilian version of the 7.62 NATO), and the British .303, BUT............. the .44 Mag is a HANDGUN cartridge, and has nowhere near the destructive power of any of those RIFLE calibers. Even the relatively puny .223 Remington (the standard service round of the M-16 rifle in its 5.56 NATO configuration) has more muzzle energy (read ""destructive power"") than the .44 Mag, at about 1700 ft/lbs of energy versus 1500 ft/lbs in the .44's most powerful loading.The other major problem was that several times in the story a key element was the time it takes a bullet from a .50 BMG round - the ""sniper"" round from a Barrett rifle - to travel 1400 yards. Child wrote that it takes three seconds. In fact, the velocity of that round is approximately 3,000 feet per second, meaning the travel time is actually 1.4 seconds. Until you read the book, you won't understand how important that error really is. But take it from me; it is important.That having been said, a welcome addition to the Reacher saga.

"I'm not going to write a plot summary here, as this is a review and not a school book report. I assume that if you've made it this far you've already read the Amazon Product Page and have some idea of what the book's about.My experience with Barclay's books over the years has been mixed. I thought a couple were really good, and some were pretty bad. I'm afraid this one falls more into the latter category.It's a sequel to a previous book, ""No Time For Goodbye"", picking up the central characters from that book a few years down the road. So, the first problem; a lot of time is spent re-establishing the characters, and what changes have taken place in their lives. It's pretty slow going.Barclay sometimes has a habit of pausing the action - repeatedly - for the characters to indulge in a lot of contemplative navel-gazing.  This can be effective in fleshing out a character, but when done to excess it becomes boring, repetitive, and annoying. This book is a classic example of doing it to excess. I found myself skimming and even skipping pages at a time.Without going into undue elaboration (so as to not reveal any spoilers), I found the underlying main plot premise to be completely preposterous.Vince, one of the characters returning from the original book, has been transformed from a knight in very tarnished armor to a mean-spirited thug with few - if any - redeeming qualities. In that respect alone, Barclay would have been better off using original characters instead of making this book a ""sequel"".Barclay loves his plot twists. In a good book, that's a good thing. But this time, there was one final twist that, in my opinion, was enough to take it over the top. It was just ... too much.This book just didn't work for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217WLAFQLHMD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451414209#wasThisHelpful","R217WLAFQLHMD1","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this ship a couple of days ago, and my almost-5-year-old munchkin -- my granddaughter -- absolutely loves it.It's the perfect size for her to play with the enclosed Playmobil pirates (very similar to Lego), who apparently are perfect suitors for her little Barbies and Disney princesses. The whole gang piles on board to sail off to their group ""wedding"", which usually takes place at one of her princess castles or Barbie Dream Houses.I find this toy to be pretty impressive. It's not some dinky toy boat; this thing is pretty big, with plenty of room for her to move the figurines around so she can actually have them do things on board, as opposed to other toy ships on which you can only place the figures and not have them do much for lack of space.It's really detailed, right down to the binnacle compass.It was very easy to assemble, taking only about 10 minutes or so. The instructions -- consisting of pictograms -- were easy to understand and follow, with only one exception: be advised that the treasure chest isn't mentioned for some reason. I kept trying to pry the darned thing open, to the point of almost breaking it. FYI, it turns out that if you slide the keyhole escutcheon to the side, the chest unlocks and opens. I'll also publicly admit that it was the MUNCHKIN, not me, who actually figured this out (all that wasted time and money studying engineering in college... go figure).it's very sturdy and I'm sure will stand up to a lot of abuse. Be aware that there are quite a few small parts that I expect will ultimately get lost, at least some of them: swords, knives, a flintlock pistol, hats, pirate booty consisting of individual tiny gold coins. I'd suggest storing the stuff in  the lockable chest or the enclosed barrels, but let's face it: kids will be kids, and at least some of this stuff is going to ""vanish"".Overall, I'd consider this a job extremely well done by Playmobil.

"I've read a couple of Carcaterra's previous books; ""Sleepers"" sticks in my mind, which was a pretty terrific book.On that basis, I bought this one. I wish I hadn't bothered.The basic premise is that an American mob boss's wife and kids are killed in a terrorist takeover of a commercial flight, and he's pretty ticked off about it, wanting vengeance. He enlists the help of a slew of other mob bosses - people running crime syndicates all over the world - in his effort to do so, pitting top-drawer criminals against top-flight terrorists, with pretty predictable results.Okay. Maybe light poolside fare, right?Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there.There's just so much in this book that crosses the line between stretched credibility and the patently absurd.Supposedly, these mobs are so omnipresent and powerful that they almost completely run all private enterprise in, essentially, the world. They ""get a piece"" of every transaction that takes place anywhere. They operate with de facto immunity because law enforcement is so corrupt and in their collective pockets. They control the international financial markets. Each of the bosses is the ultimate ""Don"" of his or her individual country; little gods.Oh, please... Really? We're supposed to buy this? I'm surprised Carcaterra didn't endow them with super powers while he was at it.Then we're supposed to accept the idea that people with this much power are actually going to get personally involved in the gunplay and other action themselves. Isn't that why they have minions? So they can order THEM to do things? When was the last time anyone ever heard of an army general picking up a rifle and running at the enemy lines himself?There's a plot point about a ""betrayal"" that was so obvious that I felt that my intelligence, such as it is, was being insulted. You can see it coming for at least 50 pages.The characterizations are all over the map; a few are pretty three-dimensional, most are shallow and cartoonish.Worse yet, the book doesn't even have a real ""ending"". You're going to have to wait for the obviously-planned second part for a final resolution. I hate that in a book.I was originally going to give this book 2 stars, but as I read what I've written, I think it only deserves one.

"I'm not going to write a story recitation here; you can get a synopsis on the book's Amazon Product Page.Essentially, this book follows Weldon Holland, a poor Southern boy, from his boyhood in the `30s through World War 2 and into his adult life as a self-made successful businessman. By that time he's partnered with his war buddy, married to a concentration camp survivor, and his world is threatened when he refuses to compromise his principles by surrendering control of his company to a wealthy but corrupt local family dynasty.As always, Burke's use of the language is simply masterful; truly a thing to behold. He is the most articulate and descriptive author on the American scene, in my opinion. His descriptive passages, ability to establish mood and setting, and personify his characters is beyond compare. His works are truly ""literature"" in every sense of the word.In many ways this book reminded me of the works of a couple of other authors: Irwin Shaw, particularly the novel ""Rich Man, Poor Man""; and the early works of Harold Robbins, especially ""A Stone For Danny Fisher"". Like those books, this one covers a time period of decades, and centers on the protagonist of a poor boy who makes good.However, in contrast to Burke's usual fare, this book leaves us wanting as to final resolutions, and I think this is a bit of a failure.Burke's usual style is reflective of the real-life fact that we can never really be sure of what other people are thinking, or be crystal clear about their motivations. That's simply a fact of human nature; we can't read minds. However, in the world of storytelling, we have to compromise on that, regardless of how reflective of real life an author wishes to be. After all, the author and readers are sharing a journey into the lives and thoughts of others, with an almost God-view perspective.In his other books, this hasn't been an issue before, at least for me. But in this book, Burke never really resolves some of the major plot points. Who was really behind all the attacks on Weldon and his group? Yes, it was one of the Wisehearts... but WHICH one? Or was it a collaborative effort of all three of them?I don't know, because that's not cleared up. And because of that I found the ending to be very unsatisfying. There was no sense of justice, or retribution, or rehabilitation; whichever would have been appropriate depending on the actor involved.I found the ending itself to be very ... abrupt. After reading several hundred pages of, basically, ""setup"", it's ""resolved"" in about 20 pages? With an explicatory Epilogue? That's like getting all ginned up for a great hamburger, only to find when you go to bite into it that it's a veggie burger.There's another issue I found to be distracting. Throughout the book Burke uses Bonnie and Clyde (yes, that Bonnie and Clyde) as a device he used similarly in his Robicheaux book ""In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead""; a touchstone of dead people - ""spirits"", if you will - that show up at critical moments to help the protagonist clarify his thoughts. Though I think it worked in ""Electric Mist"", I found it to be strained in this book. Maybe it was because in the Robicheaux book the dead people were Southern heroes and honorable men, and Bonnie and Clyde were murderous scum, and therefore inappropriate for our ""hero"" character to continually reference. But for whatever reason, it surely didn't work for me.Anyway, a lot of plusses, a few significant minuses, for an overall rating of 3 ½ stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17D2O6T4DQDC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476710791#wasThisHelpful","R17D2O6T4DQDC5","A2U83VDVJMAB2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U83VDVJMAB2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find carrying around earbuds a hassle.  You either need a separate case for them or they get tangled.  And unless you carry them with you all the time or stash multiple pairs everywhere, you don't always have them when you want them. This case does a good job integrating a decent phone case and decent earbuds. The case provides adequate protection--not as much as the best cases out there, but it's a solid case that will withstand dropping on a hard floor, and much tougher than the inexpensive rubbery skins.  Unlike some cases, this one is easy to get the phone into--it splits into two pieces to allow that. Although the case extends to accommodate the earbuds, it's not much longer than most cases, and no fatter.The earbuds also are adequate for casual listening. Of course you can easily buy much better buds if you're willing to pay, but these really aren't bad.  They come with an in-line microphone and button for answering calls and advancing tracks.  The buds retract promptly and smoothly when you push the button, but it's a good idea to hold them and guide them in; the wires are thin and will probably break eventually if they get snapped into the case over and over.  In fact, the thin wires are the one aspect of the design I question; we'll see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S2EYEHBJ4HOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15U5IW#wasThisHelpful","R1S2EYEHBJ4HOW","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kids can use all the help they can get to become aware of geography; a large proportion of adult Americans are clueless on the subject.  So this modestly-priced item is certainly better than nothing.  However, it has a lot of flaws, too, and for my money, I'd much prefer to spend a little more for something more accurate and durable.This set is quite small, and as a result, it has to try to cram all the countries of the world into it.  Since there are almost 200 officially-recognized nations, it simply omits some.  Many of those included are identified in very small print, making it hard for anyone to read without peering very closely.  In terms of construction, the pieces themselves are thin and (weakly) magnetic and stick to the backing, but they aren't cut out to follow any political borders--areas that include several neighboring countries are lumped together in one piece. I suppose this has the advantage of allowing the user to appreciate that these countries are geographically connected, but it does not allow the user to get an accurate idea of the shape or size of many of the countries.  In fact, most countries' actual borders aren't shown at all; their names just float in the general area where the county is. For example, we can see that many of the countries in the Middle East are neighbors, but can't see the borders of Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Syria or their relative sizes.  Japan and Mongolia look to be about the same size, while in reality the latter is four times the size of the former.

"Few people who aren't already fans are likely to read this, other than perhaps someone doing a research paper, but if you're a Deadhead, you'll find what Kreutzmann has to say interesting. Although there are other Dead memoirs, some of them pretty good, it's different to have one of the members himself, who was there at virtually every performance from the very beginning to the very end, not only offer his recollections but his opinions about other band members, the band's music, and so forth.  It's not great literature, but hopefully no one expects it to be. With the help of his ghost writer, Kreutzmann comes across as thoughtful and insightful.  The narrative is reasonably coherent and articulate.  He covers the band's early years, the Europe tour in '72, the Egypt trip, the Festival Express, and other highlights.  He doesn't shy away from some honest critiques of other band members, although he's gentle about it.  Since it's a memoir, the book is about his personal life as well as about the band's history, and his personal reflections can be touching.  Still, he wisely understands that most readers are much more interested in the Dead than in Bill Kreutzmann.  (Of course, when you're constantly touring with the same crew for thirty years, your life and the band's life overlap a great deal.)  Even a hard-core Deadhead is likely to pick up something from this, and it's a very pleasant way to fill in the gaps in your knowledge of the band's history and the culture from which it emerged.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDRD05610DAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033799#wasThisHelpful","RGDRD05610DAJ","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I take astaxanthin to reduce inflammation and enhance healthy immune response. The two are closely related. It's well known that the immune system is what keeps us from succumbing to illness. Inflammation is a response our body has to a wide range of conditions that it sees as a threat. In the short term, inflammation can be healthy, and is perfectly normal. But chronic inflammation, which can result from a wide range of problems, can lead to a great many conditions. Joint pain from arthritis is an obvious example, but it goes far beyond that. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a form of chronic inflammation. Some believe some cancers result in part from chronic inflammation. In any case, astaxanthin is one supplement that can help reduce chronic inflammation while enhancing immune response.You can decide which supplement to buy based on price, or on the additives, or on dose, etc. All are relevant. I like Jarrow supplements because they're consistently high quality at a fair price. If you read the description they offer about astaxanthin, you can see that they're making a serious effort to inform the consumer, without making up a lot of malarky to get you to buy their product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFF8936IMJI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VCOOYG#wasThisHelpful","R3VFF8936IMJI2","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A lot of duct tape will deteriorate surprisingly quickly when used outdoors; the adhesive dries and separates from the tape. This lasts longer.  The tape itself is thick and tough. I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said you'll need a scissor to cut it--I haven't had a problem tearing off pieces as necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7N4UP9L4BJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5R21XG#wasThisHelpful","R3H7N4UP9L4BJC","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not familiar with Millhauser's work before reading this collection of stories, other than to know that he'd won a Pulitzer for one of his novels.  I was less impressed than I'd hoped.  There's no doubt he's a talented writer who knows his craft, but for the most part I found these stories insubstantial and underwhelming.  For example, one of the longer stories concerns Siddhartha Gautama's youth and his transition from pampered, cloistered prince to spiritual seeker.  It takes an intriguing concept and stretches it out to fill dozens of pages, during which the story progresses very slowly and repetitively.  Ultimately, there was not much to it.  Another story concerns a town experiencing an epidemic of suicides.  Some clever images and turns of phrase, but again, a simple concept spun out into a story that left little impression on me.  In most of the stories I felt little for the characters; it was all about the concept, yet the concepts seemed slight.  Millhauser's fans may enjoy this, but it didn't motivate me to go search out his other work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP5BVGE6CG2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351593#wasThisHelpful","R3GP5BVGE6CG2Y","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black and Decker is best known for its tools, and in my experience their tools aren't of the highest quality.  My experience with a Black and Decker food processor left me unimpressed with its design and sturdiness.  So I wasn't expecting much from this coffee maker.  But I like it in several ways. It does a good job grinding beans so you don't need a separate device for that, and I would never choose to buy ground coffee, which has lost a lot of flavor before it gets into your cup. The grind is adjustable. I like the paperless, permanent filter; although some have complained about it, I much prefer it to having buy and use and dispose of paper filters.  I like that it has a heating element under the pot to keep the coffee warm.  Granted, leaving coffee on a warming plate for a long time will eventually ruin it, but I prefer it to the Cusinart model I have that uses a metal carafe without a heating plate, in which the coffee gets cold in about half an hour and every cup after that has to be put in the microwave to heat it back up.What isn't ideal about this coffee maker is (1) it's big, so be sure you have room for it on your counter top before you buy it, and (2) if you're going to grind beans in it, you need to make at least four cups.  So it's not ideal for a household in which you're going to drink only a couple of cups.  But if you're going to drink a fair amount of coffee in a day, or have an office, it's fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACBL9XDIW8XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HZFK#wasThisHelpful","R3ACBL9XDIW8XW","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are extremely comfortable shoes.  Almost magically so--my feet feel better with the shoes on than off. They're remarkably light, yet seem well made, with decent quality leather, a nice insole, and sewn-on soles.  The soles seem to be made of a material similar to what's used in Crocs, which makes them extremely light, but also prone to wear out.  I always wear a size 10 but have very wide feet, so I ordered the 10EE, since there was no 10E and a number of people said they run small.  A 10E might have been better, because they're a little roomier than I'd like, but they do fit reasonably well.  They also don't have much arch support. But I like them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWL0FFGMD0R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ6RGK8#wasThisHelpful","RMWL0FFGMD0R5","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every foam pillow and mattress is now marketed as ""memory foam.""  This pillow is not memory foam, it's foam rubber.  If you press your hand into it it won't make any impression, but will immediately bounce back.  So if you really want memory foam, keep looking.This pillow is, of course, designed for those using CPAP, and since I don't, I can't comment on the value of the cutouts that are intended to accommodate the hoses.  But what I can say is that the pillow is quite firm--comfortable, but if you like the feeling of your head sinking into something soft, even moderately, this pillow doesn't provide that. Also, although it's described as ""contoured,"" there's really no contour.  One side is slightly wider than the other, but not by much; there's no bulge to fit under your neck as with some other foam pillows, and it's pretty much a solid rectangular block with cutouts.The pillow is covered with a soft removable cover, so although you could use a pillow case you don't have to.  I've been using it for the past couple of months and have found it quite comfortable and my sleep has improved, to my surprise. But if I were choosing one I'd prefer something slightly softer and more contoured.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMFH9PWVC42Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLM47GK#wasThisHelpful","R2SMFH9PWVC42Q","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
