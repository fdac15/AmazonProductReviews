"Someone recommended this to me and I'm so happy I tried it. I've suffered from years of too-thin hair caused by medical reasons and got so sick of looking at fine, thin, flat, wispy hair everyday. I already have some great hair care products to make my thin hair LOOK thicker, but needed my hair to actually GET thicker and re-grow. Well, this stuff seems to do the job it claims to do. I used the first month's supply and my hair is already fuller, the sections that were sparse are filling in and my hair styles so much better because there's more hair to work with. It's also growing faster than before. I just purchased my second box and am going to continue to use it. I'm a major skeptic when it comes to products like this because I don't have time or money to waste, but I noticed the difference in my hair's thickness within 2.5 to 3 weeks after starting the Viviscal. I also received comments about my hair from others who know me as well. Worth the $$ because it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R08PVOVPN9TY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JPJ2ZS#wasThisHelpful","R3R08PVOVPN9TY","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff goes on with the consistency of petroleum jelly and provides a good barrier of protection for very dry or irritated skin, but it's not something that absorbs well like a hand cream.I like to use it mostly for my hands and feet that get really dry as the weather gets colder, but I always put cotton socks and cotton gloves after I apply it, because it's an ointment and I don't want greasiness all over my clothing or bedding. It's also good for any skin irritations, scratches or little scrapes.The touch-free applicator isn't that helpful to me because I'm not going to apply it to the the bottom of my feet and then put some on my lips or face using the same applicator. Ickk. Maybe if you're using the tube for only one purpose (like diaper rash for instance), then the touch-free applicator might be useful. Just mark the tube somehow so you don't forget, lol...The ointment itself is pretty good as long as you don't mind the gooey petroleum consistency, but a regular tube or a tub container might be better if you're using it for multiple purposes. 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LT7QLQR8YPVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR90T0W#wasThisHelpful","R2LT7QLQR8YPVM","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been finding these boards so useful for all sorts of things, from having a tray to set snacks out on, to line a serving tray with, to gather supplies for a recipe I'm making and rolling cookie dough just to name a few. I like being able to have a clean cutting surface when I'm trying to make something quickly and don't have time to wash a big cutting board in between messy ingredients. It's easy to grab one of these to use for veggies and another for meats or other ingredients. They're durable, so it keeps the counter from getting cut or scratched and the surface holds up well so wet foods don't soak through easily. The raised edge helps prevent liquids from seeping over. I chopped up lots of ingredients for a crockpot soup the other day and it held up nicely with no leaks. While they're not a replacement from a full-size cutting board for someone who cooks a lot, they do the job well and are very convenient to keep on hand for miscellaneous cutting/chopping and numerous other purposes in the kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28R4EF4JWREG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSPR34U#wasThisHelpful","R28R4EF4JWREG2","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This label maker has worked great for me so far. When I first opened the box, I was surprised how compact it is for how much you can do with it. It has a built-in carrying handle on the bottom, which makes moving it around easy, but it's still very lightweight.I quickly noticed that it's very well-designed and extremely easy to use. Set-up is as simple as plugging in the A/C adapter, inserting a tape cartridge and turning it on. It's user-friendly the whole way through. There's a Quick-Start guide booklet included that makes it easy to look up anything that's not self-explanatory (like choosing from the HUGE assortment of symbols, pictures/icons, frames, how to save labels and using the Epson label editing software to transfer things from your computer to the label maker).You can make labels for obvious things like file folders or name tags, but you can also make barcode labels, wraps for cables, ribbons for party favor bags, hair bows or pony tail holders, gift tag and decorations for greeting cards just to name a few. If you use the Epson label editing software and connect the label maker to your computer with the included USB cord, you can add your own personal logo or even a photo to your labels. So, if you need a label maker that let's you make more creative and professional-looking labels, this is a great machine.I've made quite a few types of labels and decorative ribbons so far and they look great, plus they're fun to make and don't take much time. It allows you to customize fonts, size, how many lines you want on a label and more. It shows a sample of how the label will look on the screen above the keyboard. If you're happy with that, just hit 'print' and it quickly sends out your label and even cuts if for you.The label maker comes with one black on white sample ½"" tape, so to make things like ribbons, cable wraps or different size labels, you'll have to purchase these additionally. No batteries are included, so if you don't want to use the A/C adapter, you'll need six AA batteries. It also includes a CD with the label editing software (PC only). Mac users need to download it from Epson site. Instructions on this are included.About the only downside is the cost of purchasing additional tape cartridges, especially if you plan to print lots of labels or ribbons. It can add up, but you're paying for the convenience of being able to make stand-out, professional labels easily and quickly from home. If you're a business or freelance professional or just want to be able to create attractive custom labels or tags that include graphics or logos, this is the ideal label maker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LZDW4K9YMLAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBE23VW#wasThisHelpful","R1LZDW4K9YMLAW","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a large sample of this eye cream with another product I bought and have been using it for about 10 days or so now. It's definitely the best eye cream I've ever used. It has a light and airy consistency, sort of like a whipped matte finish gel, which is the best way I can describe it. Since it's matte, there's no shine or greasiness. It immediately makes the under eye area look hydrated, firmer and younger. I even put it on in the morning under my eye makeup and it doesn't cause my eyeliner or mascara to smudge like some eye creams tend to do. Besides the immediate, noticeable improvement, the retinol is great at long-term wrinkle improvement and prevention. I noticed a little sandpapery feel in the areas where I'd been applying it about 3 or 4 days after starting the cream. The retinol had started to gently exfoliate sun-damaged areas of the skin, so I can tell there's more than just superficial improvement. In my experience, retinol works wonders to make skin look younger and this cream has a high retinol concentration. So if you use this cream consistently, the skin cell turnover is increased and there's less wrinkling, a reduction in sun damage and a more youthful eye area. It's also a good product for women as young as their 20's because it helps to prevent wrinkling around the eye area before it even starts. I rarely buy anything but drugstore moisturizers and creams, but this product is one that's worth it's price tag. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9AMWI9ZROA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9OCLLS#wasThisHelpful","RD9AMWI9ZROA5","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting phone; there are lots of things I like and a few things that annoy me about it. This is my second Windows phone and being someone who's more used to Apple products, I have to say I like the Windows phone OS better than I expected. It took a little time to get used to and appreciate the differences between iOS and Windows, but though they're different, Windows is user-friendly and very easy to customize the phone to suit what things you use most often and what your preferences are.First the good...I love the camera on this phone. It's the best of any phone I've had because the pictures are sharp, bright and clear. There are front and rear facing cameras. As someone who enjoys photography, I appreciate being able to take high-quality photos on my phone when I don't have my camera with me.The phone comes with a matching slip-on cover, one screen protector and ear buds. When I ordered this phone, I assumed I'd have to get these things seperately, but I was pleasantly surprised they were included and it saved me the time and money of ordering additional accessories.The size of this phone is nice, yet it still feels fairly lightweight. I have a smaller smartphone that weighs more than this one.The screen color is bright and vivid and the sound is also good when I'm listening to music or videos.I'm using it with AT&T service and so far, so good. Good sound quality and no dropped calls.The dual-SIM card slots is another useful feature for some people.The battery life is pretty good compared to other phones I have.Like many smartphones, there's limited internal memory, so it's necessary to purchase a storage card. Here's an example of a couple that work well with this phone:SanDisk 32GB Ultra Class 10 Micro SDHC up to 48MB/s with Adapter (SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A) [Newest Version]Samsung Electronics 32GB EVO Micro SDHC with Adapter Up to 48MB/s Class 10 Memory Card (MB-MP32DA/AM)Things like apps, music downloads, photos and videos can be stored on this card and you won't max out your phone's memory. A 32GB card is more than enough for the average user. It's easy to set up so things automatically are stored to this card instead of on your phone's internal memory.A couple things that could be improved on this phone:-The Windows 'home' icon near the bottom of the phone is small and light/medium gray in color. I have perfect 20/20 vision and it seems a little hard to see against the black of the phone. It's especially hard to see in low light or dark conditions. The same goes for the back arrow and the search icons that are on either side of the Windows home icon. These should definitely be lit up more. On my other Windows phone, they're lit bright white and easy to see day or night.-The most annoying thing about this phone is the way the touchscreen works. Often when I'm scrolling down the home screen or through the list of apps on the phone, apps that I happen to touch as I'm scrolling along will open unintentionally. I'll have to close the app and resume what I'm doing, but this happens often and it seems like the screen is too sensitive or something. But, at other times, I'll have to press hard to get things to work. For example, I was deleting photos and had to press the trash icon very hard to get it to delete. I haven't experiened this with other phones I've had, Windows or otherwise.So my overall opinion of this phone is fairly positive but the touchscreen issue is the biggest drawback for me. There are lots of nice features like the high-quality photos, the light weight for a large screen size, the 2 SIM card slots, the included accessories, etc., but for me to really like this phone the touch screen would need to be improved because it's annoying for apps to open as I'm gently scrolling down the screen. It never happens with my other Windows phone, so it can't just be the way I'm using it. I'm not sure why it doesn't happen constantly and I notice it when I'm doing some things more than others, but it continues to be a problem.Though I'm giving it 4 stars, I'd probably give it between a 3.5 to 3.8 if I could due to the frequent annoyance of the touchscreen. If my opinion changes as I used the phone more, I'll update my rating/review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16O4QQ6SLC9I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQGFQ7C#wasThisHelpful","R16O4QQ6SLC9I7","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this speaker to use with a laptop and an iPad Mini and it worked perfectly with both. It comes partially charged, so I hooked the included USB cord to my computer and it fully charged in under 30 minutes. It's just a small, hockey puck sized speaker, but the sound quality is quite good and projects well around the room. It says the Bluetooth works up to about 30 feet, but I was able to go to another room in the house (more than 30 feet) and still had full sound. Operation is simple: just charge, pair with Bluetooth on your device, turn on and that's it. There's +/- for volume adjustment. It comes with an instruction guide and a nice black velvety drawstring carrying case for easy portability. The battery charge lasts for about 4 hours. It's a convenient little accessory for having a speaker nearby, rather than moving the laptop, computer or tablet. The size makes it perfect for travel too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AFAGNVXR6Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLJ55XG#wasThisHelpful","R27AFAGNVXR6Y2","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this phone to replace an older AT&T GoPhone and am loving it so far. I considered getting the new iPhone, but didn't want a contract or to pay full retail price for an unlocked iPhone. This Nokia phone seemed to have the features I wanted at a fraction of the iPhone price, so after using it for about a month now, I'm so glad I got this phone. It's a bargain for how much it has to offer.I never had a Windows phone before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at how many things you can customize on this phone compared to the other phone I had. Icons of different apps and features can be moved around, resized and you can choose which ones you want and don't want on your main screen. It's easy to customize everything from ringtones, backgrounds, security/passwords, apps, storage, and much more. From the 'User Settings Menu', you can totally personalize the phone to suit your preferences. I use mostly Apple products, so the Windows interface took some getting used to, but it's pretty simple to use and is easy to customize the phone to what features/apps are most important to you.The phone itself works great: clear reception on calls, no dropped calls, easy to adjust volume, no technical problems or freezing. Videos and YouTube play nicely and the speakers project sound well. This is the second Nokia phone I've had and like the first, this one works well and is trouble-free. I've been using it a lot and it's never frozen or not worked when I need it.I did find out that this phone doesn't have too much internal storage space and after adding some apps, photos, videos, etc, the phone was getting close to its capacity. I purchased a Professional Ultra SanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC Nokia Lumia 635 card is custom formatted for high speed, lossless recording! Includes Standard SD Adapter. (UHS-1 Class 10 Certified 30MB/sec) seperately. 32GB seems like more than enough space, so now I can add lots of apps, take photos, video and download music without worrying about the phone's storage being maxed out. In the phone's user settings, you can choose what things (like apps, for example) that you want to automatically be saved to the storage disk instead of on the phone. I think this option comes up when you first put the disk into the back of the phone and the phone automatically recognizes you added a disk.The other accessories that I purchased for this phone are:Fosmon Nokia Lumia 635 SLIM-Fit Case [DURA FRO] Flexible TPU Cover - Retail Packaging (Black)Good basic protection for everyday use.Fosmon Anti-Glare (Matte) Screen Protector Shield for Nokia Lumia 635 - Retail Packaging (3 Pack)Cuts down on fingerprints, glare, easy to put on and keep the screen scratch-free.SOGAÂ® Rapid Auto Vehicle Micro USB Car Charger Adaptor for Nokia Lumia 510, 520, 521, 525, 530, 630, 635, 810, 822, 900, 920, 925, 928, 929 Icon, 930, 1020, 1520 Cell PhoneVery convenient if you're out and your battery gets low.These have all worked great with my phone.There are just a few things I don't like about this phone. It feels sort of heavy if I'm holding it for a while with longer calls. Maybe I'm just not used to a smartphone or should get a bluetooth headphone, but it's just something I noticed.The battery life is okay, but seems like it could be better. I'm charging at least every other day and I'm not someone who uses my phone constantly. If I use the phone a lot, I charge it once a day. This is one of the reasons the car charger is helpful.If you love taking selfies, this probably isn't the phone for you because there's no front-facing camera. The photo quality is good, but not great.There have a been a couple occasions where an app didn't work with the phone, which is more of a Windows issue than a problem with the phone itself. For example, I downloaded the U-Stream app, but it wouldn't work. Annoying, but in general, most of the apps I downloaded work as they're supposed to.For the price, I feel like this phone is a steal. I did quite a bit of research prior to ordering and couldn't find another smartphone in this price range with as many features and good quality.I really like having a good quality smartphone with so many useful features without dealing with a contract. I definitely recommend this phone for someone who wants a versatile smartphone at a good price. 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFFDBVVOXTPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBFFSNM#wasThisHelpful","R3VFFDBVVOXTPX","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My skin tends to be high-maintenence: combination oily/dry, sensitive, breaks out with some products and changes with the seasons. Because of these things, I have a very hard time finding products that make my skin look good without adding extra shine, are overly drying or contain ingredients that cause breakouts. I've tried expensive department store products as well as drugstore brands and have only had mixed results. This Morea Naturals serum is really a good fit for my skin. My complexion immediately feels smoother, more toned and hydrated, but without added greasy shine that I find in other products. I use this serum in the evening after using my cleanser and in the morning before I put on my sunscreen and foundation. My skin looks great and has a nice, even finish to it as if I'm wearing a primer. It minimizes pores too. I love that it's unscented (I have alleriges to products with perfumes) and contains natural ingredients. Also no parabens and cruelty-free. It's a good price for this size bottle too. This is a product that I'll continue to use because of the improvements I see in my skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDLPR1EMHXEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWGCC84#wasThisHelpful","R2SDLPR1EMHXEP","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I used a screen protector on my phone and I just love these. It was easier to put on than I expected and it gives the phone screen a matte, anti-glare finish. It cuts down on fingerprints too. The pack comes with three protectors, a lint cloth and a plastic card to help ensure a bubble-free application. Just be sure your phone screen is completely clean and dust-free before applying. I used a flashlight to make sure there was no dust or fingerprints. Or, put them on in a brightly lit or sunny room. Very happy with this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156L23UA908VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1FS8I0#wasThisHelpful","R156L23UA908VY","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pillow is dense and substantial, but the medium-softness memory foam has just the right balance of support and cushioning for the head and neck. It keeps my neck in the right position for sleeping which seems to reduce much of the neck and shoulder pain I've been waking up with for a while. I typically sleep on my back, but occasionally turn to the side and this pillow is equally comfortable for both. I like the queen size pillow, since I've found many standard size memory foam pillows to be way too small. The pillow does smell mildly like kerosene or something at first, but it seems to fade after a couple days. I put the pillow inside a protector and case, so that also makes the scent less obvious. If it weren't for that, I'd likely give it 5 stars because it is extremely comfortable, is a nice size, has helped with my neck pain and stays cool unlike some memory foam pillows. It also comes in a re-useable zipper case for storage/travel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LCJS4U25YFSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043L17NG#wasThisHelpful","R2LCJS4U25YFSG","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discovered that the Nokia 635 doesn't come with all that much storage space, so I got this microdisk so my apps, photos, videos and such could be stored on the disk to free up space on my phone. It's a super tiny disk that fits inside the phone near the battery. I think 32GB is a decent size for most people unless you have tons of videos, photos or apps on your phone. It's easy to move apps and other things that are already stored on your phone onto this disk. It's supposed to help improve the battery life on the phone and make saving pics/videos faster and have less chance of losing them. So far, it seems to be working good with my phone. It was easy to install and the phone recognized the card right away. It comes with an SD adapter too. Yes, it's kind of expensive for such a tiny disk, but without it, the Nokia's storage space can fill up really fast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCB0JBSMCPF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9973372883#wasThisHelpful","RSCB0JBSMCPF9","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This slim-fitting case is just what I wanted for my Nokia 635. It fits perfectly, stays on, adds some grip so that phone doesn't slip from my hand and doesn't interfere with the phone's buttons/slots/holes/camera. The back is matte finish and the sides and front edges are glossy, so it looks nice. There might not be as much protection if the phone is dropped as with some of the cases that have a bigger, bulkier fit, but it seems like it will protect the phone from scratches, bumps and basic every day use. For a slim-fitting case that fits, it's just right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVX4T3M47PA12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L87I1UA#wasThisHelpful","RVX4T3M47PA12","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty nice comforter set for the price. I like the fun zig-zag pattern of the comforter and it actually goes with quite a few colors of bedrooms. It's a light to light/medium weight comforter that feels soft, airy and cozy. I'd think it would be good for most seasons, though it might be too light for cold winter nights where an extra blanket or two might be needed.I like that this set comes with two sets of sheets (2 different coordinating colors), so one is available when the other one is being washed/dried. There are two pillowcases of each color (taupe and bluish-lavender) and two shams that match the comforter so you won't ever have a shortage of pillowcases. Everything coordinates very well in this set. The sheets wash and dry well and come out of the dryer without too many wrinkles. The fabric is a soft, smooth micro-fiber. It has a silky feel and look to it.The whole set including the comforter arrives in a re-useable mesh drawstring hamper which is useful for storage or to use as a laundry bag. I'm using it as a clothes hamper and it's just perfect and doesn't take up too much space.Everything in this set arrived in good shape. There were some wrinkles in the comforter which is to be expected. There were some random loose fuzzy strings on the comforter (not attached, just fuzz) and I used a lint-roller to neaten it up on the bed.I'd say it's a fairly good quality comforter set for the price, though it's not a fancy, luxurious, last-forever set by any means. For a teen, college student, spare bedroom or just a nice looking everyday full/queen comforter set with an affordable price, this fits the bill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PLLPSWR0SDKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSPIKE6#wasThisHelpful","R2PLLPSWR0SDKW","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm loving this air purifier & sound machine so far. I have severe indoor dust and mold allergies, plus I need some kind of white noise to help block out sounds in the house while I sleep, so this helps solve both of those problems in one machine.It comes mostly assembled, just put in the two filters, plug it in and it's ready to go. Though it comes with a complete user guide, I found the buttons on top of the unit very simple and intuitive to use right from the start. The unit is very attractive, surprisingly compact and the neutral colors are pleasant and should go with most decors.The air purifier can be used either alone or at the same time as the white noise/sleep sounds. I really like the option of running just one or both together.The sound machine has six different sounds: rain, two different lullabies, ocean, crickets and white noise. The volume can be adjusted up and down and there's also a 15, 30 and 60-minute timer. The sounds are all soothing, relaxing and peaceful, no matter what your age. You can't help but de-stress and feel calmer listening to the sound of the rain or rolling ocean waves. The crickets chirping on a quiet night is pretty cool too. For a baby or young child, the two versions of the lullaby (Schubert and Brahms) are a nice feature. The sounds and white noise setting (sounds like a constant static) are also perfect for blocking out other noise in the house or outside when you're trying to get some sleep. The volume goes up to a decent level. It's not quite as loud as the average box fan on a high setting for example, but it is very effective at blocking background noise, especially considering this is a fairly small machine. If you turn the air purifier on the highest setting (3), that adds quiet a bit of a rushing air sound if you want something louder to block background or outdoor noise. You can also lower the volume to the lowest setting if you want just a light, repetitive sound to help you sleep.The air purifier has three settings (low, medium and high). It's almost silent on #1, a light fan sound on #2 and a louder fan type sound on 3. It has two filters: a true HEPA (for pollen, pet hair, dust and smoke) and an odor filter (VOC's, pet odors, musty smells and cooking odors). The fan from the air purifier sends air upward from the unit, so it helps circulate the air in the room but you don't feel air blowing like you do with a fan. I noticed it helped the air in my bedroom smell fresher after running it for short time. It helps pull dust out of the air, so I find less dust on electronics and counter tops. There's a 1, 4 and 8 hour timer setting for the air purifier. There's also a filter replacement indicator. Because my indoor allergies can get really bad, I love that this machine sucks dust and dirt out of the air so I can sleep better at night.There's a 3-year limited warranty on this product. Just going by how it looks, it seems well-made and high quality throughout. The odor filter lasts 6 months and the HEPA filter lasts one year. This air purifier comes in an extremely sturdy box with handle slots for easy carrying. The design and information on the box explains everything you need to know about the product and its many uses.I'm already breathing and sleeping better thanks to this machine. I even run it during the day at times if I need to have some quiet, relaxing sounds to feel calmer and less stressed out. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4YML7IB6P2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTGM9DA#wasThisHelpful","R3C4YML7IB6P2X","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 2014 Collector's Holiday Barbie is beautiful and festive. Her long, flowy red and golden gown is gorgeous. I really like the sparkly gold eyeshadow for an added touch, her makeup is pretty, nice hairstyle, red nail polish and ornate gold necklace. Her entire look just radiates holiday glamour and style. There's also a stand for display that's included. The box she comes in is lovely too, red with fancy gold trim and designs. She's perfect for a Barbie doll collector or as a gift for a girl who appreciates Barbies. She's not like a regular Barbie with arms that bend, so if you're getting this doll for a child, make sure they're old enough to appreciate a collector's edition Barbie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZZQNZJF8LS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDMY58Y#wasThisHelpful","R7ZZQNZJF8LS8","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked this case at first when I put it on my new phone because it was very easy to put on, fits well, seems very protective all around and has an attractive look, but by the first night I noticed a small gap on the side where the rubber and plastic meet. I was able to push it back on and all seemed fine, but it kept happening. It was gapping on both sides by day two.

"These liners arrived at the perfect time for me. I recently cleaned the inside of my refrigerator and lined the shelves with paper towels in an attempt to keep them clean. That didn't work so well, but I hate having mess from food, drinks or cans of pet food all over the refrigerator. When I saw these shelf liners, I had to try them.They're made of a soft, but heavy weight fabric that feels like thick felt. It's absorbant, which is good for containing spills. They're also reversible and both sides have an interesting pattern. I cut them to the size of my refrigerator shelves and now I don't have to waste time wiping off food spills or crumbs. I tried putting a few of these through the wash and found them to hold up well. I dried them by laying them flat on a drying rack since they might shrink in the dryer. They're not stick-on liners, so they do shift a little on occasion, but it's not a problem. For the refrigerator, I cut them so they're wide enough to slightly curve over the side edges of the shelves, so they stay in place well.Now I plan to try these for lining my bathroom drawers and some cabinet shelves in my kitchen where I keep my plates and glasses since they add cushioning to the surface. There are so many possible uses for these liners, even to protect glass or ceramics for packing. The 2-pack covers quite a bit of space depending on the size of what you're lining. I'm so glad I found these. They're already cutting down on my cleaning time and the color and pattern look great in my refrigerator.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CXX57M0LXR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVMOKJ0#wasThisHelpful","R12CXX57M0LXR4","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got these as replacement heads for my Sonicare brush and am very happy with them. They clean very well, are firm enough, but don't irritate my gums or cause sensitivity. My teeth are whiter and it removes plaque so they actually look like they were cleaned in the dentist's office. After my last Philips replacement heads wore out, I went back to my regular non-electric toothbrush for a while and my teeth started looking stained and getting plaque. As soon as I got these Diamondclean brush heads, my teeth looked great again after just a couple brushings. Definitely worth the price if you want cleaner teeth and healthier gums. I used to have a problem with sensitive gums that would bleed almost every time I brushed and flossed and once I started using the Sonicare, it never happened again. I will get these replacement heads again next time I need them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRH27F6Q9VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086VIA1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3GRH27F6Q9VB","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to replace an older breadmaker of another brand. I'm mostly liking it so far, but there are a couple of things that could be better.Here's a breakdown of my main thoughts about this breadmaker:Assembly - Easy and fast. I washed the breadmaker bin and paddle with sudsy, warm water, put them together and they go into the breadmaker unit easily. There's nothing else to assemble.Menu - The digital menu is easy to use. You select the menu setting for the particular bread you're making, the weight of the loaf you want to make (1lb, 1.5 lb or 2 lb) and the crust color setting. I found the crust color setting a little confusing and ended up with very dark crust with a few loaves. I will comment more about this later in the review. There's also a start/stop button. If you need to stop the breadmaker for some reason before it automatically finishes, just hold down the start/stop button and it turns off.Quality - The overall breadmaker seems to be high quality. The materials are nice, it's attractive and sleek on the countertop, it operates quiety, it doesn't travel on the countertop, everything feels solid and like it will last a long time.Bread Pan - It's like a bucket with a handle, so it's easy to lift out and hold. It gets hot, so either use pot holders to remove the bread pan when it's done, or wait until it's cool enough to touch. The bread comes out of the pan easily. I just turned it upside down on a cutting board and just tapped it until it came out.Cleaning - The breadmaker, pan and paddle are easy to clean. The breadmaker can be dusted out if you get flour or a few breadcrumbs inside the base. Either use a cloth or carefully turn the whole unit upside down and pour out any loose crumbs so they don't burn the next time you make bread. I cleaned the pan and dough paddle by hand with warm water and dish detergent. It can't be put in the dishwasher.Bread - It took some experimenting since I was used to the much older breadmaker I've used for years. I tried making several different types of bread from the included recipe book and the results varied. The loaves were mostly good, but the crust color setting selector was confusing to me. It's just a small icon and I couldn't tell which was the lightest or darkest setting. The crust of two of the loaves I made was way too dark, nearly burned. This was the biggest issue I had with the breadmaker. The bread itself was good and had a nice texture to it. There's a window on top so you can see how the bread is doing without opening the lid. It's helpful unless it gets steamed up. Everything is automated, so once you push the start button, there's nothing to do except wait for your bread to be done. Some recipes have ingredients to be added after the initial mixing, so there's a specific beep that happens to let you know when to add these things. It's helpful to be around to check on the bread dough in the early stage of the mixing cycle in case it's too dry or moist and you need to add more liquid or flour. I didn't find this necessary, but every recipe is different, so it helps to open the lid or look through the window just in case.Gluten Free - When I first saw this breadmaker, I thought it was only for making gluten-free breads. It's basically a regular breadmaker that also has several settings for making gluten-free bread and cakes. There are eight gluten-free recipes in the included recipe book. The book gives instructions and tips for making gluten-free breads and cakes. If you're making any gluten-free recipes, you'll need to buy special gluten-free dry yeast, a gluten-free pre-mix and other assorted ingredients and then just select one of the gluten-free settings.Jam/Compote - This is an easy way to make homemade fruit jam with relatively few ingredients. I made the strawberry jam and it took about an hour. Afterward, I put it in the refrigerator for about another hour to let it firm up. Very tasty on a slice of fresh, warm bread.Other things - Though I didn't try making all of these, this breadmaker can make pizza dough, lemon cade, rum cake and even pasta.Overall thoughts - I like this breadmaker because it's fairly versatile in the kinds of things you can make. It's well-made, attractive and easy to operate and clean. I personally had some trouble with the crust color setting which ruined two or three of the loaves I made and I still can't get the crust quite light enough for my preference. The medium setting was definitely too dark for me. I am still experiementing with taking the bread out earlier so this doesn't happen. I will update my review once I get this figured out. I don't need to have gluten-free bread, but I like having the option in case I'm making bread or cake for someone who is gluten-sensitive. To get nit-picky, my older breadmaker has the nice feature of a cooling fan that runs once the bread baking is finished so the pan is cool to touch and the bread is easier to handle without using pot holders. I'd like this breadmaker more if it had that feature. I was hoping this breadmaker would be a little more fool-proof in terms of turning out perfect loaves every time, but after a couple weeks I'm still experimenting in getting the bread and crust exactly how I want it. Not sure if this is an issue with the breadmaker or just because I'm used to using a different one. The current price seems about right considering the quality and features of this breadmaker.Based on my experience so far with it, I'd give it between 3.5 and 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27K3G05822AYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVSRIDG#wasThisHelpful","R27K3G05822AYO","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two cats have been eating Natural Balance products almost exclusively since they were kittens. The few times I picked up another type or brand of food, I switched back to Natural Balance because this is the food that's the most satisfying for them, keeps them full and in their best health. Until the last several months, they were eating Natural Balance Reduced Calorie Formula. My cats are both 6 years old, neutered, strictly indoor and only moderately active, so they need to be on a lower calorie food to keep them from putting on the pounds. I feed them both dry and canned foods. They both love this Fat Cats formula and I had no problem switching them from the Natural Balance Reduced Calorie to this. Apparently, it tastes just as good because there's never a leftover morsel in my house. I like this food for them for a variety of reasons:1) It keeps their weight down when fed in moderation according to the bag or how much your vet tells you to feed your cat.2) It's still satisfying despite being lower calorie. With some other brands of 'diet' cat foods, my cats were always hungry.3) Their coats look very shiny, I even get comments on how shiny, soft and healthy their coats looks, so obviously this food is giving them the vitamins and nutrients they need. One of my cats used to eat another brand of a low-calorie cat food and started getting dandruff and very dry skin. There seems to be a good balance of low calorie and enough fat for their skin health in this particular food.4) My cats are never sick. They only see the vet for checkups, shots and the occasional dental cleaning. No throwing up, diarrhea or smelly stools. Saves me on vet bills!5) Quality ingredients. Just read the bag compared to some other types of food, especially foods from the grocery store. There aren't added fillers or junk in this food. Fillers and junk just cause allergies, stomach or skin problems. This food has kept my cats healthy.If you are currently feeding your cat another type or brand of food, make the transition easier for them by adding a little of this to their current food over a period of several days to a week. That will help prevent any stomach issues as your cat adjusts to a different food. Some cats have more sensitive systems when it comes to diet changes.After feeding this food to my cats for several months now, this is the only dry food I buy since they're doing great. This 15-pound bag is huge and will last a long time even with my two big male cats. And, 15 pounds of food with real meat and high-quality ingredients lasts longer than 15 pounds of a low-quality cat food. They eat less because it's nutrient dense. It's so nice to have it delivered right to my doorstep rather than lugging it from the pet store. My cats and I love this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32V34QL9IY8SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVUEWVG#wasThisHelpful","R32V34QL9IY8SV","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think it's essential to keep an emergency kit in your vehicle just in case you ever need it. Although this one includes a good, basic selection of items that one might need in an emergency, the quality of most of the items is just okay at best.First, 63 of the items are in the small ziplock bag containing first aid supplies. Then there are 25 small cable ties, so we're down to only 16 other items which makes a 104-item thing a little misleading in my opinion.I like the idea of the tire inflator, but after researching the BellAire 500 Tire Inflator that comes in this kit, the reviews on it aren't all that good. It seems like it might take a considerable amount of time to inflate a car or truck tire using this inflator.I do like that jumper cables are included, but I can't tell the quality of these based on just looks. They are much lighterweight than those in my AAA emergency kit.The other items are a blanket (feel like it's made of felt), a basic rain poncho, some thin cotton gloves (no grip on them), tire sealant spray, a small bungee cord, 25 cable ties, a plastic emergency 'Help' sign, a flashlight and batteries, a screwdriver and a few more things. It would be helpful if it included an emergency whistle and an aluminum blanket.Having a kit like this in your car or truck is better than nothing, but I think the cost is a little high considering the so-so quality of many of these items. It might be more cost-effective to pick up a collection of items individually and throw them in a bag or find an emergency kit with higher quality items. Comparing this kit item by item to the current emergency kit that I keep in my car that cost about $10 or $15 more, this one doesn't quite measure up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7OG7MWFV568/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INTQ3YC#wasThisHelpful","R1H7OG7MWFV568","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always trying to find things to help my dry, calloused feet, from pumice stones to sloughing creams or plain old Vaseline. This Dr. Scholl's foot smoother has helped a little, but I was hoping it would make a bigger difference than it did.On the positive side, the unit is easy to hold and very comfortable to use. The on/off switch works well. The rolling sander feels like very fine, smooth sandpaper against the feet. It's not uncomfortable at all. If you press too hard, it automatically shuts off so it seems like a very safe product to use.As far as removing callouses, it definitely smoothes callouses and helps remove superficial dead, dry skin on the feet, but I think it's too gentle of a product to help with moderate to heavy callouses or very dry/rough feet. It may work better with continued use over time, but it's not something that you can use a few times and expect to have baby smooth, callous-free feet. It's probably better suited for people with mild to moderate callouses or just to help rough/dry feet feel smoother. If you use it fairly often, you can probably prevent bad callouses from forming and keep your feet looking smooth and nice.I've been using it after my feet are clean and fully dry following a shower. When I'm done, I apply a moisturizing cream. I see a mild difference from using this foot smoother, but the smoothness seems temporary and the results aren't much better than with my 99-cent pumice block. Although I really like the idea of this product, I wish the pumicing action was more intense so I could see results faster. I also wish Dr. Scholl's would offer various types of replacement rollers (like sensitive skin, normal, extra-strength), so people could customize how light or intense of a smoother they need for their feet.I'm going to continue to use this and will update this review if I see an improvement, but for now I can only give it 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4AMOT5UCS7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3H4YN2#wasThisHelpful","RG4AMOT5UCS7D","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these on Amazon at a really low price so I figured if they didn't work, it was no big loss. Surprisingly, they do work better than I expected. The scent is very light and subtle (but nice), especially after the first few days, but I have noticed they do neutralize odors. I put them in a smallish room that has a somewhat musty smell from old carpeting and these sticks have helped reduce the odor by at least 75%. This isn't a powerful air-freshener or something that puts out a constant perfumey fragrance like a plug-in, but they do seem to help reduce odors to some extent. I notice their scent, but it's very light. I have a bad perfume allergy and these don't bother me at all. I would likely buy more of these if I got a good price, for small rooms, bathrooms, a room where pets stay or a few in the kitchen. They don't work miracles by any means, but I do notice a positive difference in the room I currently keep them.Update: Scent has faded a bit after a couple of weeks. I don't notice the linen scent at all unless I'm fairly close to where I keep them, but the room smells cleaner and odors are barely noticeable.

"I'm so over cords on headphones, so I got these to be able to listen to music or podcasts from my tablet or laptop and have the freedom to move around without worrying about a cord. The pair I got didn't arrive fully charged and wouldn't turn on, so I hooked them up to my computer with the included USB cord. It took less than an hour to get them 100% charged. They paired with bluetooth to both my computer and tablet very easily. I'm able to walk around to several different rooms around the house and still be connected. The headphones are very comfortable and lightweight enough that they're not distracting to wear. The sound quality is pretty good. Not as crystal clear as other headphones I have, but for the everyday user, they're probably good enough. The control buttons are on the side of the right headphone, so the volume and other controls can be easily accessed. The plastic case they come in can be used for storage.

"Very happy with my Sport ID bracelet. The small fits perfectly and the clear color bracelet isn't very noticeable, so I can wear it with just about anything without having an obvious bracelet on. It's lightweight, comfortable and I mostly forget it's on. It's waterproof, so I can leave it on in the shower or when I'm swimming.Signing up with the website and creating the online medical profile was easy and took just a few minutes. I like the fact that the online profile allows me to have much more information than with a regular medical bracelet that has to be engraved with just a few lines of info. The premium profile is free for the first year. After that, it reverts to the basic profile (a little less info) or you can pay $9.95 annually to keep the premium profile, which isn't a bad deal at all.I tried scanning the QR code and it worked perfectly to bring up my profile on the site. I definitely feel safer knowing that if I ever have an emergency, my medical info, allergies and emergency contacts would be available to doctors. Worth every penny for the peace of mind it provides.Update: Be careful when applying spray-on sunscreen when you're wearing this.

"I have noticed an improvement in my cats' teeth when I feed this to them regularly. One of my cats in particular has terrible teeth and gums despite professional teeth cleanings in the vet's office, so I have to work extra hard to make sure his teeth are clean. He hates having his teeth brushed as much as I hate brushing them, so this food is an easier way to reduce some of the plaque build-up before it can irritate his gums. Both of my cats enjoy the taste of this food. It's not a diet food, so I alternate it with a reduced calorie formula dry food for my chubby cat so he doesn't put on weight.

"I used after the Nioxin #4 shampoo to help with thinning hair. The minty scent is refreshing and combined with the Nioxin shampoo, my hair did thicken up after using it for a while. But, this is not a heavy duty conditioner that leaves the hair super soft and hydrated. My hair was always a little hard to comb through after using this, so I ended up switching to a deep conditioner for my everyday conditioner because my hair is dry and prone to tangles. As a light conditioner for people with thinning hair this works well, but if you have long or dry hair, or hair that's generally hard to comb through after showering, it may not be hydrating enough for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHDE7X226B3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LJGRG6#wasThisHelpful","R1CHDE7X226B3D","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As you can probably see, it has a yoga area on the side. You just velcro in your mat. I was able to do this easily, even with my may in its bag/ carrying case.

"At first, I could not get the speakers to work. There were not included instructions other than the photo on the back. What I found was that:1. The cable was not plugged in all the way to the second speaker. This was resolved by unplugging the cable and plugging it back in.2. The volume was not high enough for the speakers. Once I increased the volume, everything worked as expected.These produced a great sound (once I had them hooked up correctly), and the light show IS really, really fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCMK6G4CK712/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WA89JBG#wasThisHelpful","R1YCMK6G4CK712","A2CUDVHG6K5HML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CUDVHG6K5HML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly do not know how I did not have these earlier. I have been using the paper ones for my entire life, but I was offered a coupon code in exchange for an honest review, so I thought I would try them out. It just makes so much more sense to use these. The paper was such a hassle. It would get stuck in the cupcakes, stuck on the pan, just stuck everywhere. These were easy to take out of the pan, easy to take off of the cupcakes, and easy to clean. My kids absolutely LOVE them. My daughter actually asked if she could keep them (she is 4, so I am not sure what she planned to do with them, but she thought they were much fun). My 12 year old keeps asking if we can make the cupcakes with them again, so they were a huge hit. Makes baking so much more fun and easier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HDWH635MV3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLF65SO#wasThisHelpful","R23HDWH635MV3W","A2CUDVHG6K5HML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CUDVHG6K5HML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"House Next Door was a book recommended to me last summer by one of my online ""mom"" groups. I have to say, the beginning of the book seemed fairly solid. I enjoyed the general plot line, and the first half of the book (approximately) was a decent read. I was able to get through it at a steady pace, and was enjoying the book. Then, about midway through, things took a turn for the worse, and the book went downhill fast. I did not enjoy the ending (I thought it was rushed and lacking), and it just seemed kind of to run out of steam. The characters never really went anywhere over the course of the book, and they all seemed very one-dimensional, especially everyone outside of the main focus of the book.However, if you like books about haunted houses, it is a decent read. It is easy to get through, hard to put down, and will keep you reading. I would say it is a good book to read when you are relaxing on vacation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6TOXOTFCCMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W5MI62#wasThisHelpful","R1T6TOXOTFCCMY","A2CUDVHG6K5HML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CUDVHG6K5HML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It kept me entertained for my 2 1/2 hour flight, and was compelling enough that it kept my attention.

"Anton Corbijn's ""A Most Wanted Man"" is a well-made, suitably depressing adaptation of a John Le Carre novel. Set in modern-day Hamburg, it stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gunter Bachmann, a cynical, hard-drinking intelligence officer heading a special anti-terrorism unit. His latest assignment is to track the movements of Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin), a suspected Chechen terrorist who has literally washed up in Hamburg for reasons unknown. Others involved in the story include Annabel Richter (Rachel McAdams), an idealistic civil rights lawyer who tries to help Issa; Tommy Brue (Willem Dafoe), a shady banker who holds the secret of Issa's presence in Hamburg; Martha Sullivan (Robin Wright), a CIA operative with her own agenda; and Dr. Abdullah (Homayoun Ershadi), a Muslim philanthropist who may be funding more sinister projects than hospitals and orphanages.Corbijn and screenwriter Andrew Bovell tip us off early, via the film's palpable sense of impending doom, that nothing good will emanate from the collision of these people. Nevertheless, the film is compelling, particularly as a showcase for excellent actors playing fascinating characters. As sad as ""A Most Wanted Man"" is, the saddest thing about it is that Hoffman, who so masterfully inhabits the skin of Gunter Bachmann, is no more. This is one of Hoffman's finest performances, and it is unbearable to think that, except for a handful of movies still awaiting release, we will not see him again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IN2WE4IRDPIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4LP7LU#wasThisHelpful","R3IN2WE4IRDPIF","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wendy Moffat's ""A Great Unrecorded History"" records in detail the sexual life of E.M. Forster, in an attempt to show how his homosexuality influenced his writing and thought. (Of course we already know the saddest influence it had on Forster: for the last 46 years of his life, he published no fiction, though he continued sporadically to write it.) Moffat tells us many interesting details about the men in Forster's life--especially the great love of his life, Bob Buckingham--as well as his occasionally rocky friendhsips with other gay authors, such as J.R. Ackerley and C.P. Cavafy.In many ways, ""A Great Unrecorded History"" reminds me of Neil McKenna's book, ""The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde."" Both books do an excellent job of connecting their subjects' sexuality with their philosophies and bodies of work. However, Moffat is a much better writer than McKenna--McKenna never uses one word when ten will do--and she is also much less prurient than McKenna. Moffat's work doesn't replace that of P.N. Furbank, any more than McKenna's replaces that of Richard Ellmann. But ""A Great Unrecorded History"" is an important supplement to the established biographical work about Forster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205K12WTKF8OC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SRXGTK#wasThisHelpful","R205K12WTKF8OC","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Swing Time"" has the reputation of being Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' best musical, and it deserves that reputation for the dancing alone. For my money, the greatest dance duet ever recorded on film is Fred and Ginger dancing to ""Pick Yourself Up."" The sheer joy and abandon of their dance, coupled with their incredible timing and acrobatic physicality, ensure that this number has no equals. The Jerome Kern-Dorothy Fields score--including ""The Way You Look Tonight"" and ""A Fine Romance' as well as ""Pick Yourself Up""--also merits a stellar place among movie musical songwriting.Although I like Fred and Ginger as actors--and I also really like Victor Moore, Helen Broderick and Eric Blore--I find the story of ""Swing Time"" dull, much as I do the stories of very nearly every Astaire-Rogers movie. But that's OK, because with a DVD I can fast-forward to the singing and dancing. Fred and Ginger's song-and-dance numbers tell the story far more movingly than the actual screenplay. In any case, ""Swing Time"" is Fred and Ginger's masterpiece. Not to see it is not to know what Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were all about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IV65TRY3LOAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009NSCQM#wasThisHelpful","R1IV65TRY3LOAC","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some ways, Jacques Tati's ""Trafic"" might be considered a smaller-scale version of ""Playtime,"" his film from four years before. Whereas Tati tried to capture all of modern life in ""Playtime,"" in ""Trafic"" he concentrates on the world of transit--particularly the eccentric yet remarkably standardized behavior of people driving cars.In ""Trafic,"" his last full-length film, Tati once again plays M. Hulot, who this time is an automotive designer trying to transport his gadget-laden prototype camper from Paris to an auto show in Amsterdam. It gives nothing away to say that M. Hulot fails to get the camper to Amsterdam on time, because M. Hulot never succeeded at anything in any movie. As in all Tati movies, the journey is the point, as Hulot and his associates (including an imperious PR flack played by American supermodel Maria Kimberly) run into all sorts of weird people and situations, sometimes literally. The multi-vehicle pileup in the film's midsection, which plays like a collaboration between Rube Goldberg and Mack Sennett, is the film's centerpiece, though there are plenty of other standout gags.Unfortunately, there are also a lot of longueurs in ""Trafic"" in which nothing seems to happen, and other scenes in which nothing explicable happens. There was a always a slight nonsequitur quality to Tati's films, but in ""Trafic"" that tendency is pronounced. However, there are enough enjoyable gags to make ""Trafic"" worth seeing, as well as plenty of scenes that pay tribute to Tati's remarkable visual sense. The final scene, in which Hulot and Maria Kimberly try to flee the rain through a screen-filling gridlock of brightly colored cars, looks like what Mondrian would have come up with if he'd worked with cars instead of paints. It is as witty and pertinent a commentary on man and machine as has ever been put on screen. If Godard had had a sense of humor, he'd have been Tati.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19EBDYF9OE1VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00180R05O#wasThisHelpful","R19EBDYF9OE1VA","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"" is based on a simple but daring experiment. Linklater filmed his cast a couple of weeks every year over 12 years, creating a film in which the actors aged organically, without resorting to makeup or recasting the child actors. Ellar Coltrane, who plays the central role of Mason Evans Jr., begins the film as a boy of six, and ends it as a young man of 18.""Boyhood"" is the story of how Mason grows up in various towns in Texas with his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and sister (Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter). Sometimes Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke), Mason's father and Olivia's ex-husband, is also in the picture. The film doesn't have a plot in the conventional sense; it records the major events in Mason's life, which for the most part comprise a typical American boyhood. He rides his bike, plays video games, is forced to move away from his friends, makes new friends. He is bullied by schoolmates and two successive stepfathers, gets the usual spectacularly bad advice about women and sex from older boys, has his first love and his first breakup. Six-year-old Mason begins the move staring up the night sky from his front yard, and 18-year-old Mason ends it by staring up at the night sky, with his new college friends, in Big Bend National Park. In between, he's already made a major voyage through time, with the strong implication at the end that even more exciting adventures await him.I can see why some people might be disappointed in ""Boyhood."" The film doesn't offer any major plot twists or revelations, and a few critics have accused Linklater of dealing in cliches. In response, I would say that ""Boyhood"" is cliched only in the sense that life itself is cliched. Linklater tries to give us life as a boy lives it, and he succeeds. If some of the scenes seem a little clumsy or unfinished, isn't that the same with the events in our own lives? In any case. Linklater makes us care deeply about Mason, Olivia, Samantha and Mason Sr.; their triumphs are our triumphs, their sorrows are our sorrows. The scenes in which Mason is bullied or rejected are especially painful, because they echo so profoundly with the emotional hurts in our own lives.We come to love Mason, and it was Linklater's great luck that Ellar Coltrane is just as lovable as a gangly 18-year-old as he was as a cherubic six-year-old. He loses none of his charm with the passing years, and none of his ability to engage an audience. (Unfortunately, as we have all seen, that doesn't always happen with child actors.) Of course it doesn't hurt that Hawke and Arquette give the performances of their lives.One critic opined that ""Boyhood"" is about nothing and everything. I agree. It captures the flow of everyday life to a degree few films ever have, and it is unique in the way it records the growth and change from childhood to adulthood. Not even Michael Apted's ""7 Up"" movies managed what Linklater does here. Personally, I think ""Boyhood"" is a masterpiece. Certain immortal screen classics, such as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Vertigo,"" left their original audiences behind because they were so different from the movies of their time. ""Boyhood,"" I think, will be listed among their number.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1APNMSA1UVXIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEQUNIW#wasThisHelpful","R1APNMSA1UVXIW","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Lonely Planet San Francisco"" is very much in the same vein as Lonely Planet's other guidebooks. It contains thumbnail sketches of each San Francisco neighborhood, describing the flavor and vibe of each one, as well as detailed listings of the attractions in each neighborhood. Throughout there are breakout paragraphs on such hard-to-classify San Francisco features as Bob Kaufman Alley (named for a leading Beat poet) and the ""Sea Foraging "" adventures around San Francisco Bay, led by James Beard Award nominee Kirk Lombard. For those who want to explore outside the city, there are brief but adequate chapters on Berkeley, Marin County and the Wine Country. (The Wine Country section lists two of my favorite wineries--Frog's Leap in Napa County and Wellington in Sonoma County.) This is a generally useful guide, but some of the listings puzzled me (such as the semi-dismissive description of the American Conservatory Theater, one of the artistic glories of this country). I also wish some of the maps were stronger on giving street names.

"Christopher Conlon is a horror writer who specializes in the absolute extremes of human behavior. His particular genius is to uncover the aching core of humanity in even the most heinous monsters among us. ""Savaging the Dark,"" Conlon's latest novel, is his most daring, delicate balancing act to date. ""Savaging the Dark"" tells the story of Mona Straw, an outwardly normal, well-liked sixth-grade teacher whose life explodes when she falls in love with Connor Blue, one of her students. Taking cues from ""Psycho,"" ""Lolita,"" and the Mary Kay Letourneau scandal, Conlon ratchets up the suspense to unbearable levels as Mona descends into erotomania, madness and murder.Along the way, Conlon also has some bitter fun with the war between the sexes, as Connor--an otherwise innocent and likable boy--indulges in some behavior toward Mona that is all too common among adult men. Conlon's acuity about human nature has always been the touchstone of his work, backed up well by his skills in story structure and crafting exact, insinuating prose.""Savaging the Dark"" is brilliant, but so disturbing that it's not for everybody, perhaps not even for most readers. If you can get past the first chapter, you probably can make it through the rest of the book, though I make no blanket guarantees. Conlon provides a quiet, mournful epilogue to the book that gives readers as much closure as they could possibly expect from such a sad, disturbing story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38616TNO02XWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615936776#wasThisHelpful","R38616TNO02XWS","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Hare with Amber Eyes"" is not easily summarized, and all the better for it. It is at once a family history, an extended personal essay, a poetic consideration of a very particular art form, and a thoughtful, sometimes profound meditation on human nature. Author Edmund De Waal, an internationally renowned ceramicist, takes as his starting point the collection of 264 netsuke--tiny, exquisitely detailed Japanese sculptures, carved from wood or ivory--that he inherited from his beloved Uncle Iggie, Like Proust's madeleines, the netsuke lead De Waal into the history of his maternal ancestors, the Ephrussis, Russian-Jewish grain merchants and bankers who at one time rivaled the Rothschilds in wealth and influence.De Waal traces his Ephrussi ancestors from their origins in Odessa to their glory days in Paris and Vienna, and beyond to when World War II scattered the remaining family members across three continents. He introduces us to some fascinating characters: Charles-Joachim Ephrussi, Parisian esthete and collector, early champion of the Impressionists, who first collected the netsuke; Viktor and Emmy, heads of the Vienna branch of the Ephrussis, a horribly mismatched couple who received the netsuke as a wedding gift from Charles; Elisabeth, Viktor and Emmy's daughter and De Waal's grandmother, a brilliant lawyer and poet who fought fiercely on behalf of her family after the Nazis plundered their wealth; Iggie, the elegant bon vivant fated to return the netsuke to their country of origin and make his life there; and Anna, Emmy's maid, whose selfless act of loyalty toward the family made De Waal's book possible.""The Hare with Amber Eyes"" may be too leisurely for some tastes. but others will cherish it and reread it often.

"""The Escape Artist,"" written and produced by David Wolstencroft and directed by Brian Welsh, is another outstanding thriller from the PBS ""Masterpiece Mystery"" series. The story focuses on Will Burton (David Tennant), a brilliant but cocky London barrister who has never lost a case, even when his clients were obviously guilty. ""Everyone deserves a defense,"" Burton says, though the limits of his philosophy are tested when he has to defend Liam Foyle (Toby Kebbell), a particularly disgusting and depraved rapist-murderer. Burton gets Foyle off too, but receives a massive dose of his own medicine in consequence of his refusal to shake Foyle's hand after their victory.Some reviewers have revealed the plot here, but I will not, because you need to know as little about the plot twists and turns as possible going in. I will just say that the writing and direction are every bit as polished as we are accustomed to seeing from the BBC; that Tennant is wily and charismatic as Burton; that Toby Kebbell (who looks like a cross between Prince Andrew and Frankenstein's Monster) is a masterfully hateful Foyle; and Sophie Okonedo is simply smashing as a professional rival of Burton's.

"If you're looking for a happy, charming comedy full of delicious delights that require no sharp utensils for their consumption, look no further than Jon Favreau's ""Chef."" Favreau plays Carl Casper, a brilliant, driven chef whose family life fell apart because of his single-minded devotion to his art. Though a master of his craft, Carl is not master at the Los Angeles restaurant where he works; the owner (Dustin Hoffman) insists that Carl continue to make the dishes he created a decade ago, on pain of being fired. This leads to conflict with a snobbish restaurant critic (Oliver Platt) who accuses Carl of creative stagnation. Carl accidentally touches off a Twitter/YouTube war with the critic that leaves him professionally humiliated and out of a job. In a Hail Mary attempt to salvage his career, Carl flies back to his home town of Miami to start a food truck and drive cross-country with it. In the process, Carl also finds himself reconnecting with his ex-wife (Sofia Vergara) and small son (Emjay Anthony).""Chef"" isn't deep or profound in any way, but it is a breezy, consistently pleasant film that goes by far too quickly. Just as much as the characters and the dialogue, you will remember the profusion of mouth-watering food Favreau presents--Cubano sandwiches in Miami, beignets in New Orleans, barbecue in Austin. The movie's back-to-your-roots theme has led some critics to opine that Carl's story is symbolic of Favreau's own: after directing blockbusters such as ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and the first two Iron Man movies, Favreau is returning to the low-budget, character-driven comedies such as ""Swingers"" that first made his name. Perhaps that is so; I only know that ""Chef"" is a wonderful movie. Besides the aforementioned actors, such wonderful performers at Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale are also on hand, adding richness and flavor to the mix. ""Chef"" is a must-see--and make sure you've scoped out a good restaurant to go to after seeing it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CMFQU2UO6LPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQTHKQC#wasThisHelpful","R2CMFQU2UO6LPY","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No author has become so famous or beloved from one novel as Harper Lee. (Even Lee's fellow Southerner Margaret Mitchell can't match Lee: ""Gone with the Wind"" is becoming more and more of an historical artifact, whereas ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" grows stronger with each passing year.) Millions of readers hunger to know more about the small-town Alabama author who, throughout her long life, has shunned the limelight and refused either to be interviewed or to publish another novel. (""I'll talk to anybody,"" Lee once told a source. ""Just not for publication."")This changed in 2004, when Chicago Tribune reporter Marja Mills won the confidence of Lee (who has always been Nelle, never Harper, to her family and friends). With the blessing of Nelle and her attorney sister Alice (whom Nelle described as ""Atticus with a skirt""), Mills moved next door to the little house in Monroeville, Ala., shared by the Lee sisters. For the next eighteen months, she shared in the quiet pattern of their lives: fishing for catfish, feeding the ducks in the park, going for coffee or barbecue with friends, attending services at the Methodist church they've belonged to since childhood,  and reading, reading, reading. The result is Mills' new book, ""The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee.""Nelle and Alice agreed to talk to Mills largely to counter the lies and half-truths told about them and their family over the years, especially by Truman Capote and his equally mendacious aunts. (Of Capote and his family, Nelle said, ""They fled from the truth as Dracula from the cross."") Patiently, Mills filled notebook after notebook and tape after tape with material about the Lee family history. We learn of Nelle and Alice's father A.C. Lee, the model for Atticus, and the terrible tragedy of the unexpected deaths of their mother Frances and their brother Ed (the model for Jem) within a few weeks of each other.The structure of ""The Mockingbird Next Door"" is deceptively simple, and I was afraid it would end up telling us too much about Mills and not enough about Nelle and Alice. In the end, however, we get a clear portrait of quiet, steady Alice and the more mercurial Nelle, two women rooted so deeply in their Alabama hometown that they could not imagine a life outside of it. Nelle always spent a few months every year in her Manhattan apartment, but she always returned to Monroeville. Alice--suffering from an inner ear condition that made it impossible for her to fly--led a life of deep contentment in her hometown, surrounded by friends and her many books.This is a touching book, made even more so by the fact that Mills suffers from lupus and was gravely ill the entire time she researched and wrote it. She got to know Nelle and Alice none too soon: as the book closes, both sisters are forced to move to assisted living facilities. But we now have Mills' book. and fans of Harper Lee have every reason to be grateful for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3TK4CVLP94P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205191#wasThisHelpful","R1H3TK4CVLP94P","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Steven Knight's ""Locke,"" a man's entire life unravels during one ninety-minute drive down an English motorway, via a series of Bluetooth phone conversations with several people: his assistant, his boss, his sons, his wife, and another woman. To say any more would be to give too much away. You can justly call ""Locke"" a digital-age version of ""Sorry, Wrong Number,"" except that ""Locke"" is even more claustrophobic than the earlier film. Except for an opening shot at the massive construction site where Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is a supervisor, the entire film takes place behind the wheel of Locke's BMW. Thanks to Knight, Hardy and cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, it is a dazzling experience. We learn that Locke is a man who prides himself on being a problem-solver, the one who holds things together when everyone else is panicking. And we see what happens to him when life throws him a situation that even he can't solve.Above all, ""Locke"" is a triumph for Hardy, one of Britain's most impressive younger actors. Hardy has already won a substantial fan base through his supporting performances in such films as ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Here, he proves he can keep an audience riveted just sitting still in the driver's seat, using only his eyes and voice. We come to like Ivan Locke, for all his flaws, very much indeed, so that the fragile wand of hope that Fate holds out to him in the end feels completely earned. ""Locke"" is a must-see for adventurous filmgoers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GCY8PJMEDD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJ3EH6C#wasThisHelpful","R23GCY8PJMEDD1","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The three gigantic, CGI-created monsters are genuinely impressive, and the scenes of Tokyo, Honolulu, Las Vegas and especially San Francisco being laid waste create new standards for cinematic shock and awe. But the story is dull, the continuity terrible, and the actors superfluous. The filmmakers even advance the idea that we're supposed to admire Godzilla for destroying the other two monsters, never mind that Godzilla has killed just as many people and destroyed just as many buildings as the others.

"Some directors like to test the endurance of their audiences, and Richard Shepard, writer-director of ""Dom Hemingway,"" is one of them. The very first scene shows the title character (Jude Law) naked in prison, shouting a long, profane and boastful tribute to his favorite anatomical feature. Long and profane monologues, we soon discover, are typical of Dom Hemingway, who has all the macho bravado of his author namesake if not that author's laconic style.Dom has spent 12 years in prison for safecracking; he would have gotten out sooner, but he refused to squeal on his boss, the mysterious and sinister Ivan Fontaine (Demian Bichir), in expectation of a big payday when he gets out. The movie is the story of what happens to Dom when he's finally sprung. There are many twists and turns he doesn't quite anticipate, though nearly all of them are caused by his notable lack of impulse control. Besides Fontaine, the characters involved include Dickie Black (Richard E. Grant), Dom's dapper best friend; Paolina (Madalina Ghenea), Fontaine's gorgeous but mercenary mistress; Evelyn (Emilia Clarke), Dom's grown daughter, who wants nothing to do with him; and Lester (Jumayn Hunter), a gangster who has never forgiven Dom for killing his cat.In the end, ""Dom Hemingway"" is a lightweight film. But it's a wild and usually exhilarating ride, thanks to Law's go-for-broke performance and the scintillating scatological dialogue Shepard writes for him. The supporting cast is fine, but this is Law's show all the way, and it is a compliment to say he makes a spectacle of himself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ7R2EDJLY8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDEZPGG#wasThisHelpful","R1YZ7R2EDJLY8V","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Words work best when they are specifically chosen for the work you wish them to do,"" writes Orin Hargraves toward the end of his new book, ""It's Been Said Before: A Guide to the Use and Abuse of Cliches."" Cliches are unavoidable in spoken and most written language, Hargraves notes, and are often useful as verbal or linguistic shorthand to express a concept that otherwise might seem stilted or awkward. Too often, however, the cliche doesn't match the concept. This, Hargraves tells us, is because speakers and writers don't think about what they are trying to say.Using a corpus--which Hargraves defines as ""a collection of natural language in machine-readable form, assembled for the purpose of linguistic research""--Hargraves identifies some of the most commonly used cliches in English, ranks them on a scale of 1 to 5 for frequency of use, and considers what each cliche actually means. He breaks them down into several categories: Cliches That Name Things, Adjectival and Quantifying Cliches, Adverbial Cliches, Predicate Cliches, Framing Devices, Modifier Fatigue, and Cliches in Tandem. Conisidering each cliche, Hargraves offers several examples of its use and points out, wherever possible, when its use is actually appropriate. This is what he writes about the vastly overused ""by any means:"" ""This phrase is not a cliche in the tiny minority of cases in which it's used literally...It has an air of bluster and wordiness and many sentences in which it occurs read better without it.""Throughout the book, Hargraves stresses that he does not seek to make speakers and writers avoid cliches entirely, only to avoid them when they are inaccurate or vague. ""No writer can or should avoid cliches altogether, all the time--any more than a cook should strive to serve completely novel and unfamiliar dishes at every meal,"" he writes. But cliches, like all language, should do the job they're intended to do, and facilitate rather than hinder communication, he says. Speakers and writers who actually like to think about what they're saying, and who are interested in what words really mean and communicate, will find ""It's Been Said before"" an entertaining and enlightening read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IUB6RQD7V1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199315736#wasThisHelpful","R35IUB6RQD7V1I","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vincente Minnelli's ""Two Weeks in Another Town"" is pure cinematic cheese, but cheese of an exalted kind--sort of a cinematic double-cream Brie. Minnelli, screenwriter Charles Schnee and producer John Houseman (yes, THAT John Houseman) frame ""Two Weeks in Another Town"" as a followup, though not a sequel, to their previous Hollywood soap opera, ""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" which also starred Kirk Douglas. Here, Douglas plays a washed-up alcoholic actor who flies to Rome on the promise of two weeks of work from an old director frenemy (Edward G. Robinson). From there, Douglas is forced to deal with his much-hated, much-lusted-after ex-wife (Cyd Charisse), Robinson's drunken harpy wife (Claire Trevor), a self-pitying baby of a young leading man (George Hamilton), and many other viperish types. But there is still time for Douglas and Robinson to screen their previous big hit (""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" of course).""Two Weeks in Another Town"" is garish even by early-Sixties soap-opera standards, and wildly overacted in the bargain (especially by Trevor, Charisse and Hamilton). But Minnelli's direction is expert, and Schnee's runaway-freight-train style of storytelling keeps you watching, no matter how much you hate yourself for it. The film probably deserves a rating of between three-and-a-half and three-and-three-quarters stars out of five, and I don't mind bumping it up to four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0EDF6OZNORI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KO94K4#wasThisHelpful","RY0EDF6OZNORI","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Symphonic Dances"" were the last orchestral pieces Rachmaninov completed, and they are my favorites among all his works. They contain some of the most beautiful melodies he ever wrote, and the orchestrations are beyond magnificent. While Rachmaninov's Second Symphony is his most popular, I find the Third Symphony more cohesive and no less lovely than the earlier work. There are several excellent CDs that feature the Third Symphony and Symphonic Dances, but Slatkin and the Detroit Symphony give notably polished and forceful performances of these crowd-pleasing works.

"""The Gestapo: Power and Terror in the Third Reich"" is a scholarly but chilling book about the most infamous secret police force in the history of the world. Authors Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle meticulously set forth how the Gestapo and other Nazi security operations were formed from a combination of Nazi storm troopers and regular police; how Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich formed the structure of these operations and defined their purpose; and how the Third Reich unleashed these operations on Germany and the rest of Europe, leaving the continent awash in blood.Dams and Stolle make several telling points in their history of the Gestapo. First, far from being a flawlessly structured apparatus, the Gestapo was corrupt and amateurish; nevertheless, that was adequate for its agents to slaughter millions of people. Second, most former members of the Nazi secret police faded back into the regular police after the war, making it easy for them to protect themselves and their comrades from ever paying for their crimes. Third, the conditions that created the Gestapo have not vanished from the world. ""(T)he Gestapo was more than just a purely historical phenomenon,"" Dams and Stolle write at the end. ""It makes it very clear what people are capable of when state power gives them a mandate. If this power is corrupt or perverted, and based on the wrong values, then this leads to criminal acts. The individual agents are often not aware of any moral guilt, but are rather convinced that they are doing the right thing. The question of how such developments might be prevented in the future is relevant today.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FQIUQ4IP1SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019966921X#wasThisHelpful","R10FQIUQ4IP1SV","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" exceeds even ""Moonlight Kingdom"" as a dazzling good time at the movies, flamboyant both in story and in visual style. Anderson and co-screenwriter Hugo Guinness create a story within a story within a story, in which a beloved author (Tom Wilkinson) tells in old age of a meeting between his younger self (Jude Law) and the mysterious billionaire Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in Zero's crumbling but once-legendary hotel, the Grand Budapest. Zero takes the author back to 1932, when, as a young lobby boy (Tony Revolori), he worked at the Grand Budapest in its glory days under the tutelage of the greatest concierge in history, the magnificent Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes).""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a wonderfully Byzantine tragicomic story, stuffed with all sorts of hilarious double-crosses, clandestine meetings, dastardly conspiracies and general skullduggery. The central question is whether M. Gustave was responsible for the death of an ancient grande dame (Tilda Swinton), or whether the blame can be laid to her weaselly son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and his sinister henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Along the way are all sorts of colorful characters played by a Who's Who of star character actors including Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saiorse Ronan, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Mathieu Amalric and Jason Schwartzman. Most of them are on screen for only a few minutes, and some (Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban) have roles that can be measured in seconds. No matter. All of them add to the sparkling experience that is ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" The film is a magnificent visual experience, thanks to the cinematography of Robert D. Yeoman, the editing of Barney Pilling, the production design of Adam Stockhausen and the costumes of Milena Canonero. But it's the surreal verbal wit of Anderson and Guinness' screenplay that audiences will remember, such as this exchange already well-known through the film's trailer:M. GUSTAVE: She was dynamite in the sack.ZERO: She was eighty-four.M. GUSTAVE: I've had older.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a grand fairy tale, made deeper and richer by Anderson's knowledge that ""Happily Ever After"" is an illusion even in fairy tales.

"To read Katherine E. Young's ""Day of the Border Guards"" is to read the work of a poet who has an extraordinary grasp of both poetry and history--in Young's specific case, Russian poetry and history. Young is an impeccable scholar of both; her years living in Russia, both during and after Soviet hegemony, gave her acute insight into that country and empathy for its people. In poem after poem--""Siberian Spring,"" ""Centralized Heating,"" ""The Arrest: May 13, 1934""--Young demonstrates an unerring eye, a sympathetic heart and a lapidary ability to shape a poetic phrase. Great names of Russian poetry are invoked in these pages--Pushkin, Mandelstam, Akhmatova, Lermontov--and Young's work bears comparison with theirs. The breathtaking power and superb craftsmanship of her poems are revealed in such lines as these that end ""Zagorsk,"" the penultimate poem in the book:Perhaps only one who's struck downhis own son can take the measureof this land; perhaps the land hews menin its image--ax, knout, flail--each wounda beginning, each beginning a wound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZ016URQVHIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557286558#wasThisHelpful","R2AZ016URQVHIR","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no surprise that Wendell Berry dedicated ""Leavings,"" this beautiful and limpid book of poems, to his close friend, the late John Haines. Haines had many traits in common with Berry: an ornery individualism, an annoyance with poetic fads, a deep-seated distrust of commercialized agriculture (and commercialization in general), and a profound connection with the earth and everything that comes from it.""Leavings,"" like the rest of Berry's body of work, is a book for intelligent readers who are attracted to poetry but alienated by contemporary poets who see their art as the exclusive province of the college classroom. It is also, emphatically, a book for anyone who feels, as Wordsworth said, that ""the world is too much with us."" The book jacket quotes the New York Times Book Review about Berry's ""Wordsworthian clarity of purpose,"" and indeed--particularly in the poems Berry calls ""Sabbaths"" that comprise the bulk of this book--Berry demonstrates a connection with Nature comparable with that of the most ardent Romantic poets. It's hard to see how any modern poet could get more Wordsworthian than Berry does in Poem XVI from the 2005 ""Sabbaths:""I hear the sound of wings.What man can abide the ruleof ""the market"" when he hears,in his waking, in his sleep,the sound of wings?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJYQUG4EEHSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158243624X#wasThisHelpful","R1UJYQUG4EEHSE","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Eternal Nazi,"" the new nonfiction book by veteran reporters Nicholas Kulish and Souad Mekennet, tells a dramatic story: the decades-long manhunt for SS doctor Aribert Heim. Heim served only a few months at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, but it was long enough for him to kill hundreds of prisoners, some by injecting gasoline straight into their hearts, others by removing vital, still-healthy organs. Heim kept the skulls of some of his victims as trophies. And he did it all, apparently, not under orders, but strictly for his own amusement.Unfortunately, Kulish and Mekhennet only tell the story; they do not bring it to life. ""The Eternal Nazi"" has much to say about why the hunt for so many Nazis ended in disappointment: the proliferation of false leads, the meddling of the United States and other governments that used former Nazis as spies, the active hostility of unpunished former Nazis in high places, and--above all--the simple inertia created by war-weariness. Yet Kulish and Mekhennet, diligent as they are in their reporting, never bring any real excitement to the story. It's all there, all meticulously detailed, all second- and third-hand.It probably was inevitable that Heim could not be brought fully to life. Kulish and Mekhennet present witnesses to his long postwar life in Cairo, living under his new Muslim name. But, aside from the long screeds he wrote justifying his actions, Heim never speaks for himself. This of course is to be expected of a man who lived most of his life in hiding. But Alfred Aedtner, the Wehrmacht soldier-turned-Nazi hunter who devoted his life to chasing Heim, also remains a semi-cipher. So does Waltraut Boser, Heim's illegitimate daughter, who lived her life in her father's shadow even though she never met him. Only Rudiger Heim, Heim's conflicted younger son, comes anywhere close to seeming three-dimensional.Toward the end of ""The Eternal Nazi,"" Kulish and Mekhennet quote Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff, who said that Nazi hunting ""consisted of meticulous, detailed research...Yet it is precisely this very prosaic and often monotonous work which yields positive and, at times, spectacular results."" This is indeed true, and Zuroff and his colleagues deserve all the honor the world can give for their dedication in tracking down monsters. If only Kulish and Mekhennet had been better able to relieve the monotony of their book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVEQNCQR14BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532431#wasThisHelpful","R3JVEQNCQR14BQ","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of Bart Layton's ""The Imposter"" tells us up front: the young man with a French accent who turns up at a Spanish juvenile shelter in 1997 is not Nicholas Barclay, a 13=year-old boy who disappeared from his home town of San Antonio, Texas, three years before. It is the full measure of the skill of Layton and his filmmaking team that this knowledge spoils nothing of what is to come.Questions remain, of course: Who is this young man, really? Why did Nicholas' family welcome him with open arms when he was so obviously not Nicholas? And--most compelling of all--what really happened to Nicholas? We get a definite answer to the first question, and a partial answer to the second. As for the third...""The Imposter"" is a marvel of pacing, photography and editing, combining interviews, home movies and archival news footage with re-enactments by actors who are remarkable body doubles for the actual people. The twists and turns of the story, and the real-life characters in it, are so compelling that they seem like something Raymond Chandler, Elmore Leonard and Alfred Hitchcock would have spent their first thousand years in the afterlife dreaming up.

"I've seen most of the Dardenne Brothers' movies by now--""The Son,"" ""The Child,"" ""The Kid with a Bike""--but ""La Promesse"" is my favorite of a very distinguished group of films. The Dardennes have staked out a very particular cinematic territory--the lives of criminals, bums and down-and-outers in the dreary industrial town of Liege, Belgium. From that they have created a distinctive, pure, intense cinematic style, in which their characters are presented with the starkest, most painful moral choices possible. It's Greek tragedy, as funneled through Vittorio de Sica and Robert Bresson.""La Promesse"" stars two of the Dardennes' regular actors, Olivier Gourmet and Jeremie Renier. Igor (Renier) is a 15-year-old delinquent who helps his father Roger (Gourmet) exploit African and Eastern European immigrants for profit. When one of their workers dies in an accident, Roger tries to cover it up, but Igor finds himself feeling concern for the dead man's widow and baby. Igor's budding conscience leads him to an agonizing point of no return.""La Promesse"" follows the usual pattern of the Dardennes' films: a plain, starkly realistic setting, shot mostly in claustrophobic closeup, with extreme situations and emotions leading to an ending in which no closure or resolution is possible. The actors could not be better; Gourmet is particularly fine as a despicable monster who has convinced himself he is only doing what he must to support his family. Simple and powerful, ""La Promesse"" will leave you with a heartache that will last for days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39PIH6NQ9TY7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083V2W18#wasThisHelpful","R39PIH6NQ9TY7D","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nearly three decades after the final revised edition appeared, Vito Russo's ""The Celluloid Closet"" is still an impressive achievement and a compulsive read. Russo's enterprise and scholarship are still impressive, as is his sense of mission and his anger--sometimes barely contained--at the blatant, often bloody homophobia that persisted in cinema from its earliest beginnings through the 1980s.Russo presents a panoramic view of homosexuality in the movies over nearly a century, beginning with an Edison experimental film of two men dancing a waltz and ending with gay-themed films that appeared toward the end of his tragically brief life. Some of these later films, such as ""Parting Glances"" with Steve Buscemi, represented a tremendous advance in the portrayal of gays on screen. Others, such as ""Cruising"" with Al Pacino, were so disgustingly violent and negative that they triggered street protests. In between, Russo presents some fascinating stories about early gay-themed movies, such as ""Anders als die Anderen"" (Different from the Others), a 1919 German silent starring Conrad Veidt as a gay concert violinist who responds to blackmail by committing suicide. The Nazis destroyed every copy of ""Anders als die Anderen"" they could find (in one case, Russo reports, opening fire on theater patrons in Vienna); only one partial copy, found in Ukraine, survives today.Though some crirics have complained that Russo ignored social theory in his analysis, or that he failed to consider important gay directors such as Eisenstein and Fassbinder, ""The Celluloid Closet"" is still a fascinating and informative book. It's too bad no one has taken up Russo's torch. There have been articles and books about LGBT cinema since Russo's death in 1990, but nothing as magisterial as ""The Celluloid Closet."" I think Russo would be encouraged by the progress gays and lesbians have made in the cinema since his passing, and it would be nice if another Russo arose to record and assess that progress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A6RPAZYDTIJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060961325#wasThisHelpful","R1A6RPAZYDTIJA","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sorrow and pain of romantic obsession are front and center in ""The Invisible Woman,"" Ralph Fiennes' opulently somber drama about a little-known chapter of the life of Charles Dickens. Based on the biography by Claire Tomalin, ""The Invisible Woman"" is the story of the middle-aged Dickens (Fiennes), by then the most famous and beloved novelist in the world, becoming obsessed with Nelly Ternan (Felicity Jones), a teenage actress in a play Dickens directs and stars in. Dickens presses his suit to Nelly, who at first is unsure of her feelings for Dickens, despite her enormous admiration for him as a writer. Dickens, meanwhile, begins acting like a madman in his passion for Nelly, deserting his wife and ordering his family and friends to accept Nelly or else.The combination of Victorian hypocrisy and illicit love hangs over the movie like a fog, so that it is a singularly claustrophobic viewing experience. However, the excellence of the performances--Fiennes, Jones, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Nelly's mother--makes the film worthwhile, as do the beautiful costumes and sets. In the end, ""The Invisible Woman"" is the story of a powerful man driven to remake the world around him in his image, and of a young woman left in the end to find a life and identity for herself. it is a rich, complex, and--yes--novelistic story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UDGGY1Y68UM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBIIQTU#wasThisHelpful","R1UDGGY1Y68UM7","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" has received a lot of hostile reviews, which I think is totally unfair. It may not be the most exciting or cohesive World War II film ever made, but it is intelligent, superbly acted, and deeply moving in all the appropriate places.Clooney heads the cast as Frank Stokes, an art historian who leads the effort to find paintings and sculptures stolen by the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The art experts he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, and Bob Balaban; also in the cast is Cate Blanchett as a Parisian museum curator who provides Damon with invaluable aid at a crucial moment. None of these actors has a particularly large or colorful part, but individually and together they give ""The Monuments Men"" an impressive sheen of professionalism. Murray, Goodman, and Balaban are particularly enjoyable, all providing wry comic relief.""The Monuments Men"" is necessarily an episodic story as the art experts split up to track different artistic treasures. Cumulatively, however, it is a moving story celebrating the achievements of civilization and the need to protect them from monsters. Some critics objected to Clooney stating those goals outright through the character of Stokes; frankly, I was cheering him.

"""Walking is dull, repetitive and monotonous. That is all too true. But for that reason it is never tiresome."" Thus writes Frederic Gros, a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris, in his slim but erudite new book, ""A Philosophy of Walking."" Gros discusses the various types and purposes of walking--the country ramble, the urban stroll, the pilgrimage, the protest march. Different chapters offer capsule biographies of famous walkers and describe the significance walking had for each. Their reasons for walking, Gros shows us, were as different as their reasons for being. ""Thoreau walked...not to find himself, but always to be in a position to reinvent himself,"" Gros says of the author of ""Walden."" Gandhi, on the other hand, made his pilgrimages ""opposing the world's violence with the peace of a slow, humble, unending walk.""Throughout the book, Gros expounds his own, extremely convincing philosophy of walking as a way to clear one's mind, to see things new, to perceive the world and one's place in it more clearly.

"To see ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" is to witness truly awe-inspiring exhibitions of cinematic ineptitude. And to see the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" version of ""Manos"" is to see the absolute high point of the comedic art of Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Michael J. Nelson et.al. ""Manos"" had languished in obscurity for more than a quarter-century until the MST3K gang plucked it from a pile of Z-grade sci-fi and horror films to feature on the show. To quote ""The Producers,"" it was magic time.This two-disc DVD from Shout Factory contains both the original and MST3K versions of ""Manos"" (all the better to demonstrate the enormous superiority of the latter) as well as plenty of extras totaling more than four-and-a-half hours altogether. Among the extras is ""Hotel Torgo,"" a documentary about the making of ""Manos."" (The documentary, alas, is pretty thin, relying mostly on the reminiscences of Bernie Rosenblum, the only living cast member of ""Manos"" who could be located.) There is also ""Group Therapy,"" a discussion between Hodgson, Beaulieu, Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl about how they selected ""Manos"" for the show and the extreme agonies they suffered in watching it over and over again to write appropriate one-liners for it. (This discussion is a bit of a ""Manos"" moment itself: Beaulieu and Conniff's voices are ear-blasting, Hodgson's and Pehl's barely audible.) .In any case, if you can buy only one ""MST3K"" DVD, ""Manos"" is definitely the one to buy,","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEHPLPCU09AK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055CP9UY#wasThisHelpful","R2VEHPLPCU09AK","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Paul Stephenson may have claimed the title of ""Best Worst Movie"" for ""Troll 2,"" but James Nguyen's ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" is just as strong a contender for that award. The bird attacks in the second half of ""Birdemic"" have no equals for sheer ludicrousness. Unfortunately, for the entire first half of this ninety-minute movie, you are forced to endure the interminable courtship of Rod and Nathalie, the dullest couple in the history of the movies, played by Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, two of the dullest (and most inept) actors in cinematic history. But the very dullness of the first half has its own fascination, especially for connoisseurs of cinematic cheese.I think the title of ""Best Worst Movie"" should be decided by a three-way Xtreme Boxing cage match between Nguyen, ""Troll 2"" director Claudio Fragasso and ""The Room"" director Tommy Wiseau. The one who walks away gets to claim the title forever. (Unfortunately, the other two contenders--Edward D. Wood Jr. for ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and Hal P.

"Gerald Finzi (1901-56) may be Britain's most underrated composer. World War II began just as Finzi was ready to start his international career, and his early death from Hodgkin's Disease robbed England of one of its greatest musical talents. This centenary collection of Finzi's music, released in 2001 by William Boughton and the English String Orchestra, is an excellent introduction to Finzi. The CD contains some of his best-known music, including the Clarinet Concerto, the Eclogue for piano and strings, and the incidental music for Shakespeare's ""Love's Labours Lost."" Finzi's music is imbued with the spirit of English folksong--much like the music of his friend and mentor, Ralph Vaughan Williams--but also has a gentle, refined lyricism that reminds me of Gabriel Faure. The performances on this disc are exquisite, without exception.

"Orlando Ricardo Menes' introduction to Dan Vera's ""Speaking Wiri Wiri"" does such an excellent job of delineating the poet's purposes and esthetics that it leaves reviewers little room to add anything fresh. But I will try. As a Cuban-American raised in the heavily Mexican precincts of South Texas, Vera has an unusually panoramic view of the Latino experience in America, as well as a wry appreciation of the cultural clashes, mostly linguistic, that occur between different national groups. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the first section of ""Speaking Wiri Wiri,"" titled ""The Trouble with Language."" and particularly in the poem titled ""Tower of Babel."" In that poem, Vera's Cuban father is in a Dallas restaurant, seeking ""menudo"" (change) for a five-dollar bill. Unfortunately, ""menudo"" in Mexican Spanish means ""tripe soup."" This leads to a crazy argument between Vera's father and the restaurateur that richly illustrates Vera's appreciation of the human comedy. The poem also stands as an implicit rebuke to those who see Latino culture as monolithic. Cuba and Mexico, after all, are no more alike than Maine and Montana.Throughout ""Speaking Wiri Wiri,"" Vera shows himself to be a poet of plain language, but capable of turns of phrase that take our breath away. (In the poem ""Caduco,"" when Vera's mother remarks that most of the pictures in his photo album are of his dog, he says, ""I laughed and thought/this is what happens/when the tail grabs the heart."") The subjects of the poems range widely, from a visit by Nabokov to the Smithsonian to Cesar Romero playing the Joker on the ""Batman"" TV series, but Vera always returns to subjects of family and identity. In ""Commemorations of Forgotten History,"" Vera's family makes a pilgrimage to the Catskills town where Jose Marti lived for a time, only to find is no monument, plaque or even local knowledge of the great Cuban poet. ""Asombrado"" tells of the 2009 March on Washington for Immigration Reform. (""They march past the office buildings/of the government that can not see them/that considers them a menace and urban legend."") In ""I Know You Little Codfish,"" Vera commemorates ""the phrases of our fathers"" that contain a wealth of both heritage and wisdom: ""They reveal memory to be the master/of a treasure more profound/than any English we may have mastered."") ""Speaking Wiri Wiri"" is a delightful and important book of poetry by a humane, thoughtful, and masterful young writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7COTWSUTULQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597092746#wasThisHelpful","R1P7COTWSUTULQ","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andy Milligan's films are uniquely terrible, in a way that Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films never began to approach. Whereas Wood never had an idea in his head except his dream of being a director, Milligan had twisted, convoluted ideas that made Pasolini look like Walt Disney. Warped by his profoundly bitter experiences with his abusive mother, and further deranged by his drug-addled Bohemian New York milieu, Milligan strove to make important films denouncing the corruption of society. Unfortunately, he had neither the budgets nor the patience to make anything good. What he did have was a ""genius"" for horror stories every bit as loopy as Wood's, as well as a pronounced taste for sadism. Add to that his ugly camerawork, inaudible sound, and performances that ranged between the hammy and the catatonic, and you have films that could appeal only to the most hardcore aficionados of cinematic cheese.""Guru, the Mad Monk"" tells the story of the title character, a schizophrenic 15th-century priest whose bloody misrule turns the island of Mortavia into a living hell. Neil Flanagan, a Milligan regular, is terrible as Father Guru, though not as bad as Jaqueline Wood as Olga, Guru's vampire mistress, or Paul Lieber as Carl, an innocent forced to do Guru's bidding. (After seeing Lieber's flat, disengaged performance, it is amazing to learn that he actually went on to a long and reasonably successful career, mostly in live theater and TV.) The best thing you can say about ""Guru, the Mad Monk"" is that it's short--only 57 minutes. The print quality, as other reviewers have noted, is abysmal. However, this DVD includes a fascinating interview with Tom Vozza, a still photographer who worked with Milligan on his last two films. As Vozza notes, he is one of the few living people who can discuss Milligan's working methods, most of his other cast and crew members having OD'ed long ago.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPKR9ZSLO64E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063K12#wasThisHelpful","RHPKR9ZSLO64E","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the late piano pieces of Brahms--particularly the six pieces of Op. 118--and this Philips two-disc compilation of those works is an excellent bargain. Most of the music on the two discs--Op. 116 through 119 and the Handel Variations--are played by the well-known Stephen Kovacevich, who brings both power and poetry to his performances of these works. The remainder of the music is performed by two lesser-known pianists, Dinorah Varsi and Adam Harasiewicz, who are also very good. My feeling is that unless you are an ardent advocate of a specific pianist or pianists in this repertoire, you should be well satisfied with these recordings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6PJ1WU8ZRCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041AH#wasThisHelpful","R1B6PJ1WU8ZRCH","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ben Tarnoff's ""The Bohemians"" is a fascinating and highly readable book covering an important chapter of American literary history: the ""Bohemian"" movement in San Francisco in the 1860s, and the four most important authors to arise from it. Of course the most important of the four was Mark Twain, and Twain's meteoric rise after years of uncertainty and poverty is the chief engine of Tarnoff's story. But Tarnoff also has compelling tales to tell of Twain's fellow Bohemians: Bret Harte, dapper and sardonic, initial star and mentor of the group until alcoholism and writer's block put an end to his literary career; Ina Coolbrith, eventually Poet Laureate of California, who fought bravely against poverty and family tragedy; and Charles Warren Stoddard, a kindhearted, impractical dreamer at war with society and his own sexuality.Tarnoff paints a vivid picture of the young San Francisco, rough and violent, yet hungry for the printed word and eager to establish itself as a distinctive society, free from the imitation (and judgment) of European and New England models. At 256 pages (minus index, notes and acknowledgments), ""The Bohemians"" provides only brief portraits of its subjects, but they are sharp and memorable portraits. The saddest pages are at the end, portraying the explosive collapse of Twain and Harte's friendship. (Tarnoff tells us that Twain had every reason to be furious at Harte, but Twain's actions against his former friend were inexcusable.) Just as sad was the co-opting of the Bohemian literary movement by wealthy businessmen who transformed it into the Bohemian Club, the infamous haven for right-wing politicos. The emblematic story here is the fate of Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian minister and abolitionist who served as mentor to all four of the original Bohemians. In 1931, the California legislature chose to honor King with a statue in the U.S. Capitol. In 1989, King's statue was replaced with a statue of Ronald Reagan. The California congressman who sponsored the change said he had no idea who King even was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV59GNFY56JEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420473X#wasThisHelpful","RV59GNFY56JEC","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio grab the audience by the scruff of the neck and shake it like a rottweiler shaking a kitten. When I saw the film, a lot of people walked out in the first hour, and I understood why: the endless, high-speed parade of dishonesty, drugs and depravity is VERY hard to take. But those of us who stuck out the film for its nearly three-hour running time were rewarded with the most brilliant, corrosive indictment ever of Wall Street scam artists. Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) made Bernie Madoff look like Santa Claus, and Scorsese spares us no detail of the fathomless greed of Belfort and his cronies at the bogus trading firm of Stratton Oakmont.Scorsese is obviously fascinated by these swine, as he was by the mobsters of ""Goodfellas."" But being fascinated by them and admiring them are two different things. Belfort, his right-hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), and their associates are devilishly fun  to watch with their charm and chutzpah, but they are not likable or admirable for one second, and they are not meant to be. Scorsese, DiCaprio, Hill and the others let these self-aggrandizing jerks hang themselves with their own designer ties. The cast members seem to be having a blast making these characters as outrageously hateful as they possibly can, and the performances are extraordinary straight down the line. The best-acted scene I've seen this year comes in the middle of ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" between a smug Belfort and a canny FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who is a lot smarter than Belfort--who measures a person's intelligence by the size of his bank account--gives him credit for.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a magnificently orchestrated train wreck of avarice, lust, and wasted lives. The muted, equivocal ending is far more disturbing than a standard-issue movie comeuppance would have been, and suggests strongly that the financial wreckage created by Belfort will continue and multiply, long past the foreseeable future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17LDH4D0YVBDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9KKKAY#wasThisHelpful","R17LDH4D0YVBDS","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't understand some of the reviews for Alexander Payne's ""Nebraska."" Gritty and unsentimental the film certainly is, but the assertion that it's crueler than anything by the Coen Brothers is nonsensical to me. Payne's direction and Bob Nelson's screenplay reveal successive layers of both brutality and poignancy in the story of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) an old man in Billings, Montana, who clings stubbornly to the idea that he has won $1 million in the Publishers' Clearinghouse sweepstakes. David (Will Forte), Woody's hapless son, offers to drive him to Lincoln, Nebraska, just to prove to him he didn't win a cent. But Woody's sudden illness waylays father and son in Woody's home town of Hawthorne, Nebraska, where Woody's family members and old friends take Woody's claims of sudden wealth at face value.""Nebraska"" is a masterpiece of wry humor, and has a keen eye for the tensions that build up within families. Exemplifying those tensions is Kate (June Squibb), Woody's wife, who expresses her disappointments in no uncertain (or chaste) terms. There's also a lot of meanness in the film, exemplified by Woody's old crony Ed Peagram (Stacy Keach) and David's weirdo cousins Bart and Cole (Tim Driscoll, Devin Rattray). But the final emotion we feel in ""Nebraska"" is love, as Woody expresses things he never said before and David learns things he never knew before. It is that tenderness at ""Nebraska's"" core that makes it a transcendent experience. Phedon Papamichael's photography of the Great Plains is as starkly beautiful as anything in ""The Last Picture Show,"" and the acting--particularly that of Dern, Forte, and Squibb--could not possibly be finer, funnier, or more nuanced. ""Nebraska"" is one of the finest films of 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5ZSPSKITXCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9L26AA#wasThisHelpful","R3R5ZSPSKITXCM","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of ""Blue Car"" until first a close friend, and then my sister, strongly recommended it to me. I have now seen the film, and they are right: it is a powerful, moving film that deserves to be far better known than it is. My heart ached for Meg (Agnes Bruckner) and her mother (Margaret Colin), who end up at each other's throats largely because they have to deal with far more tragedy than anyone should ever have to face. And while I was glad at first for Meg to have Mr. Auster (David Strathairn) in her life, I also wondered where their relationship would end up, and suspected it could not possibly be anywhere good.While the film occasionally verges on the melodramatic, the clear direction and excellent writing of Karen Moncrieff keep it from going over the top, and the acting is extraordinary. Agnes Bruckner should have become a star from her performance as Meg; I suspect the problems Miramax was having at the time prevented this movie from reaching the audience it should have. But take a chance on it now; I suspect it will move you deeply. The disc includes more than a dozen deleted scenes, including one fairly important character who ended up on the cutting room floor. While Moncrieff was probably correct to cut them from the finished movie, they make excellent viewing on their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UQCRDIIPMQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000ARD7R#wasThisHelpful","R8UQCRDIIPMQY","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few great films that make all other movies, no matter how wonderful, seem frivolous by comparison. Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" is one of those. The true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man in upstate New York in 1841 who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, the film shows the total horror and degradation of living as a slave, as well as the total corruption of slave traders and masters.Chiwetel Ejiofor is quietly, burningly powerful as Northup, a man torn from his happy family life to face years of torture and brutalization. You could call his experience a Hitchcockian nightmare, except that the phrase trivializes the absolute horror of his situation. Yet as hideous as Northup's situation is, it is relatively comfortable compared with the fate of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a woman enslaved by plantation owners Edwin and Martha Epps (Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson). The epitome of crazed corruption, Edwin likes to pretend that Patsy is his mistress by choice, and Martha likes to pretend that Patsey is her rival. Both are too twisted to recognize the truth: that Patsey is a helpless pawn driven to the brink of suicide by the unspeakable sadism of her master and mistress.The very title gives away that Northup's servitude comes to an end. Yet even when it does, there is no feeling of closure; he lost 12 years of his life for no reason, and Patsey and the other slaves live on in agony. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a movie that lingers powerfully in the memory, and stands as a rebuke to films that made the plantation system look benign (""Gone with the Wind"") or turned it into an action-revenge-movie joke (""Django Unchained""). It is the best film of the year, and one of the best of the decade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NOUNAFJEI9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4Q3KOC#wasThisHelpful","R14NOUNAFJEI9A","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are two DVD versions of Stephen Sondheim's ""Company,"" both directed by Lonny Price. The first, dating from 2007, is a version of John Doyle's theater-in-the-round Broadway revival, starring Raul Esparza and featuring performers playing musical instruments as well as singing and dancing. The second is the one for sale on this page--the 2011 semi-concert version at Lincoln Center, featuring the New York Philharmonic and an all-star cast including Neil Patrick Harris, Patti LuPone, Stephen Colbert and Christina Hendricks.Which one to buy? Frankly, they're both great. I would say the Price-Esparza version is more serious and austere, the Price-Harris version more slapsticky and show-bizzy. That's not to say Price-Esparza isn't laugh-out-loud funny at times (its version of ""Not Getting Married Today"" is peerless) or that Price-Harris doesn't do justice to the story's serious moments. Both versions do full justice to Sondheim's magnificent songs and George Furth's cynical-poignant book.At this point, I prefer this version, though I might change my mind later. Stephen Colbert's slapstick-karate act with Harris and Martha Plimpton alone is worth the price of this disk, as are LuPone's superb versions of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" and ""Perfect Relationships.""

"This is the first edition of ""Best American Essays"" that I have read, and I expected at least a few literary or political essays. As edited by Cheryl Strayed, however, the essays in the 2013 edition are uniformly, heavily personal. The only partial exceptions are Zadie Smith's ""Some Notes on Attunement,"" which begins with Smith's youthful distaste for the music of Joni Mitchell and continues into a consideration of Kierkegaard, and John Jeremiah Sullivan's ""Ghost Estates,"" in which Sullivan concludes that only J.M. Synge of all Irish writers could capture the Irish people in the perilous situation they face today. Otherwise, the accent throughout this volume is strictly on pesonal reminiscence, and mostly on personal tragedy.Although I'm not sure how Zadie Smith and Alice Munro qualify as American essayists, all of the essays in the 2013 Best American Essays are praiseworthy. As excellent as they are, however, I advise reading only one or two at a time; reading the book straight through may terminally depress you. We have Charles Baxter's essay about surviving a horrific car crash, Poe Ballantine's about living in poverty under the thumb of a tyrannical landlady, Vanessa Veselka's about how she almost became the victim of a serial killer, Eileen Pollack's abut the sad life and horrible death of the boy who was her first crush in school. Several essays in the book concentrate on motherhood. Marcia Aldrich's ""The Art of Being Born,"" written as a letter to her newborn child, ends happily despite its depiction of Aldrich's childhood sorrows. Yet there is also Megan Stielstra's ""Channel B,"" about her struggles with post-partum depression, and Michelle Mirsky's heartbreaking ""Epilogue: Deadkidistan,"" depicting her grief over the death of her five-year-old son from leukemia.While it's difficult to choose a favorite among so many fine essays, the two that moved me most were Angela Morales' ""The Girls in My Town"" and Jon Kerstetter's ""Triage."" Morales' calm, matter-of-fact tone just barely conceals her rage and grief over the dead-end lives of the teenage girls she teaches in her central California farming town, trapped in early pregnancies and poverty before they even understand they have choices in life. Kerstetter, a retired Army surgeon, writes of the necessity of dividing combat casualties into those who can be saved and those who can't. To read of Kerstetter's vigil over the bed of a dying soldier gives new and tragic meaning to the phrase, ""supporting our troops.""If you're seeking happy reading, this volume of essays is not for you. But if you seek excellent, moving writing by a group of wise, compassionate, and superbly skilled authors, this book is a must-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRVDABQHZYG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544103882#wasThisHelpful","R2WRVDABQHZYG5","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The identity of ""The Dark Lady"" and ""Mr. W.H."" in Shakespeare's sonnets has been a mystery for centuries. Any number of writers (most famously Oscar Wilde) have presented their own theories and conjectures. In ""A Waste of Shame,"" directed by John McKay, screenwriter/novelist William Boyd (A Good Man in Africa, Any Human Heart) presents his own poignant, intriguing answer to the mystery.As ""Mr. W.H.,"" Boyd selects one of the more usual suspects--William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. For ""The Dark Lady,"" he creates a French-Moorish courtesan, Lucie. Revealing the identity of Shakespeare's objects of desire, however, is not Boyd's purpose in writing ""A Waste of Shame."" He is far more interested in Shakespeare the man, and how these lost loves affected his life and his work. Boyd's Shakespeare isn't always admirable; when his shrewish wife Anne calls him a ""whoremonger,"" she's not far wrong. But this Shakespeare obviously is a man of deep, conflicted feelings and burning passions--a man who believably could have written those sonnets and those plays.""A Waste of Shame"" provides a rare starring role for the much underrated actor Rupert Graves, who with seeming effortlessness persuades us completely of Shakespeare's genius. Also admirable are Indira Varma as Lucie, Tom Sturridge as Will Herbert, Anna Chancellor as Anne, Nicky Henson as Shakespeare's father, Andrew Tiernan as Ben Jonson, Nicholas Rowe as Richard Burbage, Zoe Wanamaker as Herbert's mother, and a very young Tom Hiddleston as Shakespeare's doctor. I wish Boyd had filled in a few more of the blanks in his portrait of Shakespeare--this is one of the very few movies I have wished to be longer--but his presentation of early-17th-century London is persuasive, and the dialogue sounds authentic to the period without leaving modern audiences behind.

"""Take Heart: Poems from Maine"" is an anthology of Maine poets, edited by Maine Poet Laureate Wesley McNair and published by Down East Books. It provides a fine historical perspective of poets who were born or lived in Maine, from great classic names (Longfellow, Millay, Robinson) to poets of the more recent past (May Sarton, Philip Booth, Louise Bogan, Elizabeth Coatsworth), to poets living and working today (Bruce Guernsey, Richard Foerster, Tom Sexton, Lewis Turco, Betsy Sholl). All of the poems here are at least good, and most are better than good.My early favorite in the book is Sarton's ""The Geese,"" its finely chiseled stanzas adding immeasurably to its poignancy (""Some woman every year/Must catch her breath and weep/With so much wildness near/At all she cannot keep.""). But there is much to admire and cherish here, such as Guernsey's poignant sonnet ""Night Patrol"" and Booth's short, sharp ""United States."" McNair, an excellent poet himself, forbore from including any of his own poems--a becoming bit of modesty, though I would have liked to have seen a poem or two from him. ""Take Heart"" contains the kind of poetry I like--accessible at first reading, yet still leaving a great deal in reserve for the sixth, seventh and eighth readings. This is the sort of poetry anthology that could persuade intelligent general readers that they really do like poetry, after all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FRWSS98M2A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608932222#wasThisHelpful","R14FRWSS98M2A7","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kathi Wolfe's ""The Green Light"" is one of those little books of poetry that contains multitudes of wit, poignancy and insight. In just 26 pages, Wolfe tells the story of a mid-20th-century American family: father Stan, mother Rita, daughter Kate, son Josh. Even Sparky the Dog gets a poem. The poem ""Cheesesteak at Pat's"" tells vividly of the bigotry faced by couples of that time who married outside their faiths:Love and marriage go together like a horse and carriagebut not for a Jew and gentile, everyone said,your children would be mongrels. What would Godwant with them?Other poems deal with Rita's diabetes, at a time when medical treatments for the disease were much less effective than they are now. In ""The Twist,"" Rita is on the dance floor, imagining she ""grinds her diabetes/to a pulp/just like she did last summer,/and bumps death/right/off/the Billboard charts."" As for Kate, who is born blind, she expresses her rebellion in ""Blind Ambition:"" ""I don't want to be/any Goody-Two-Shoes Helen./I want to baptize/my new sneakers/in the mud.""Richly detailed and deeply humane, Wolfe's poems bring the family and the era to vibrant life. ""The Green Light"" is as thrilling in its storytelling as any fiction. I can't see why any intelligent general reader--even one who claims not to like poetry--wouldn't think this is a fine book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16AKZEUP6MCFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622293487#wasThisHelpful","R16AKZEUP6MCFK","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Philipp Meyer's ""The Son"" is one of those books that comes out of nowhere to bowl you over with its brilliance. Taking as its epigraph a quote from Gibbon's ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,"" Meyer tells the breathtakingly sweeping story of the rise, decline and fall of the McCulloughs, a Texas ranching and oil family. That capsule description undoubtedly will make you think of ""Dallas,"" but comparing ""Dallas"" with ""The Son"" is like comparing ""Married...With Children"" with ""King Lear.""Meyer's story, sprawling over 160 years of American history, is told through the lives of three main characters in 72 brief, alternating chapters. The main characters are Eli McCullough, patriarch of the family, who spent his youth as a captive of the Comanches; Peter McCullough, Eli's intellectual son, who rebels against his father's kill-or-be-killed view of the world; and Jeanne Anne McCullough, who finds herself trapped as a modern-day woman in upholding the traditions of a violent, sexist frontier society. A fourth character--whose identity must be withheld here--steps forward toward the end to tell his story and bring the novel to its tragic conclusion.The advance publicity compares Meyer with Larry McMurtry and Cormac McCarthy. Both comparisons are apt: he has both McCarthy's violent imagery and grim fatalism, and McMurtry's narrative sweep and richly imagined characters. Meyer's style is every bit as distinguished as McCarthy's or McMurtry's, and his attention to period detail is meticulous and persuasive. One of the book's best chapters is Eli's brief description of the different uses the Comanche made of a killed buffalo. As Eli tells it, they used every part except one. The one part they did not use, and the reason why they did not use it, adds a poignant, ironic sting to the end of the chapter.""The Son"" is a book filled with poignancy and irony, as well as excitement and gore. It makes the point that all the greatest books have made: our characters, our places, and our times equal our destiny. This is a novel that shows every sign of becoming a classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AJ40EAUA0OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062120395#wasThisHelpful","R27AJ40EAUA0OM","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""How Green Was My Valley"" is famous as the film that beat ""Citizen Kane"" for the 1941 Best Picture Oscar. That has dampened the film's reputation, undeservedly. ""How Green Was My Valley"" is one of Ford's greatest achievements--equal to ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or ""The Quiet Man""--and, as the ""Making Of"" documentary of this DVD tell us, it was Ford's personal favorite of all his films.""Citizen Kane"" is the more daring and innovative film, but ""How Green Was My Valley"" has the greater emotional impact. It's a great example of old-fashioned Hollywood filmmaking at its very best. Ford, working with screenwriter Philip Dunne from Richard Llewellyn's book, created a film that combines rollicking humor and tearjerking tragedy with remarkable seamlessness. The actors--from the veterans Donald Crisp, Barry Fitzgerald and Sara Allgood to 13-year-old Roddy McDowall, making his film debut--could not be better. The black-and-white photography by Arthur Miller is breathtakingly beautiful, most notably in two scenes: the scene in the meadow in which Walter Pidgeon encourages McDowall to walk again after a terrible illness, and the hellish subterranean scene of the flooded, caved-in mine at the end.The ""Making Of"" documentary contains a lot of fascinating information about the fraught but fruitful relationship between Ford and Darryl F. Zanuck, two hard-headed control freaks who understood each other very well. It also contains an illuminating quote from Peter Bogdanovich, who was friends with both Welles and Ford. ""Citizen Kane,"" he said, is a movie from the head, whereas ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a movie from the heart. In the end, the only conceivable objection to awarding a Best Picture Oscar to ""How Green Was My Valley"" is that the prize did not go to ""Citizen Kane."" Which movie should have won? That's a matter of opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHLN9HZBAIGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006RCO3#wasThisHelpful","RJHLN9HZBAIGH","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caroline Bottaro's ""Queen to Play"" is a charming, inspiring film about confounding the world's expectations and getting a second chance in life. Helene (Sandrine Bonnaire) is a cleaning woman on the island of Corsica, living a quiet, contented life with her boat-painter husband and teenage daughter. Then, one day, she sees an elegant couple playing chess at the hotel where she works, and something deep inside her clicks. Although she has never played chess before, she suddenly becomes obsessed with the game, playing an electronic chessboard far into the night. She even asks Professor Kroger (Kevin Kline), the curmudgeonly academic whose house she cleans for extra money, to pay her with chess lessons instead.""Queen to Play"" reminded me of the original Japanese version of ""Shall We Dance?,"" about a Japanese salary man whose life is transformed by ballroom dancing. In both movies, just one glance is enough to change a life completely, and for the better. In the making-of featurette on this DVD, Bottaro describes Helene's story as one of class conflict; that is certainly plain when the president of the chess club whose tournament Helene tries to enter suggests that she clean his house instead. But it could just as easily be seen as a woman's struggle in a male-dominated world. When Helene starts spending more time with Professor Kroger and her demeanor changes at work, everyone--including Helene's husband--comes to the usual, and dreary, conclusion.""Queen to Play"" is a touching story about the flowering of an intellect and the empowerment of a working-class woman who leaps over society's expectations to fulfill her dreams. Kevin Kline is persuasively ursine as the professor, and the rest of the cast is fine, but it is Bonnaire who dominates the movie with a moving performance as a woman discovering resources within herself that she didn't even know she had.Graced with jaw-droppingly gorgeous photography of the Corsican coastline, ""Queen to Play"" is a must-see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3912S56UOYQP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HGKXLS#wasThisHelpful","R3912S56UOYQP5","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The exquisitely phrased poems of Bernadette Geyer's ""The Scabbard of Her Throat"" capture the subtle mystery of human existence. Throughout the book--most clearly in the ""Thumbelina's Mother"" poems and the final poem, ""Advice to My Daughter Regarding Houses in the Woods""--Geyer evokes the disturbing, wood-scented depths of Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, intimating that those macabre forests encroach more on our daily lives than we suppose. Geyer's poems contain a vibrant synecdoche, with small things touching a larger thing as Frost said. ""Oyster Shells,"" a shocking meditation on the murder of Hypatia, begins with a remarkable stanza: ""The oyster knows how to keep/a secret, parting its lips/only when boiled alive."" Throughout the book there are lines that take our breath away with a few well-chosen words. ""Asthma Attack"" begins, ""The bird in my throat/will not be still."" ""Without Warning"" contains the stanza, ""They don't mention how quickly/a storm can gather and cross the bay/in the rushed flight of wings and sails."" Geyer is a close observer of the natural world, all the better to present her observations on love, motherhood, and seizing the day. She is a meticulous, abundantly talented poet, and those who read ""The Scabbard of Her Throat"" will cherish her work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNNVEOXOSC56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0915380854#wasThisHelpful","RZNNVEOXOSC56","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lonely Planet's 40th-anniversary edition of its guide to England, as it promises, covers the Scepter'd Isle from Land's End to Lindisfarne. While of necessity--even at nearly 850 pages--it can't provide exhaustive detail on everything it covers, it does give us entertaining and informative snapshots of a wide range of English landmarks and attractions. Of course the most space (about 100 pages) is devoted to London, but there are substantial sections on every region in England, with special attention devoted to major cities and popular tourist areas.Readers look to Lonely Planet to provide the quirky details other guides don't bother with. In its guide to England--the land that invented quirkiness--it certainly doesn't disappoint. The Dinosaurland Fossil Museum in Lyme Regis? The annual Cheese Rolling at Cooper's Hill in the Cotswolds? Ezekial Bone's Robin Hood Tours in Nottingham? They're all there, and much, much more. The lovely thing about the Lonely Planet guides is that they whet your appetite to visit even the places most tourists would never think of going. For example, the guide's authors make a special plea for Bristol as ""one of Britain's quirkiest and coolest cities...reinvent(ing) itself over the past decade as a hub of culture and creativity."" Even with a town like Hull--which the guide admits is ""a curmudgeonly British seaport""--the authors provide an overriding reason to visit: the Larkin Trail, a self-guided tour past significant landmarks in the life of Hull's most famous son, the poet Philip Larkin. (Not surprisingly, considering Larkin's life, the landmarks include a goodly number of pubs.Lonely Planet's England guide is an excellent trip planner. Even more, however, it is a wish book, revealing all the charming places we tourists would visit if we only had the time. It helps us travel in our imaginations, as much as in reality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1OD7QX7A2YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742200508#wasThisHelpful","R2A1OD7QX7A2YF","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Derek Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a hard film to review. I can't help but feel that too many reviewers, both on Amazon and elsewhere, have told too much of the story. This is what I knew going to see the movie: that it starred Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper as antagonistic characters on opposite sides of the law, and that the story took place over a number of years (15, to be exact). I'm glad I didn't know anything more than that, because the surprises Cianfrance had in store for me took my breath away.You already know the story in detail if you've read any other reviews, but here is what I feel safe in telling you:1. Gosling, as a daredevil motorcyclist turned bank robber, dominates the first half of ""The Place Beyond the Pines.""2. Cooper, as a cop turned district attorney, is the main character of the second half, though there are also important plot twists involving Emory Cohen, as Cooper's son, and Dane DeHaan, as Gosling's.3. All four aforementioned actors are wonderful, as are Eva Mendes, as the love of Gosling's life; Ben Mendelsohn, as Gosling's partner in crime; Ray Liotta, as Cooper's corrupt superior in the police department; Rose Byrne, as Cooper's wife; and Harris Yulin, as Cooper's politically savvy father.4. Despite the sprawling structure of ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Cianfrance's direction keeps us on the edge of our seats for most of its 140-minute running time. He is helped immeasurably by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt and editors Jim Helton and Ron Patane. The opening sequence, showing a heavily tattooed Gosling swaggering his way through a carnival crowd, is a wow, as is a chase scene in the middle of the movie between Gosling and Cooper.5. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" reminds me of some of the great old TV miniseries, such as ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" and ""Captains and the Kings."" The thrust of its story, however, is as old as the Bible, with the fathers eating sour grapes and the sons' teeth being set on edge. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is messy in its structure, and not every loose end gets tied. But it is powerful and moving, and I think its reputation will grow with the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B69H61JGDXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYKM6#wasThisHelpful","R2B69H61JGDXG","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Woody Allen's ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" simmers entertainingly for a while, thanks largely to a gifted cast, but it never comes amywhere near a boil. This is because the characters are neither interesting nor likable. Gemma Jones, as a flighty, severely depressed woman who finds solace in the occult, comes closest to gaining our sympathy; her scenes with a fortune teller played by Pauline Collins are the best in the movie. As a big fan of ""The Duchess of Duke Street,"" I'm delighted to see Jones in such a prominent part.However, everyone else is boring--even the great Anthony Hopkins, because his character is the same dull beige as all the other characters. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" had a similar problem, only ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" doesn't have Penelope Cruz or the scenery of Barcelona to compensate us. There is a beguiling plot twist involving Josh Brolin, as a failed novelist, and his friend's unpublished manuscript, and it's mordantly amusing how Allen keeps that plot angle dangling over Brolin's head, like the sword of Damocles. However, that story line and Gemma Jones' performance aren't enough to make the movie satisfying in the end. I don't mind that the various storylines are inconclusive, but I DO mind that I didn't really care how or if they concluded. ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is just another of a string of movies Allen has been making recently, about coddled, privileged people who are vaguely yet permanently dissatisfied with their lives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QHB9UJLSALK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UESJCY#wasThisHelpful","R39QHB9UJLSALK","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who has read Christopher Conlon's previous work--such as his novels, ""Midnight on Mourn Street"" and ""A Matrix of Angels,"" and his books of poetry including ""Mary Falls"" and ""Gilbert and Garbo in Love""--knows he is a masterful storyteller with a finely honed sense of the macabre. ""Herding Ravens: Bon-Bons and Cold Cuts"" is a delightfully creepy collection of Conlon's short-short stories, some no longer than a single page. ""A bon-bon,"" Conlon tells us in the flash fiction that serves as an introduction, ""is a very short tale of fantasy with no rules or logic, or with dream logic, or the logic of the grave."" The twenty-six stories in ""Herding Ravens"" live up to that description.Conlon's hero Edgar Allan Poe is invoked in ""The Raven 2"" and is actually a character in the final story, aptly named ""The End."" But the stories mark Conlon as a scholar of horror and thriller fiction. Throughout the book, you will hear echoes of H.P. Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson, Cornell Woolrich, Patricia Highsmith, all blended together in a witty, ironic manner that is Conlon's own. My favorite story in the collection is the saddest and most elegiac--""Wild Radish,"" a story of a very old man, the last representative of his civilization. Other winners include ""I, Ringo,"" an alternative history of the Fab Four; ""A Cup of Coffee,"" which in a just world would have been filmed by Alfred Hitchcock; ""Say Cheese,"" which will give you pause the next time someone takes your picture; and ""How to Live if Not Why,"" a bracing variation on ""The Devil's Dictionary."" (""Since living with air conditioning is basically living in a refrigerator, use air conditioning liberally. This is good practice for when you'll be in the morgue."") But there isn't a dud in the bunch, and it's likely your favorites will be entirely different from mine. In any case, ""Herding Ravens"" is a wonderful choice for readers who love a good scare before bedtime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26BE9LXYCV0TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985194081#wasThisHelpful","R26BE9LXYCV0TU","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most brilliant scene in Kenneth Branagh's ""As You Like It"" is Kevin Kline, as Jaques, delivering a golden-throated version of the ""Seven Ages of Man"" soliloquy as Branagh's camera swirls around him. The entire cast is excellent: Bryce Dallas Howard is a radiant Rosalind, and Brian Blessed is majestic--no other word will do--in his dual role as the deposed and usurper Dukes. The photography, by Roger Lanser, is exquisite, capturing enchanting scenes of bucolic beauty. Yet for all its excellent parts, Branagh's ""As You Like It"" feels slightly off. He gives us no good reason why he sets the play in a late-19th-century European enclave in Japan; except for staging the wrestling match between Orlando and Charles as a sumo bout, the mix of English and Japanese costumes and customs is unpersuasive. Of course, Japan is beautiful--but so is England, where the film was actually shot, and where of course the play was originally set.""As You Like It"" contains nothing as jarring as Keanu Reeves' off-key performance in Branagh's version of ""Much Ado About Nothing."" But neither does it have the magical cohesiveness of the earlier film, and without that ""As You Like It"" is just a collection of eccentric scenes, albeit interspered with some of the most soaring poetry in the English language. For its pictorial beauty and the excellence of its cast, however, I give Branagh's ""As You Like It"" four stars out of five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396QRQOB3QE47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SM6FKE#wasThisHelpful","R396QRQOB3QE47","A1FG91CM8221X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FG91CM8221X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This works great for hiding in and using for many things.

"This is one solid piece and very well made. I love that it has foldable hooks in the front of the 5-position wall organizer for handled tools,  It holds Up To 11 Tools.  It is so easy to release cleaning tools by lifting the handle.The rolling balls automatically adjust to each handle's thickness and grips it securely. Holds Wide Variety of cleaning tools or more.Can be used in the house or garage.  I was shocked how much each ball hold,s up to 7 pounds of weight. So anything over 7 pounds like shovels will be too heavy.  You want to hang this well with anchors if you want it to be sturdy.  It attaches to the wall by screws.The diameter size of broom/mop handles fits: 18mm - 28mm.  Item size: 41cm*6cm*8cm / 16.1"" *2.3"" *3.1"".

"I take fish oil every day and I have for many many years. My issue has been that a lot give you a fishy after taste or I end up burping fish. YUCK. But I know I don't get enough Omega 3 and have diabetes and was DR ordered, First off there is no fishy taste what so ever and no burping it either. It has Tripled the strength of the leading brand and its is high in EPA and DHA and my Dr said  A regular intake of EPA and DHA plays a very positive role in my health. When made available to the body, EPA and DHA are incorporated into cell membranes (such as heart cells) and support a critical role in keeping cells membranes flexible. EPA and DHA come from omega-3s that are naturally found in oily fish like salmon, halibut, sardines and anchovies, And this fish oil is from sardines, herring & anchovies.  My Dr also said that Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil can help lower triglycerides and apoproteins (markers of diabetes), and raise HDL. So eating foods or taking fish oil supplements may help people with diabetes. Which I have had for the last 39 yrs.

No light from the outside comes thru. It is so neat. I am still learning all it can do. It is great entertainment and I am sure it would burn up hours of fun.

It ends up being up half the night cleaning when there's an accident.  And we end up sleep half the day away. This is godsent. and  helps us sleep sound and thru the night not worrying if there is an accident we only have to change to another one (which we have purchased already.)

"This Left Coast Performance MCT Oil is a Huge bottle it is 32 Oz.  Use This Pure MCT Oil for Bulletproof Coffee, (recipe at the end of review) MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides), which are largely missing from typical diets, are saturated fats easier to digest than the more common LCTs (long-chain triglycerides). Your body sends them straight to your liver, where they raise your metabolism and are burned as fuel instead of being stored as fat. These fatty acids show potential in maintaining healthy weight and diminishing fat storage in many trials of MCT. Medium chain fats help you feel full more than long-chain fatty acids youâd find in vegetable oils.

"First off I need all the help I can get to strengthen my immune system T1 diabetes for 39 yrs. This Reishi Mushroom Extract Powder by Real Mushrooms is a fine brown powder. It mixes well in coffee and hot cocoa and I put it in Pumpkin shakes My favorite kind of shake. By itself at it tastes Like unsweetened dark chocolate with a little kick. This is an  Immune System Booster The water-soluble polysaccharides, beta-glucans, and hetero-beta-glucans, are active ingredients found in the red reishi mushroom, which is the highest-quality form you can get. These polysaccharides boost the immune system, fight tumors, and lower blood pressure. Reishi also contains the ling zhi-8 protein, which boosts the immune system, too. Supplementing with reishi is considered to be very safe. Reishi is an antioxidant that promotes a feeling of overall wellness by eliminating hydroxyl free radicals and improving the bodyâs ability to use oxygen. Reishi is effective at lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels, thanks to both the polysaccharides, and another active ingredient, triterpenes, which is found in reishi in a class known as ganoderic acids. This is just some of the benefits of Reishi Mushroom extract power.

"I got this for my Dad as he has some major issues with his feet. They smell horrible and he has nail fungus and gets Athletes Foot. Plus his feet hurt him every day. So we started to use the first day he got it. Directions Place two heaping tablespoons in a container large enough to accommodate both feet. Add approximately one gallon of warm water and mix until salts are dissolved. Relax and soak your tired feet for 10-15 minutes. We noticed that the smell of hi feet was a lot better. But we really noticed that when he came home from work. He continued to use every day and he really liked how relaxing it was.It just seems to take all the hard days work away. After about a week, we noticed how much better his nail Fungus was and the athletes foot was gone. He will keep using and will be getting more.

"I am always looking for a supplement that are good for me. I already was told over a year ago I am low on D3 and was taking 50,000 a week. But talking with my DR we decided it would be best to add K2, vitamin D is a critical nutrient for optimal health and is best obtained from sun exposure or a safe tanning bed.However, many are taking oral vitamin D, Like me, which may become problematic unless you're also getting sufficient amounts of vitamin K2.Vitamin K2 engages in a delicate dance with vitamin D, and you need both in adequate amounts for optimal health.Vitamin D and Vitamin K2 Slow the Progression of Arterial Calcification. This is what my DR told me. So I have been taking this for a month now and will continue. This pill is easy to chew and taste good. I take 2 of these per day per my DR orders. (otherwise go by the bottles instructions) And supplement the rest with just D3 pills.  I feel so much better, the biggest is my energy level and my Mood is uplifted and overâ all feel better.

"This Grinder is different than any other one I have had. I was used to where you grind on top and then main parts of the grind stays there and then the residue(small grind Like powder Pollen)goes to the bottom. But this Spice Up Your Life Herb Grinder has an extra part where the grind goes to a middle part. This is also so cool that it is so versatile  first it is a 4 piece grinder for your herbs with pollen catcher or a 3 piece grinder which allows you to have larger herbs for your culinary dishes. Remove the Pollen catcher chamber and use your grinder as a compact 3-part pocket grinder , small and ready to roll.  This works well and is very easy to use.

"This Premium Stainless Steel Zester with Safety Gaurd for Cheese, Lemons, Limes, Chocolate and Spicesby Kozy Kitchen Works is the first MicroPlane I have had. So I am learning so many ways to use it, Here are some1) Zesting citrus â This Microplane makes zesting effortless.2) Shaving Parmesan or other hard cheeses â It makes it easy to grate right onto your plate of spaghetti. I have even used it for less-hard cheeses, like cheddar.3) Grating ginger â Pro-tip: You don't really need to peel ginger; just scrub it well. Then store it in the freezer to make grating even easier. It will stay fresh and grate nicely without getting all juicy.4) Mincing garlic â I love how fast and easy it is to grate a clove of garlic straight into the frying pan.5) Shaving chocolate â A fancy garnish for cake or ice cream.6) Grating whole nutmeg, cinnamon â A quick way to grind your own spices for a fresher taste.7) Mincing onion â Sometimes you don't want chunks of onion, and while using a microplane can get a little juicy here, it's great for meatballs, tacos or dip where you want the onion to blend right in.8) Grating dried mushrooms â Ever thought to use dried mushroom powder as a seasoning? Me neither, but this article from the Washington Post teaches you how. http://voices.washingtonpost.com/all-we-can-eat/i-spice/i-spice-mushroom-powder.html Sounds great on steak, right?9) Mincing hot peppers â For the same reason you may not want chunks of chopped onion in a dish.10) Grating nuts â Another nice garnish for desserts or even oatmeal. So as you can see I am trying all kinds of ways to use this. I love to cook.  This Microplane is made very well.  It is easy to use and to hold. The guard is great to protect it  and other items around it when stored.

"While many books on the topic of depression tend to focus on one particular aspect of the complex issue, Mark has done an excellent job of offering up a balanced book that manages to relate to readers with personal anecdotes and encouragement while at the same time offering up intensely practical advice and logical explanations based on a scriptural worldview.Throughout the book, you will find numerous references to personal experiences, scripture, historical examples, parables, current events, and studies that help to back up the advice and explanations. Those conclusions are organized into easy-to-read bulleted lists and action points. I REALLY like the ""Take-Home Tidbits"" at the end of each chapter with the key statements! They help to provide extra clarity with complicated topics.For such a heavy topic, the book is easy to read and flows well.

" 2:00 MinsI purchased this bottle locally here in Kathmandu and have used it extensively over the last month. It works equally well for hiking through the hills doing relief work and surveying destroyed villages as it does in the big city stuffed in my EDC bag. On the trail, the squeeze-to-squirt mouthpiece is great because you don't have to remove a cap or pull a tab before drinking. This simple lack of an extra barrier had me taking swigs more often and staying better hydrated. When carried in the bag, the mouthpiece still seals things well enough that I don't have to worry when carrying it with papers, books, etc. I have only used the lock when it was in my hiking bag carried on the roof of a jeep with loads of other stuff on top of it.Oh, and the insulation... I didn't really get the insulation to keep the drink insulated so much as to keep the bottle from sweating when I put cold water in and throw it in my EDC bag. It works just as well as I hoped.

"While there are features to like with this unit, I couldn't rely on it and it is sitting on a shelf somewhere.This is only the second powerpack that I have owned. The other unit is slightly bulkier and was purchased ~3years ago. I was looking forward to seeing how things have advanced since that point and letting my wife keep this in her purse.When I received the unit it was empty and needed charged. The charging didn't take too long, but when I plugged in my phone for charging, it charged extremely slowly. I switched to the cable that I always use, but it didn't help. After some time, I came back and found that the battery pack had switched off on it's own after charging only 1% of my phone battery(Oneplus One). I didn't have time to keep an eye on it, so I put it away to deal with later.My son was in the hospital this past week and I grabbed this power bank to keep our phones alive during the ordeal. I was expecting slow charging and having to keep an eye on it, but what else did I have to do? It performed even worse than before. I was attempting to charge my OPO and my wife's GS3, but neither got even a single % of charge from the unit.I am glad that this was not the only power bank I brought to the hospital. I switched back to my trusty old NewTrent iCarrier backup battery and had both phones charged in no time.I don't know what the problem was. When plugged in, the phone would indicate that it was charging. The battery pack was freshly charged and the little flashlight LED worked well.

"I have used the more expensive Plantronics Backbeat Go headphones for some time and was interested to see how these less expensive headphones compare. The most obvious difference is the size. The Mpow heaphones are massive and look like they wouldn't even stay in my ears, however after wearing them, I found that, despite their size, retention is not an issue. These will definitely not fit under a motorcycle helmet and will even be uncomfortable under a knit cap that covers the ears.That being said, the battery life on these headphones is significantly better than my smaller plantronics headphones. I don't know if the extra space is dedicated to the battery, but these lasted more than twice as long as the smaller plantronics.The usb charging port cover has a good seal, but is a little difficult to dislodge without longer nails.In the end, these get used every day while around the house, but I would hesitate to wear them out in public, while jogging, riding, etc.These headphones were sent to me free of charge for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SNNPBVZ3PVHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZTHGN2#wasThisHelpful","R1SNNPBVZ3PVHI","A1SKME00QMJR6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SKME00QMJR6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bluetooth speaker resides in our shower. I was hoping to mount it under the water somewhere to test the waterproofing, but ended up with it mounted on the back wall. Using this speaker has been a simple and delightful experience. It was easy to set-up and pair with my mobile.

The speaker itself is nothing to write home about, but come on, you are listening in a shower. You don't need perfect audio with water splashing all around. The volume is good.

"From the moment I heard about this book, it intrigued me. I have lived in Nepal for the past four years, traveling primarily by motorcycle. Add that to the fact that I have close family living in China for the past 7 years and I had to read this book.The story is very well told. It is obvious that the Pyle brothers thought about the story-telling aspect of the trip in advance. Obviously, they were preparing for the video documentary(which I haven't seen yet), but they also did a good job of documenting the details of the trip day by day. After a large undertaking like this, it is easy to forget the ups and downs encountered through the experience itself, but having documented the trip well, they were able to share the fears, disappointments, in an emotionally honest way that has the reader wondering about the outcome of the trip even though we already know(from the product description) that they were successful.I appreciated how the authors didn't belittle the cultural differences that were highlighted throughout their trip. Some travel/adventure writers take this opportunity to make the foreign culture look stupid, but the Pyle brothers attempted to explain the rationale behind many of the utterly confusing decisions and actions of the police, proprietors, and other people that they met along the way.I found the book to be the perfect length for this type of story. This is not a long book and it doesn't drag things out, but it isn't so short that you feel cheated either. I am a pretty fast reader and was able to finish the story in two sittings of several hours each.My biggest complaint is actually a rather small one. I was annoyed by the small grammar mistakes throughout. Simple things like ""forward and backward"" instead of ""back and forth"". No, they don't confuse readers, but they distract from an otherwise fantastic story. A professional copy-editor could polish this into a 5-star book in no time!If you are are a fan of the travel adventure non-fiction genre and want to hear some interesting and insightful stories about areas of China that few have visited, you will love this book!Full disclosure: I was given a (digital) copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSU3JCB0397P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVCCLUY#wasThisHelpful","RSU3JCB0397P2","A1SKME00QMJR6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SKME00QMJR6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Life changing little information robot.First, just the basics- what do I use Echo for?1. ""Alexa, what's the weather forecast?""2. ""Alexa, tell me the news.""3. (Lying in bed in the morning) ""Alexa, what time is it?""4. ""Alexa, what is my schedule like today/tomorrow/this week?""5. (I have Phillips Hue LED lights) ""Alexa turn off all the lights.""6. ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights.""7. ""Alexa, set a 5 minute timer.""8.  ""Alexa, tell me when it is 8:00.""9. ""Alexa who starred in XYZ movie?""  (Or any other general fact-finding)10. ""Alexa, tell me a joke.""Her voice recognition is not perfect, but it gets better every day.Amazon continues to add features and capabilities, such as control of music playlists, Spotify/Pandora, wifi-enabled LED lights, Google calendar, etc.Everyone talks about how robots will be a big thing in the future.  Well, the future is here.  Alexa is an information and home automation robot.  I don't need an expensive robot to do manual things like vacuum my floor.  What makes the most sense is an ""information robot"" like her, who can harness the power of the internet to give me information.Before you tell me how Siri on the iPhone can do the same thing, let me tell you, it's A LOT more convenient to simply talk to a robot that is always on than to go get your iPhone, unlock it, find the Hue lights app, and turn lights off or on. Same with Siri searches. It's just easier and intuitive to use voice commands to simply tell Alexa to do something.I have no doubt that some form of this information robot will be found in EVERY home over the next few years.  It just makes so much sense- voice control of your home.  Control temperature, play music, set timers, turn on and off lights, all with voice commands.My only complaint is this robot doesn't play all that well with Apple which is Apple's fault.  It's hard to play songs from iTunes or have it tell you your iCloud calendar.  No problem; I've just switched my calendaring to Google instead.The bigger question- why in the world is Amazon innovating so much more than Apple?I want to buy another echo for my office.

"Good idea!This is a good idea- incorporate modern LED technology into a grilling spatula.  Shine light on your dark grill.  Who hasn't wished they had more light on their grill, especially as the sun goes down on those late summer nights?Well, it works.  But the actual object is so clunky and ugly that it looks and feels about as elegant as if a kid had taken a flashlight and rubber-banded it to the handle of a cheap spatula.This object is an example of the things that discourage me about modern life.  The designers don't even take the time or effort to make something that looks and feels nice.  I guess it costs more money to do that.  But it seems like if they would just spend a little effort and cost in the design of the product, then mass produce it in China like always, but this way it's at least a nice thing you are making millions of.Too bad- the extra cost, spread out over so many more units sold, would be more than worth the time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOT153CO2X0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2DPTZW#wasThisHelpful","R3BOT153CO2X0L","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dated, but still informative book about Silicon Valley.  The author admits that it will be dated, due to the rapid change that has always been the nature of the Valley.  The book would have held up better if it had been more of a history book with some key locations such as companies, museums, and universities, and less restaurants.  But to be fair, the restaurants are often included due to proximity near a major tech company or when it is frequented by tech luminaries.Overall this is solid book that will be of  interest mainly to real geeks and those interested in silicon valley history. My favorite parts of the book by far are the ones that tell the history of the various tech companies and personalities.The formatting is terrible on the Kindle version of this book due to the sidebars.

"Very solid, decent looking rack at a reasonable price.My only criticism, keeping it from being 5 stars, is that the assembly instructions are poorly written.  They consist of a single page of tiny print with a couple of diagrams.  Having said that, it still only took about 30 minutes to assemble, but it was not a fun process.  But luckily, you only have to do this once.My box initially was missing 2 parts, but the people at Nashbar promptly mailed me the missing parts.  Great customer service.So how does the rack work?  It works really well.  I have two bikes on my rack, a fixie and a carbon fiber roadbike.  The rack is easily adjustable so you can get your bikes positioned perfectly, regardless of frame type.The rack is a little bigger than I was expecting, but it is also a lot more stable than I was expecting.  You do NOT need to anchor this to the wall or the floor.  It can easily hold two bikes and still feels fairly stable.  I wouldn't do work on my bikes on this rack, but it is definitely stable for holding the bikes.It looks great with the bikes stacked above each other, raised off the floor.

"This book is well researched, and the author had great access to Elon Musk. The style is fast paced, yet detailed enough to give some great insight into the man and his companies.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it is a âmust-readâ for anyone investing in Tesla stock or its competitors.I do have a couple of criticisms: first, the part about the Justine Musk divorce was a nearly word for word copy of her blog describing her side of the story.  I was shocked by how similar it was. Also, the last chapter ""unified field theory of Elon Musk"" seemed to be unnecessary padding, wasting time on other people's opinions on Musk.  It didnât fit into the biography.  Perhaps it was an attempt to ensure that the book doesn't come across as hagiography.Some interesting points about Elon Musk:1. He eats fast2. He has had a challenging life: the loss of an infant, a brutal upbringing in South Africa, pushed out of companies he co-founded, nearly going broke in 2008, divorces3. Late bloomer; he was more ambitious in college than he was in high school4. Extremely hard worker; for the first three months of his first start-up he and his brother literally lived in the office.  He slept on a beanbag next to his desk. Justine said: ""Elon would come home at 11 and work some more.  People didn't always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was.""  His co-investor Gracias said: ""He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I've ever met.  What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else.  He didn't just survive.  He kept working and stayed focused. Most people under that sort of pressure fray, their decisions go bad.  Elon gets hyperrational.  He's still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy.  I've just never seen anything like his ability to take pain."" Watson at SpaceX said: ""I don't want to be the person who ever has to compete with Elon.  You might as well leave the business and find something else fun to do. He will outmaneuver you, outthink you, and out-execute you.""5. Very intelligent and self-taught in many fields; he read books about rockets and propulsion to start Space X.  Maniacal attention to detail.6. He doesn't spend time on niceties or ""building relationships"" other than family or close work colleagues because he is too busy and smart to want to waste time.7. Not afraid to face withering criticism: he faced tremendous resistance on the idea of electric cars and had to invest mostly his own money in the company.8. He nearly went broke in 2008: ""he looked like death itself,"" said Riley.  He would have nightmares and yell out, his weight fluctuated wildly, he had bags under his eyes, and they had to start borrowing money from his friend.  He no longer flew his jet back and forth between LA and Silicon Valley- he took Southwest.Some good quotes:""Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation."" â the authorMusk: ""That's my lesson from taking a vacation: vacations will kill you."" after he nearly died from malaria from a trip to Africa.""The longer you wait to fire someone the longer it has been since you should have fired them.""""I will spend my last dollar on these companies.  If we have to move into Justine's parents' basement, we'll do it.""  -Elon MuskThings I took away:â¢ I expected to read the book to be mostly interested in Elon Musk and Tesla and instead the SpaceX portion was the more interesting part.  The amazing effort and persistence in the face of constant set-backs was mind-blowing. He sunk millions of his own money into the company- basically, all of his net worth went into TSLA and SpaceX and he lost all of it by 2008 when the cars weren't selling and the rockets weren't working.  Yet today, both companies are worth billions because he said he would live in his parent-in-laws' basement if that is what it took to succeed.â¢ I didn't realize how close both TSLA and SpaceX were from going broke.  He had to put in his last $12 million cash.â¢ Interesting fact: if you buy a Tesla car, they will give you the option of picking it up in Silicon Valley and touring the factory where it was made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YROUWG8NVL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVI76ZS#wasThisHelpful","R10YROUWG8NVL7","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fantastic glasses; good value.Although I have broken countless wine glasses in my lifetime, I still enjoy wine more in half-way decent glasses.

"This watch is almost the perfect watch. If you define a watch as a beautiful, simple object whose form and function are in perfect harmony, this may be the ideal watch.Simple minimalism, yet not stark.  Light weight, but not flimsy. Quartz movement keeps time perfectly.A perfect balance between casual and ""dressy,"" this watch is equally at home on a wrist with a business suit or workout clothes.  It is so versatile that you can wear it with anything and it blends in.  It is also a nice counterbalance to the digital era we live in.The value is extraordinary.  When I wear nice work clothes, I get a lot of compliments on this watch.  People think it is a very expensive watch.  The great thing is it is very inexpensive, so it is also a ""low concern"" watch, unlike my Rolex which I always feel is delicate and too valuable to wear daily.  This is exactly the watch I would recommend for someone who needs to look decent on job interviews but does not have the funds for an expensive Swiss watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ONQRL8QV6LQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00492Z370#wasThisHelpful","R3ONQRL8QV6LQ1","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"High quality, non-slip gloves.If you are like me, you clean, wash dishes, and do a lot of routine bike and home maintenance.  It's pretty rough on your hands, exposing them to detergents, washing liquids, grease and grime all the time.  I have tried nitrile gloves before and they were always too flimsy and too slippery.These gloves solve both of those problems.  They are very durable and with the textured surface, they actually give you a good grip on things, even when wet.  I have not broken one of these yet, except for taking one pair off after a long cleaning sessions.These can be used to wash dishes with confidence that you will not drop a dish.  They give enough tactile feel for working on bikes and cars.A couple of side benefits: they are somewhat heat resistant, so I find that I can wash dishes with almost steaming water without burning my hands. The orange color is also cool!The only drawback to these gloves is they are so useful that I end up using a pair every day- uses for them will occur to you that you never imagined.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FU0B5B8H4FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGSGRIS#wasThisHelpful","R3FU0B5B8H4FP","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Do we really need another Zagat-style book on the high-end restaurants that you can either not afford to dine in or can't get a reservation at?In each chapter, he picks a different specific food, such as Pizza, Fried Chicken, Pho, or even Pastrami, and tells the history of the food in New York, and discusses the best places to get the food.  The guide is both up to date, and timeless because he shares the history of each specific dish in NYC.Even the most experienced NYC eater will learn new things here.

"Fantastic!I never thought I could get this excited about a simple light bulb.This amazing LED bulb is so well constructed and the light quality is so soft and nice that it is just as good as an incandescent bulb.  Wait- it's even better!  Why?1. LEDs will last 10-20 years.  These lightbulbs will go with me when I move to my next place.2. LEDs use 1/10th the power of old light bulbs.  Good for the environment, and saves wasted dollars going to the utility.3.  This one is so solid and well-built that you don't need to replace them every year.4.  Price is good now- the prices have come down so much that in relation to the energy savings and the longer life, they are actually about 1/10th the cost of a regular bulb.I put these bulbs in my entry way, which has recessed fixtures by the entryway.  It's always hard to replace these bulbs, since I have high ceilings and I have to get a ladder out to change them.  Well, I just changed them for the last time for maybe a decade!The advances in LED bulbs lately is mind-blowing.

"Brilliant, unfiltered, rollercoaster ride with Bourdain.Bourdain follows up Kitchen Confidential with a nice collection of unvarnished observations and opinions about a wide range of topics.His discourse on the importance of EVERYONE learning basic cooking skills may be worth the price of the book itself. ""Basic knife skills should be a must. Nothing too serious.  Just enough facility with a knife to be on par with any Sicilian grandmother.""  Words of wisdom concerning the merits of attending cooking school and career advice to aspiring chefs is priceless for those so inclined.  Like Michael Douglas, surprised that his Gordon Gekko character inspired a generation of young people to go work on Wall Street, Bourdain marvels that people still want to become a chef despite his blunt talk in Kitchen Confidential.He opines on the sorry state of Food Inc., and the danger of eating hamburgers in this country: ""Call me crazy, but I believe that when you're making hamburger for human consumption, you should at no time deem it necessary or desirable to treat its ingredients in ammonia.  Or any cleaning product, for that matter.""One of the best parts is his soul-searching after the break-up of his first marriage, and how he struggled as an aspiring writer and slightly burnt-out chef.Bourdain may be more introspective, but make no mistake, he still retains his rapier wit.  He pens an entire chapter to vilify (mediocre yet famous) food critic Alan Richman.  He pulls no punches, entitling the chapter ""Alan Richman is a douchebag.""Still ""uncut"" he writes lines like this one, when describing an episode of a cooking contest TV show: ""The plate looked like the last shot of a backache video - filmed at Chilis.""  This is why I love Bourdain.For me, the absolute climax of the book is the chapter in which he describes the dominican man, Justo, the fish prep chef for Le Bernardin.  Again, if the book had only this chapter, it would be worth the price.  Bourdain again shows his humanity when he takes Justo to eat at Le Bernardin for lunch- the first time the man had ever eaten the food he has spent years prepping for cooking.Must-read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266K3E480U401/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JBI2WU#wasThisHelpful","R266K3E480U401","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fortunately I am a persistent person, because I was able to wade through the first 60 pages of minutiae including a few pages discussing how she got sick on crab meat at a dinner in New York City.  Perhaps there was some deep metaphor or she was instead just writing the banality of her life to set the tempo for her eventual disintegration into madness.When she finally descends into ""The Bell Jar"" of lunacy is when the writing soars.

It is also interesting how much MORE leafy and tree-lined Brooklyn is today than it was 50-100 years ago.  The early photos of the bridges are probably the most spell-binding.

"Irvine Welsh doing what he does best: making despicable actions by unsavory characters fascinating and likable.This fast-paced novel is written from a variety of viewpoints.  It centers on Lucy Brennan, shallow, manic personal fitness trainer in Miami Beach, and her fitness client muse, artist Lena Sorenson.  He threads their stories through the third main character: South Beach.  He skewers the shallow Miami culture, the art world, and even U.S. culture as a whole in this entertaining novel.As fun as it is to read, I felt like it needed a bit of editing.  Some motifs that ran throughout the book didn't quite have enough gravity and felt gimmicky.  Welsh does not seem to care about ""economy of character"" because the central opening event of the story doesn't even factor into the book later, which was a bit disorienting.This is no ""Trainspotting"" but it is an entertaining read, perhaps on your way to Art Basel in Miami.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYP80QBRWXFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553938X#wasThisHelpful","R1EYP80QBRWXFL","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Haunting, deeply moving book.This lovely, meandering epic coming of age story concerns Astrid and her mother Ingrid, who has been imprisoned for murder.  Astrid goes through a handful of foster homes and all of the dysfunction that it entails.At times this book is moving, at other times shocking, it ultimately attempts to answer the question: why and how do mothers and daughters relate to each other?  The depth of the writing is amazing for a ""first"" novel (Janet Fitch had actually been writing for at least a decade before this book was published).The only part I found a bit distracting was Astrid, the narrator's habit of needing to make even mundane details sound poetic.  I suppose it was done for effect, to show the way she thinks, but it was at times tiresome.  Of course, at other times, it was lyrical and beautiful and the prose soared.The subject matter can be shocking, as it includes explicit sexual descriptions, drug use and violence.  it is never gratuitous, however, as it is intended to be an accurate portrayal of foster home life.There are many, many messages here, as Fitch is ambitious and covers a lot of themes- loneliness, sex, mothers and daughters,class issues, the racial divide and how women are treated in modern culture.  Los Angeles as a setting is the third most important character in the book.Astrid's mother writes to her:""The best you'll ever do is to understand yourself, know what it is that you want, and not let the cattle stand in your way.""And Astrid thinks: ""I hated my mother but I craved her.""Complex.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKTF2KAHWYV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UV73MC#wasThisHelpful","R1QKTF2KAHWYV9","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well-researched, this book is destined to become the definitive summary of Amazon's first 20 years.This fascinating book gives some insights into what Amazon is like today and what it was like as it grew like crazy from startup to behemoth.  The author writes in an accessible, fast-paced style.  This is no hagiography; author Brad Stone has portrayed Jeff Bezos as a maniacal, almost mad genius. At times he paints this picture of Bezos as a cult-like figure.We learn a lot of previously unknown biographical information about Jeff Bezos.  But to me, it all seemed fairly superficial and it didn't do enough to paint a picture of the man Jeff Bezos.  Fairly boilerplate stuff about how Bezos went to gifted public schools and was very smart.When it comes to Amazon itself, the most fascinating part by far was the many challenges the company faced.  The growing pains were never-ending.  I got the impression from reading this book that the whole thing was holding on by a thread and threatening to careen off the tracks multiple times during the first few years.Unfortunately, other than a cursory description of the fulfilment centers and some attempts to illustrate the unique corporate culture, it feels like writer Brad Stone didn't ACTUALLY get that much access to Amazon itself.  Perhaps due to its extreme secrecy, as a reader, I never truly felt like I was ""inside"" the company.  The story is still compelling.My only complaint is Stone's obvious bias against Amazon.  He paints them as ruthless in cutting prices from the mega sized suppliers and companies like book publishers, the music industry and hard goods producers.  How is it so bad that Amazon is doing this, all for the consumer?  He even paints Amazon as evil for scouring the web to find if other sites price goods more cheaply, so they can match their price.  The most ludicrous example of Stone's outrage is when Amazon battles against Wusthoff's anti-consumer price fixing strategy.  Stone himself admits their knives for $159 retail price are nearly the same as $20 knives at department stores.  Wusthoff is the number one knife seller in the US and trying to maintain extremely high margins.  How is Amazon bad for trying to cut those prices for consumers?If you admire Amazon, especially from a customer point of view, this book will not change your mind.If you invest in stocks, this book is a must-read, because it will pound home the great lengths Bezos is going to in order to change retailing forever.  Anyone who runs retail stores of any size must read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386XVS5C27CP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWQW73E#wasThisHelpful","R386XVS5C27CP0","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best reading device of all time. (So far.)- Amazing screen, although the resolution difference from the previous Paperwhite is too subtle for me to notice.- Light, small, grippy in your hands- Haptics are also too subtle and I ended up moving pages the ""old way"" by touching the screen itself- Long battery life as advertisedNegative:- I don't like where they place the power button.  It's in a weird location on the back instead of on the side like most tablet-like gadgets. They may have copied the way Apple puts the power button on the back of the iMac.  This is great for esthetics but lousy for daily use as I find myself fumbling around looking for the power buttonAmazon, in the Kindle franchise, has made the absolutely best reader in the world.  It has taken several iterations, but they have relentlessly improved both the hardware and the software.Ignore the newspaper reviews that say ""Why would anyone pay this much for a single-use device.""

"Brilliant, epic coming of age story.In this ambitious, massive novel, Dickens brings plots, subplots, and unforgettable characters together to address themes of wealth's corrosive influence, the pain of love, and the meaning of friendship.Although written in a dated, flowery, difficult style (by design), the actual ideas that Dickens explores are timeless.  Not an easy read, but a worthwhile read.The tone is dark, gothic, and foreboding.  Dickens at times is lyrical in his descriptions of London of old.  Central character Kip is complex; at times we love him, pity him, and dislike him.  But we are never bored.My favorite theme he illustrates is the idea of falling in love with the wrong person- especially how men can fall in love with women that do not love them at all.  In fact, they often fall for the worst possible woman for them.If you never were ""forced"" to read this in a literature class, try it out, you may love it.  If you did wade through it as a young person, give it another try as an adult- it is certain to move you in a very different way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMKENVQHWPKK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EG0L5OA#wasThisHelpful","RMKENVQHWPKK1","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just fantastic.  Worth every penny.  Once you cook with All-Clad copper core cookware, everything else seems flimsy in comparison.I use this saucepan for small sauces and to do small water boils for things such as poaching eggs and small servings of pasta.  It is perfect for these projects.The construction is superb.  Truly a thing of beauty, the pan is solid, perfectly machined, and the inside is smooth and gleams with stainless steel perfection.  It is not non-stick, but fairly stick resistant if used correctly.

"This is a nice guide for cooking for the home chef that does not want to waste a single thing.  It is a cookbook, and more.  Eugenia Bone takes us through the kitchen, from A to Z, apples to zucchinis, with recipes and tips for using the rinds, bones, shells, and peels of the ingredients.The book is beautifully illustrated with color photographs.  Chock full of practical tips on cleaning, shelling, and gutting ingredients such as lobster, asparagus, mushrooms and more, it is a worthwhile read even if you don't use any of the recipes.My only caveat about this book is you would need a lot of time, space in your kitchen, and access to good local ingredients to do what she suggests here.

Becker writes:""Minimalism is the intentional promotion of things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from it.""Clutter is anything you don't need or love.  One of the joys of becoming minimalist is that we are constantly pushed to define what we truly value in life. Instead of 25 mediocre shirts in your closet, have 10 that you truly love and get rid of the restRealize that possessions do not equal joy.Learn to enjoy things without owning them- like parks, museums, etc.Simplify can mean not only removing physical belongings, but deciding what is most important in your life and removing the things that distract you from it.

"McGee is the Infinite Jest of food and cooking.  Exhaustive, at times exhausting, amazing, joyous, and LONG, it is a must-read for aspiring home chefs and professionals alike.  I can't imagine anyone serious about understanding food and cooking not having read this book.  This is a man who truly loves food and the science of it.  It actually reads quite quickly at times and fascinates the reader with many facts, quotes from literature, science lessons and historical excerpts, all about food!  The wine and liquor chapter is also quite compelling.  Where he may lose you is in the hard-core chemistry explanations, which I suspect are thrilling for chemists, but less so for the rest of us.  Also, at one point I asked myself if I really needed to know such excruciating detail for every single fruit every discovered.  But all in all, this is an amazing book which has changed the way I look at food forever.Below are some of my favorite quotes from the book to give you a ""flavor"" for his writing:""I think it's a sad reflection on our civilization that while we can and do measure the temperature in the atmosphere of Venus, we do not know what goes on inside our soufflÃ©s.""""A sip of milk itself or a scoop of ice cream can be a Proustian draft of youth's innocence and energy and possibility, while a morsel of fine cheese is a rich meditation on maturity, the fulfillment of possibility, the way of all flesh.""""Butter and cheese, once prized, delicate concentrates of milk's goodness, have become inexpensive, mass-produced, uninspiring commodities piling up in government warehouses.""""Cheese is one of the great achievements of humankind.""""An egg is the sun's light refracted into life.""""But because we raise meat animals in order to eat them, it seems only just that we try to make their brief lives as satisfying as possible. By fortunate coincidence, the methods of slaughter that result in good-quality meat are also the most humane.""""The sensation of warm, firm, flavorful flesh melting away between tongue and palate is unparalleled.""""Oysters are the sea's most tender morsels, the marine equivalent of penned veal or the fattened chicken, which just sit and eat.""""Plant pigments are one of life's glories! The various greens of forest and field, the purples and yellows and reds of fruits and flower- these color speak to us of vitality, renewal, and the sheer pleasure of sensation.""""Sugar is pure sensation, crystallized pleasure.""""Like all good foods, wine beer and spirits nourish and satisfy the body.""""Sparkling wines delight by emitting bubbles that catch the light and prick the tongue.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NM9ZRQBK49W5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PAAH1W#wasThisHelpful","R2NM9ZRQBK49W5","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At times brilliant, but many times the poems left me flat.This collection of poems starts and ends strong. The first few poems are the best.  They are inventive, creative, engaging and mind-bending.  Then the middle mass of poems felt plain, almost monotonous.The final couple of poems were fantastic.What makes these poems so good is Lockwood's ability to make connections between disparate facts, emotions, ideas and cultural touchstones.  Despite the title, there is very little that is overtly sexual in these poems.  Thought provoking, fresh approach, and when she is at her best, she soars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UX325WH15XTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GAH3R0M#wasThisHelpful","R1UX325WH15XTM","A1G6M86XS35YS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G6M86XS35YS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worth the money.I was skeptical that an expensive pan would make this much difference, as I have been ""cooking"" on cheaper pans for the last few years.  This pan is worth every penny, and changes the way I think about stove-top cooking.  Other than my cast iron, this is my new favorite kitchen pan. I could survive in the kitchen with this and the cast iron alone.First, the pan itself is a thing of beauty.  Wonderfully well-built, smart design, elegant, shiny and solid.  Some people may think it's a bit heavy, but to me, I love it's weight.  It's like a heavy chef knife- wielded properly, the weight allows the pan to do the work for you.Food cooks so evenly on this pan it's amazing.  The copper core allows the pan to get hot extremely quickly, and to cook food through evenly in much less time than cheap pans.  (You can do shrimp on this pan in about 45 seconds).Easy to clean, and I found non issue with even omelettes sticking- obviously you have to use oil or butter.  But I figure I have eaten enough teflon in my lifetime.Less not more.

"Every moment in business happens only once.  With that sentence, Peter Thiel begins Zero to One with the best opening of any business book in memory.  At times he shines with brilliant thoughts, at other times he sounds like a madman, and other times he just sounds silly.  But through all the passion here, there is some truly original thinking.  If you are thinking of doing a start-up, this should be high on your list of required reading.  As an investor, it helped me hone my thinking as well.  And besides that, who doesn't love a book in which the writer compares hipsters to the Unabomber?The way to understand Thiel's unique thought process is to know his favorite question: ""What important truth do very few people agree with you on?""  His answer: most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but he thinks the truth is that technology matters more.This quote is one of my favorites: ""The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.""He deftly explains how monopolists, especially in technology, take pains to pretend that they have a lot of competition, while companies with no real differentiation attempt to do the opposite.  He has strong views; ""monopoly is the condition of every successful business,"" he says.He doesn't love the current educational regime in the United States: ""For the privilege of being turned into conformists, students pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation.""  And another shot: ""All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past.""Thiel relates some business truisms for aspiring entrepreneurs, such as the importance of a sales effort, the power of compounding, the way to determine if you have a niche.  He lays out a seven-point list of success factors for new ventures.He loses his way a little bit 2/3 of the way in this short book when he relates his opinions on hipsters, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga (with pictures!) He even opines that Star Wars is capitalist while Star Trek is communist.  I guess he got a bit tired of writing at some point. I do like his principle of never investing in a tech company that has a CEO that wears a suit, though.With a tidy wrap-up chapter on potential future outcomes for the entire world, this entertaining and informative little volume is done.

The gloves secure with a basic Velcro strap through a buckle which allows the gloves to be easily put on.

"I was skeptical about this product when I first received it.  After using it, I am very happy with the results. Essentially is it a belt that you wrap around your stomach with three gel pads attached.  You control the intensity of the shocks with a remote attached to the belt to force your muscles to contract, simulating a regular abdominal workout.The controller can alter the power of the shocks on the left side and the right side independently from 0 to 99. At higher values, the shocks actually become pretty painful.  I usually never exceeded 80 as it became too unbearable. There are also seven different programs which increase the intensity, frequency of the shocks, and duration of the entire workout. While the controller automatically progresses to more difficult programs after periodic use, I have always manually set my own program. (usually program 3)After using this for about a month, my pants feel light they fit a bit better.  I have not changed anything with eating habits or additional exercise so I attribute all changes to this belt.

"There normally isn't much to say about multi-outlet surge protectors.  They are convenient or almost mandatory for those who need multiple items plugged in simultaneously in a single area.

"We have several different iterations of Monopoly. Most rely on neat aesthetic differences (which we actually really like). Our Futurama set is, by far, our favorite. Now, this Monopoly is significantly different from most other versions. This might be a fun and welcome change for many ... and an annoyance for other. Likewise, the pieces here were not exactly ones that anyone cares to ""fight over."" We just each selected a random landmark ... no one really cared. As far as game play, the passport idea made it distinctly different and gimmicky, but it seemed to translate as exactly that.I think that since we usually just enjoy small alterations (and amusing tokens) and admire the structure of the actual original game, this was not a smash hit for us. However, for a group of teens with no particular experience with this classic game, this has the potential to be a hit (outside of the slightly off-putting tokens ... from the perspective of a teen, of course).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338AHAAJB0GB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THAGEL8#wasThisHelpful","R338AHAAJB0GB4","A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is perfect for everyday use. It is much lighter than our old one, has little cup holders, and remains securely in-place. Now, I do agree that the padding is a little too light for longer journeys. Therefore, we still have our old seat in the other car for vacation trips and those road-trips to visit family. Therefore, other than lacking a bit of luxury (and the price kinda indicates that), it gets you to your destination safely. And, that's the goal.There were no issues with it being compatible with our vehicles or with the child fitting in the seat. Likewise, the aesthetics are fairly nice.A nice choice for most parents.

"This is a nice beginner jump rope for people wanted to add double unders to their workout routine or just want to try it out because of its low price.  The rope in this much like many other speed ropes are a basic corded wire.  However the main difference between this and other pricier ropes lies in the bearings in the handle.  This handle has a rotating head with a hole which the rope goes through so the rope, when spinning, goes only clockwise or counterclockwise.  On other handles, the rope is connected to the handle through a ball bearing which also rests in a rotating head.  This allows you to have less friction no matter what position the rope handles are held.All that said, this is still a great rope for the price and the amount of friction or speed loss will be negligible to all except for those who are serious about double (or triple) unders.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF2TSS43174FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3N05A2#wasThisHelpful","RF2TSS43174FL","A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, I had given up at one point and simply tossed it to the side, but my boyfriend decided to make it ""his goal for the night"" to ""get this thing to work!"" While it did eventually happen, the process was so annoying, so not-at-all-user-friendly, that I couldn't help but feel a little biased against it from the problem-riddled set-up issue.In the end, I guess it is an okay trivia game (we have piles of trivia games without the gimmicky aspect) ... but be prepared for a truly challenging experience in getting this whole thing aligned/synced-up.

"Here's the thing, one of us in this household is a total toner junkie. I mean, two or three times a day. So, this just fueled that passion. Now, here's the thing: if you are accustom to the refreshing feel of toner, refrain from using this too frequently, too quickly (someone regretted that a few days later). It's pretty intuitive that it you go crazy with this (which is so easy, because it feels ""nice""), you skin might become a bit irritated. So, take it easy, limit yourself a bit, and use it in conjunction with the Proactiv line. For us, ultimately, the results were outstanding.

"Foremost, if you use this in moderation (which is where you will get the best results), it is a fantastic product! The scent is light but pleasant, it does not leave skin greasy-feeling, and it does seem to improve skin quality/clarity. (Now, I say ""seem"" only because we have nearly the entire line ... so it can be a little difficult to tell if it is a synergistic effect or if the incredibly positive results are from a single product). Moreover, while it is expensive, I think you might be able to justify it by reminding yourself that it is a nice sized tube, the a ""little goes a long way,"" and that people treat themselves to anti-aging creams for quadruple the price (many of which are considerably less effective and less studied than these fantastic products).This is one of many Proactiv products that truly makes skin ""better.""

"This Proactive product has more pluses than minuses. The biggest ""plus"" is that, like all Proactiv products, it works. However, there are a few drawbacks. Foremost, you will need to clean your razor much more frequently. So, there will be tons of that ""run-it-under-water and *tap* *tap* *tap*"" thing. Additionally, it is crazy expensive. Even if used sparingly, it is super expensive. But, again, when used as a part of the entire line, it makes a world of difference in one's skin. So, for us, it was worth the steep price tag (but I can also, definitely, see why others find it cost-prohibitive).I think the bottom-line here is that it is not a must have, but it is a really nice complement to the overall line. If you have those few extra bucks (or a gift-certificate), I think you will be pleased with this product's overall effect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OW6KOXDPZWZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTCUP7M#wasThisHelpful","R2OW6KOXDPZWZG","A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The material does not stretch, and it is VERY see through- so you'll have to wear a cami under it.  My suggestion is to order up one size.  A 3X probably would have been fine (though loose up top).  The sleeves are great (I'm tall) so if you're short- you may find them too long.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ZMS1TYBA40J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R573288#wasThisHelpful","R30ZMS1TYBA40J","A2OWR2PL3DLWS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OWR2PL3DLWS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These shoes seem quite big to me- both wide and long.  I wear an 11, and usually shoes are tight and too short, but these are LARGE.  I wear big fluffy thorlo socks with them, and then they fit.  Not everyone likes to wear thick socks- so if you don't, these shoes might be a problem.  I don't think the arch support is very good- at least it isn't for me, and it's not a ""soft"" cushioned shoe- but I think they are cute,and quite feminine and I'm willing to put up with the negatives.  I wish I could tell you which size was right for you- but it will totally depend on the size of your foot and the type of sock you wear.  I'd buy the size you normally wear, and a size smaller- just to have both- and then I'd send back the other size.  I ordered a 10 as well- but I felt it was too tight.

"I bought this in 1X and 2X- I'm an 18/20, and never know which will fit (5'9"", pear shape).  For me the 2X was far superior, since it wasn't tight over my butt.  I wanted the tunic to hang loosely- as it does on the model, and I get that with the 2X.  I ordered the white and the blue, but I'm only keeping the blue.  I thought the white was less attractive, in person.  I also worried that with it's long length, if I sat down on something, I'd stain it and ruin it- and since I want this for outside wear, white is probably impractical.  The blue is very bright- it's an electric blue- but it's very flattering.  The arms are long, but not too long for me- however I'm tall.

"This might even run big, if you don't like your sweaters loose.  I normally wear a 2x, but I bought the 1x in this so it would be more form fitting and I could wear it under blazers.  My advice would be- buy your own size and one size smaller, and see what fits your purpose best.  I bought the 2X and then had to go back and buy the 1X, because no one had reviewed this, and I didn't know how they fit.  The knit is not super heavy, the material is of a middle weight and soft and silky.  I washed mine on hand wash in the machine and hung it up to dry and it looks great.  It's an old fashioned style, but very flattering, and it looks fantastic under blazers!  I'm a 42C, and 5'9"" (and normally an 18/20) and I find the 1X is very flattering and form fitting (but not tight!).  It's also a very nice length- most things are too short on me.

"Ok, These are not ""Genuine"" DJI props,  but I run these on my Phantom 1.1.1 when hauling a load and they do very well, it keeps the quad very stable, the props feel flimsy, I don't know how they will do on the phantom 2, but so far they are doing great for me, I run my regular 8045 props when just flying around, etc, because I get much better speed and agility, But when I put my camera on I slap these props on, get a much smoother light and actually longer flying times, and it seems to reduce the heat output on the motors and battery, Just my experience, Experience may vary with others depending on how you have your gains set, etc and what payload you have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCM3JLFHOPLOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVAAW20#wasThisHelpful","RCM3JLFHOPLOV","A1MF9R3SNRA4MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF9R3SNRA4MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical, I fly RC helicopters and one particular helicopter I have burnt out a total of 5 motors so I purchased an aftermarket heatsink for the motor, I tried that for a while but was still burning out motors, So I took a try with this stuff, I put it on the aftermarket heatsink before installing on the motor, I also put some on the oem heatsink/frame and after 3 flights I can tell a BIG difference, It is pulling a LOT more heat off the motor and distributing it on the heatsink and metal frame, For RC applications this is well worth the small investment, and the folks I purchased it from delivered it LIGHTENING quick, I am very happy with this purchase and will most definatley purchase again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MB31JN4OR50D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060N0754#wasThisHelpful","R1MB31JN4OR50D","A1MF9R3SNRA4MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF9R3SNRA4MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I'd like to say, that I love that this came come with instructions, almost EVERYTHING I've ordered when it comes to assembly of my quadcopter di not come with any kind of instruction, This one did, and Good instructions too, I Installed the unit on my Quadcopter, went through calibration and setup, then took it outside, flew great twice, I mean it was beautiful everything was in Sync so good and the copter did'nt have a single twitch in it, so I got two beautiful 12 minute flights out of it, the third day I went out, plugged the quad op, everything went through there calibration sequence, etc.. started throttling up, got about a foot off the ground then it just dropped, luckily I wasnt any higher, the ESC is DEAD, no life whatsoever, The company was great to take care of the situation and refund my money, but I'm going to benchmark this thing and see what the problem is because I love the concept of an all in one and it did run so smoothly, on the occasions it worked :) I'll keep you guys informed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQOLV8IHB1AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQ157MA#wasThisHelpful","RKQOLV8IHB1AJ","A1MF9R3SNRA4MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF9R3SNRA4MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fist off, let me say I am very happy with this purchase, I was a little nervous purchasing something of this scope on Amazon and actually having it delivered by a Tractor Trailer truck to my front door but hey :)  Anyway, After getting and  taking it out of the crate I started the assembly, Be sure to read fully all emails sent to you by the vendor, they include important links to videos to help you assemble this thing, Really it is mostly assembled but this is not a toy, This is a vehicle for on the road use so you need to go over it with a fine tooth comb, be sure to put loc-tite on all the nuts and bolts, check your fuel lines and brackets, etc sometimes these things come loose during shipment, and also check on them from time to time with routine maintenence, Change your oil after your first couple runs, be sure to be easy on the engine for break in period, if you do this and follow those videos you will have yourself I nice scooter that will last a long time, these run good, look good and if maintenenced right they will last forever, They are very simple to work on, there are even upgrades and mods out there, stick some LEDs on it, make it your own..

"ok to start out, you will not be able to fly this thing like you will the 911, of course not this thing is a giant, but it has all it's own qualities.First off, it is very well built, its sturdy as a tank, sometimes a believe god has a strange sense of humor because every time I order a new helicopter it seems to be very windy or storming when it is delivered, I was tired of just sitting there looking at the shear beauty of this beast so I took it out in the heavy wind and started ""learning"" to fly this thing, I crashed it into the house twice, but a couple dings on the canopy but thats about it.. So the moral of the story is, Be patient, wait for a good day to fly this thing, it doesnt do well in heavy wind but of course it does better than the 911.secondly, I love the radio remote, this one is pretty much a hobby grade remote, its a nice one, and it can control the v913, v912, and v911 and I believe a couple of the quads too.for me the purchase was well worth the money, it's keeping from going into withdrawl until I get all of my quadcopter parts in :)***UPDATE 1/20/2014***I've owned this helicopter less than a month, First off (trivial) they sent me a helicopter with a different color canopy than advertised.secondly I love this helicopter, it is fun to fly and is very durable, But I've take 1 star off the overall review (why?) I've owned thishelicopter for less than one month and the main motor has already burnt out. When I fly this chopper I always wait a full 30 minutes beforeI put the battery on the charger, then it takes the battery 1 hour to charge so the motors have a total of 1.5 hours to cool down before thenext flight so that is ample time for the motors to cool down, So I do believe this is a defective motor. I've ordered a replacement motor for itbut I have contacted the seller about this because I believe the parts should last over a month on these, I will update later on what happens.*** 1/21/2014***The Seller (DealMeDeal) has contacted me and Said they would ship me another Main motor, Excellent!

" 2:11 MinsThis is a great flying little quad, although it has been fairly windy since this has been delivered I have still enjoyed it, it does fair in light wind but it is a very light little machine and a gust of wind will pick it up and carry it away fairly quickly, It's a tough little bird though, I hung it up in a tree yesterday and instead of freaking out I looked and saw how it was hooked to the tree then I flew it right off the branch fairly easily, then instead of getting hung up even further up the tree I let it fall the rest of the way down, it smacked just about every branch on the way down and really don't even have a scratch on it.The camera is a fairly decent little camera although I upgraded the MicroSD card fairly quickly, the 1gig card fills up pretty quick. I use a USB cable to copy the video files to my computer instead of taking the SD out every time I'm sure taking the card in and out so much will wear it out fairly quick.The remote is great, it feels comfortable in hand and has digital trim settings and a digital readout showing throttle setting, remote battery life, trim settings, camera settings, etc, it also has the 360 inversion button you can tap to make the quad do flips, be sure to have some altitude before doing this a be ready to hit the throttle again to keep the quad from hitting the ground, you can also use the top left button for this, press it and when it starts beeping you can tap you rudder controls up, down, left, or right ta make it flip in the direction you like, this is a little more fun than just the 360 inversion.Other than that there is not much more I can say about this Quad other than I love it, I do plan on building my own quad in the future and this is giving me some great training on the physics of a quad and how to fly one.Let me add that some proper care an manteinence of your LiPO batteries will make them last long, There are many videos on Youtube on proper care of your batteries but here are some tips.* Your batteries will come from the factory charged, but not fully, Charge them fully before flying.* Do not run your battery down all the way, leave about 20% power in the battery, you can purchase voltage alarms that will buzz at a specified  voltage.* after flying wait about 15 minutes for battery to cool down before re-charging.* when putting batteries up for storage do not fully charge them, charge them about 80%.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U35TPJ4N0PSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3IN11Q#wasThisHelpful","R3U35TPJ4N0PSD","A1MF9R3SNRA4MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF9R3SNRA4MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The headline just about sums it up!, The Syma S107 line of choppers are great!. They are fun to fly and are priced great. I have an S107C and had to get these s107gs for my nephew for Christmas, Of course I had to try them out, They fly great!, I recommend getting the 240mah upgraded battery for even more fun, check out my review for it for more info.When getting your chopper be sure to put it on the charger and charger it until the red light goes off, after that you're ready to fly, A full charge will get you a good 5 minutes flying time then let it cool about 10 minutes before putting it back on the charger and charge fully before going again. I enjoy the S107 line of choppers and I'm sure you will too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8Q3ZG6ZVDAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8499000606#wasThisHelpful","RB8Q3ZG6ZVDAI","A1MF9R3SNRA4MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF9R3SNRA4MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:58 MinsGreat Little chopper, the camera in mine was very fragile, every time I would crash the chopper the camera would pop off the connector in the housing, so I opened the camera housing up and folded a little tiny peice of electrical tape up and put it on the chip then when closing the camera housing back up it helps hold the camera fitting into the circuit board, Be sure to let battery cool down for about 10-15 minutes before charging, when you plug the charger into the USB port their will be a red light on showing that it is ready to charge, Plug the chopper in and the red light will shut off meaning it is charging, when it is fully charged the red light will come back on. do not fly the chopper but about 5 minutes, do not run the battery completly empty before charging again and you should not have any problems, I can fly the chopper a lot easier by adjusting the trim before taking off, put it on either a wood floor or some flat surface and start the rotors up but do not take off, then use the trim control on the top right side of the remote to adjust the trim until the chopper stays straight, then you can put more effort into the throttle to start flying, it will fly very straight then.

"This by far has to be the best purchase and upgrade I have my for my Syma S107C, The chopper is much more responsive now and the fly time is much longer, I just flew this thing with the camera on for a full 8 minutes and there was enough juice left in the battery I'm sure for at least 1 or two more minutes, I can now pinpoint my landings and fly this thing very precisely because of the extra power gained through this upgrade, The installation went fairly easy, I de-soldered the old battery from the wires and soldered the new battery to it but you could always probably just splice the wires in, It was hard getting the canopy to fit back over the new larger battery, but after finessing it went on, this battery did come with a little charge on it but I stuck it on the charger anyway to be safe and it took about thirty minutes to charge. the battery was shipped quickly and at a price like this you would be stupid not to but this upgrade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NTZS69H4DEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MQ7QV0#wasThisHelpful","R6NTZS69H4DEH","A1MF9R3SNRA4MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF9R3SNRA4MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It gives an insight into the matriarch of a wealthy Chinese family in the early 1900s (I think) and how she rules her family with wisdom.  It is a large household since all the wives of her sons and all their children plus all the servants live in the same household under her rule.  When she turns 40 she decides that her sexual life is finished (no explicit sex - everything is simply hinted at) and she decides to bring in a concubine for her husband.

I usually buy another brand of fly trap but since this one got so many good recommendations on Amazon I decided to try it.  It came quickly and was easy to set up and seems to be attracting lots of flies.  It hangs by a loop which is fine if you have a nail or something but since I wanted to hang the two I bought on tree branches on the patio I had to find something to hang them with.  And I had to be careful because I sure didn't want all that smelly stuff to spill!  I recommend they include a tie on or wire to hang it.

"This course is a very practical and comprehensive introduction to Microsoft Access 2013.  It is designed for three different types of users: #1 - The user who has worked with previous versions and Access and now wants to take advantage of the new features of 2013.  I think the options to use touch screen and also the ability to build web apps are the best features but it also goes over all the interface changes in Office 2013#2 â Someone who has used other databases/programming languages â like SQL, FoxPro, Visual Basic, Excel, etc. â and now wants to work with Access 2013#3 â The user who is new to database design (these last types of users will have to work very hard to understand everything but be patient as he carefully explains everything and you will learn a great deal).As you can imagine writing a course that will be helpful to such a diverse group is not easy but I think this course does it quite well.  If you are an experienced user you might find the beginning classes slow but be patient as you will never regret learning the correct way to do things in Office/Access 2013 and the many options to do them different ways.  It would take ages of trial and error to figure all of this out.  If you are not completely familiar with Office 2013 it is easy to get lost about where you are but he goes over the âribbonâ and all the options in great detail.  Even if you are experienced, you wonât be sorry you sat through all of this.I wondered how he would approach database design without losing the beginners but he jumps right in.  His database is small, somewhat simple but quite a few tables with crosstabs and cross reference tables and insights into data types, etc.  Beginners will have to take this part slowly but he makes it quite possible to learn it if you follow closely and do all the assigned lessons.  (Experienced users will probably prefer to practice on their own databases and not the assigned ones but it is important to practice or test as you go along since you will never remember as much as you think you will!)  He covers database design, keys, relationships, normalization, indexes etc. and shows you how to use the data in datasheet form.  For a beginner getting all the properties correct will take some attention but he does it all with great detail and with practice.  He shows you how to add list boxes and/or validations to fields, etc. and how to navigate, sort and search the records.Then he goes to SQL and gives a nice introduction.  I am new to Access but experienced in SQL so I was looking forward to using Access SQL.  It is different from standard Microsoft SQL but it has wonderful wizards that build any query for you and then you can look at what it built and see how this SQL works so that you can build your own queries as needed.  Access offers wizards to build queries of all types â UPDATE, DELETE, searches for blank fields, searches for duplicate records, etc.  Once you use the wizard you can see the SQL statement itself and build on that for the future.  (I thought the Access SQL Statement to update one table from another - a straightforward statement in the conventional SQL I am familiar with - was mind boggling,  but it makes sense and now I know how it wants it done.)  Those wizards can be quite helpful.He then spends quite a few lessons on forms.  There are so many different ways to approach them.  Access has a lot of wizards that build forms in different ways from the simple to the complex.  Once you see what it does you can easily go on from there to build much more complex ones.  The possibilities are almost infinite and he tries to touch on many types of objects from combo boxes, to text boxes to command buttons.  Again, for beginners, do the assignments and for the experienced, work on your own app trying to use what he taught because you will forget it otherwise.He also spends time on reports and Access is wonderfully helpful here allowing both beginners and experienced programmers many options.When it comes to the most complicated issues like macros and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications â Accessâs programming language) he can only give a brief overview.  Once you get to this point if you want to go more deeply into VBA, you need to get books on that (Amazon has a number of new ones that seem comprehensive).He also lightly touches on data conversion â from Excel tables or text files or ODBC  or SQL (of particular interest to me as I had old data to pull in) and on setting up your app for users and how to handle things like security.All in all I found this to be a very comprehensive and useful course.  Iâll never regret sitting through the parts I thought I already knew because I got some insights.  It will be useful to users of all types if they are careful to pay attention and practice what is new to them.  I highly recommend this course.Footnote:  The nice thing about Access is that it comes with Microsoft Office and has a comparatively small footprint which makes it easier than keeping the big programming engines like SQL, Oracle, .NET, C++, C## on your system if you donât need the complexity of the more powerful languages and databases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HC7144XMAPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGRG5ZE#wasThisHelpful","R12HC7144XMAPY","AJLPS4A9HGOQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLPS4A9HGOQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to praise these little tablets as they have worked wonders for me.  I have a dry cough that badly interrupts my sleep.  My doctors say it is related to sinus/polyps issues and the treatments have either not worked or only worked for a few weeks (polyps grow back whether treated with surgery or steroids).  So for the last 10-15 years I have had to sleep with lozenges in my mouth all night.  Of course, there is a danger of aspiration but it was the only way to get sleep.  Recently I stumbled across these OraMoist tabs â they are wonderful.  The little tablet sticks to the roof of your mouth and keeps your mouth moist for many hours as it dissolves.  One or two gets me through the whole night.  I just love them.I tried other brands but like OraMoist best as they last much longer.  Also some of the others do not stick on the roof of your mouth but on a tooth (yuck!) or the side of the mouth.  I much prefer OraMoist and highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKZ09Y27AA6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JC9FKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NKZ09Y27AA6O","AJLPS4A9HGOQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLPS4A9HGOQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free item to review.I'm an 11 1/2 extra-wide. I tried a pair of the gel pads in the exercise sneakers I wear on a treadmill 5-6 days a week. I've gotten blisters and callouses around my heels over the years from ill-fitting/worn sneakers and have used a number of homebrew remedies to add extra padding and comfort - some more successful than others.These gel pads add perhaps a quarter inch of support at the back end and thin out to about 1/16"" at the front, which isn't much. But on an inclined treadmill even that much is noticeable and does relieve some of the tension on my ankles.If only they were about 3/8"" wider on both sides they would really fit snug and secure. The adhesive sticks well initially but, I suspect over time with a lot of sweat and movement, the pads are going to gravitate to one side and begin to feel awkward. I know my tolerance if I have to start adjusting them before each run and I'll just end up yanking them.But that hasn't yet happened in the couple of weeks I've used them so for now I'm satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFEVBKKUEWV9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZASCOZQ#wasThisHelpful","RFEVBKKUEWV9E","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.Great for taking the dog out in the dark winter months. Unlike the flat-faced LED headlamps, this one has an adjustable beam focus that nicely  narrows and diffuses - making it doubly useful for reading during blackouts (my inevitable pastime), or in cars where an overhead light would distract the driver (or won't reach the back seat). I have a forced air blower in the attic and strapping this lamp on will make changing filters up there a lot easier than crawling around (and propping up) with a hand-held flashlight.There's plenty of headroom in the straps and a wide range of adjustment to fit any head size. The switch button protrudes nicely, making it easy to grab and press without looking. It's the standard two-levels of brightness plus a strobe and the bright setting is more than adequate for my use (still waiting for that big retro-party to whip out the strobe!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNB5HGV3GBPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNB5HGV3GBPD","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.This is not a fancy, heavy-weight leather belt by any means. But I like the 'non-shiny' matte black, the double-row stitching, and the 1 1/2"" width.It's got some weight to it; it's not one of those old-fashioned 'cardboard belts' I doubt anyone wears anymore. It's reasonably solid, the kind of belt I'd wear with casual pants including other-than-blue jeans and khakis. The buckle has a nice gunmetal shine to it, with the roller, and the latch is comfortably loose making it easy to set.The inside doesn't even pretend to be fake leather, it's tightly woven poly-whatever, but it's just as matte-black and actually quite comfortable and easy to slide over a variety of pants materials.Bottom line: A good utilitarian belt to have in your collection for casual use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32OF1FJFDMSVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R96SMM#wasThisHelpful","R32OF1FJFDMSVL","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.The 'infinity' part is the large loop form of the scarf - kind of zen. It's hard to measure precisely with stretchy material but it's perhaps 2-3 feet in diameter. You toss it once over your head, then twist and loop again, fitting it snugly around your neck. You can also pull it up into a convenient hood. The beauty of the loop design is the scarf can't unravel and fall off or worse - no 'Isadora Duncan' moments (look it up).The material is definitely heavier than ultra-light synthetic scarfs that can feel like cotton candy in the breeze. But it's not as thick as the heavy wool you get on say classic Irish sweaters. It also has a open weave, sort of a tight macramÃ© texture that's more apparent as you stretch. It's not yet deep winter around here but I suspect it'll provide adequate protection outdoors. And if you keep your house 'less than toasty' or heat only one  zone, it's a handy thing to throw on to keep warm in colder rooms.Bottom Line: Attractive color and texture.

"I received a free item to review.I'm a lefty and, without thinking about it much, I tend to sling backpacks and shoulder bags over my right shoulder and hold them on that side to keep my left arm free. Unfortunately the lower side strap on this bag attaches on the wrong side for me. Obviously I can still secure the pack with the large center strap but it lacks the extra support the pack is designed to deliver. It's a shame they didn't make the lower strap attachable on either side - doesn't seem like an expensive proposition or technical difficulty.Other than that, it's a good bag to store 'wet' (as in workout or beach) towels and clothing. Not an excessive number of compartments and zippers to deal with, for those who prefer simple and functional. The zipper pull is comfortable but the pack material sits very close to the track and got caught a couple of times I pulled. The yoga mat straps can be tightened enough not to worry my mat will slide out.The top handle is nicely designed and comfortable - some backpack manufacturers ignore or miss that many customers spend more time hand-carrying their products than back-carrying and they give too little thought to the balance and comfort of the top handles.Bottom Line: Attractive and durable enough, although I wouldn't use it for heavy-duty loads or items with sharp/jagged edges that might puncture the lining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3GKJ6V88K76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BPXOQ#wasThisHelpful","RD3GKJ6V88K76","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free item to review.I suppose it's a double-edged sword: you want cycling accessories to be lightweight, but you want them to be rugged as well to withstand active use, drops, and normal 'banging around'. However both the plastic lenses and frame of these glasses are so lightweight I consider the case and lens pouch pretty much a necessity.For my head size the glasses are barely wearable and not especially comfortable. The all-plastic frame hinges aren't very smooth-operating and have no spring to them. Beyond the maximum opening the frame easily begins to bend - particularly at the center bridge point where it's most likely to snap. The nose bridge is too narrow which keeps the glasses from sitting snug - mine would require constant straightening were I moving my head around a lot in outdoor activities.The lenses themselves scuff easily when dropped on pavement (I tried and confirmed it) and I don't understand the point of the openings along the top edge corners: Is that some kind of vent/air circulation thing? I think they're ugly viewed up close and, at particular angles to light sources, definitely allow light to enter and be reflected on the inner frame.Bottom line: These glasses are purely functional if you need a pair in a pinch, but I wouldn't be satisfied with the workmanship at this price.

"This is essentially a syllabus designed for Schoenberg's American composition classes. It contains original examples 'in the style of' early 19th century piano pieces. The pedagogy begins simply: expressing the pitches of a single harmony, and builds logically, gradually, to multiple harmonies, motif forms, sentences, periods, contrasting middle sections. The goals are to train the ear to compose in small forms such as minuet and scherzo.'Models' is a relatively short book (though dense with examples) and the explanations are on the terse side - or rather they presume Schoenberg is there in the classroom to expound in more detail. If you're unfamiliar with his methodology, I strongly recommend working with 'Fundamentals of Musical Composition' at the same time. That text explains these ideas in more depth, particularly 'developing variation', the core driving force in Schoenberg's concept of tonal composition. Instead of original examples as in 'Models', 'Fundamentals' draws heavily upon Beethoven (mostly piano sonatas and string quartets) as well as other late 18th and 19th century composers.Combined with studying Schoenberg's Harmony and (if you can find it) his Preliminary Exercises in Counterpoint, you've got a pretty solid grounding in tonal composition leading into the early 20th century - ironically coming from a musician many people would least expect, but who was adamant that his own music, no matter how radical it appeared to some, was in fact grounded in and the logical successor to a musical tradition he very much respected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODQIDDO2BP7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007E2BRY#wasThisHelpful","R2ODQIDDO2BP7T","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 'classic' modern foot stool has taken a beating in recent decades as general awareness of musicians' injuries and overall 'body wellness' has become an issue in pedagogy - not just for the guitar, but for all instruments.I'm not knocking the perspective and the awareness - I've benefited greatly from it. I suffered lower back pain and excess tension as a result of a too-high foot stool for years - in the mistaken belief 'one size fits all' and if <insert famous player's name here> uses it this way, who am I to argue.Well, I'm now a firm believer that one size or approach does not fit all when it comes to positioning the instrument. You really should take into account the length of your legs versus your torso, thighs versus the entire leg, your arm lengths, how the instrument contacts your 'lap', the angle of the soundboard to the floor as well as the neck angle to both the floor and your body's 'front plane' - not to mention the height and positioning of the chair you're using and the position of the foot stool on the floor versus an imaginary center line from your body as well as the inside angle of your knee joint.Lot's of things to consider and experiment with to arrive at a comfortable and appropriate position for the foot stool - and I won't deny that for some people the answer may be not to use one. For myself I set the stool to its lowest possible height and, taking everything else into account, I play more comfortably today than ever before - and I've played for over 40 years.A little 'tricking out' of my own is to contact cement a matching piece of short pile carpet over the top of the stool. The softer feel is especially welcome playing at home in socks.If you're not sure the foot stool is for you, it's certainly cheaper than the Shearer Strap to try out. The strap is an interesting alternative for classical - I also play steel string and electric and have nothing against using one (although drilling an eyehook on the neck of my nylon string as one Shearer recommended option does make me cringe a bit). I'd first experiment with 'temporary' applications using Velcro tape or even go the traditional steel string end strap pin with a 'tie-on' neck end before I put holes in the neck - especially if you have a valuable instrument you might sell down the line.(BTW, for those inclined, hiding small pin holes can be accomplished with a combination of filler, stain, lacquer and/or poly/super glue.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBS6P14CI85J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CD1R7K#wasThisHelpful","R1OBS6P14CI85J","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.If you have a desktop (musical) keyboard and need a more substantial music stand than the lightweights that often come built-in, the angle/height options this portable desk provides work really well. I took off the fans and mouse platform and widened the shelf by attaching a strip of 1/4"" thick birch plywood. I also use it, in a more intended way, for an old laptop I use strictly to display printed music.If you draw or paint, the desk can be fashioned into a convenient easel you can prop a drawing pad or small canvas against.The large push buttons that free the joints are easy to operate and the legs feel absolutely secure when locked - there's no slop in them at all.Personally, the metal desktop is a little 'rough' to use in bed, but if you like to 'slouch on a couch' this works well (also makes a handy meal tray!).I built a homebrew version years ago that didn't work nearly as well.

"I think the most valuable part of the book is the measure-by-measure bowing instructions for each of the dozen or so Beginner Songs in chapter 6, many of which are of Suzuki book 1 caliber. When studied in combination with the video demonstrations on DVD you get a real sense of how to distribute bow length across musical phrases and the effect of bow speed on volume.These devices become more refined as you grow in ability and are essential parts of a violinist's toolkit of expression as you study more involved pieces. But I found this book to be an excellent application of the concepts, giving immediate and satisfying results.If you're self-teaching and reach the point of bringing both hands together functionally, bow distribution is one of the most challenging aspects of violin playing - particularly when you're starting out and also trying to focus on tone production, reading, and keeping time.It's something that's too often taken for granted or outright ignored in early level learning material - and that's a shame because providing clarity on the mechanics of using the bow length makes it easier - not more difficult - to integrate more 'ear and feel' concerns such as tone and time. Worrying about 'running out of bow' and slowing down to conserve length is self-defeating musically and can sabotage a playing experience that requires relaxed focus.I'm less enthusiastic about some of the other material in the book: Seidel teaches dropping the elbow when approaching the frog from the midpoint square - something I personally disagree with and feel contributes to bow bounce and uneven tone. The best book on pure violin playing mechanics (no music) I've come across for self-learners is Mark Rush's 'Playing the Violin'. It's essentially Galamian's approach with many more and much better pictures. A little pricey but well-worth it.But this book's chapter on bow distribution applied clearly to beginning pieces alone makes it worth getting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXONN8S1PH1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598634488#wasThisHelpful","R2RXONN8S1PH1J","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free item to review.I play classical guitar and Iâm fussy about the nails on my plucking hand. Contour, edge, and smoothness have a huge influence on tone. Many guitarists, being a superstitious lot with a fondness for ritual, use some combination of files followed by a buffing surface (A teacher once recommended sprinkling dental pumice as a buffing agent â a little messy for dark clothes).  I actually use a 1 ½ inch smooth pebble to buff â I discovered it by chance and it works for me.My immediate reaction to this portable trimmer/filer was, âNo way am I sticking my nails into some electric cheese grater to be torn offâ. But I was pleasantly surprised by how finely-calibrated the action is. Itâs not a fast, aggressive cut like sticking your nails on a bench sander. Itâs easy to work the tool left to right, following the contour you want.I have pretty large hands and âsausage fingersâ yet had no trouble covering the full contour of even my thumbnail.  Nail corners are especially problematic and can catch strings if not shaped properly.  I was able to take my time and work those corners the way I like.As far as I can tell, the only difference between âtrimâ and âfileâ modes are the trim has a somewhat more aggressive cut, but itâs easy to control.I expected a coarse edge left in either mode and was surprised at how smooth the results were. Granted, not quite smooth enough to do without buffing, but most people might not bother.On the down side, the vibration felt in the finger tip is somewhat âchalk on a blackboardâ tingly and, depending on your tolerance, may or may not be a problem. The high-pitch whirr of the trimmer will no doubt scare the heck out of anyone watching and is loud enough to be disturbing if youâre in public in close quarters.  And finally, depending on your current technique, you just may find it faster and more focused to pull out a file.In case anyoneâs wondering, the opening is too narrow to use with pet claws â at least with my dogâs.Bottom Line: the filer/trimmer works better than I suspected and thereâs really no risk of rapidly grinding your nails off!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQMWINZHJBPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01576R4XC#wasThisHelpful","R2RQMWINZHJBPI","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.I put the bulb in my garage door opener, where it's diffused by the white translucent cover. It's slightly less bright than the ordinary 60W bulb on the other side, so I'd rate it as a 40W equivalent. The bulb itself is clear and I find the light too harsh for an exposed lamp fixture, but it's fine diffused. I don't detect an unusual amount of heat coming off it either.I go through a lot of bulbs in the opener because it's programmed to keep them on for 5 minutes every time the door moves.

"I received a free item to review.The cover is microfiber plush with some 'grain' to it, meaning your hand will feel smoother in one direction while raising the short fabric 'hairs' in the other. The texture is fairly attractive and there's about an inch of squeeze/give to it. The gray is, well, neutral but should work with most car interiors and many indoor chairs.It appears they went for less-weight versus stability, The circular frame of the seat and the rotating base are made of heavy-enough plastic not to worry about cracking, but the price for the lighter-weight is the rotation is not as smooth as I'd like and there's an annoying plastic-on-plastic sound that doesn't add up to a secure feeling.I play violin seated and I modified an old piano bench into a practice chair. I need fairly firm support but there's a lot of incidental reaching and motion while turning music pages, reaching for accessories, digital recorder, putting the instrument down, etc. I thought such a cushion would add some flexibility and comfort without risking straining my lower back muscles.I have to say the swivel seat does improve the situation, but it's not as secure or as comfortable as I'd like and I worry it'll get even less so over time.Bottom Line: I'll use the cushion it for now but keep searching for something better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJFWFX4IMGF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131EJ90I#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJFWFX4IMGF9","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.Best I can tell with my radius gauges the contact surface is a 12"". The rubber surface has enough give to make that fine for all but very arched electric necks (i.e. 50's Fender). I can use it on my Martin OM-1, which has a 16"" radius, because I generally play with a light touch for both flat and finger picking. I also used the capo successfully on my classical - I capo at the third fret and tune the G to F# for lute music - the shorter scale length gives a more appropriate response and feel.If you play hard with a flatter radius neck this capo may buzz on you - you're better off using one designed for a classical neck.Compared to the Planet Waves design, the frame of the Furios capo is definitely lighter and the back handle feels thinner though no less stiff. This is a plus for me as I like a capo to feel and look as unobtrusive as possible - I remember using those 'wrought iron fence' Kaysers that were anything but unobtrusive and easy to apply, although they held quite well at the time.The main shortcoming of the Furios capo is the spring has no tension adjustment. I don't think there's any real danger of compressing neck wood. But the spring action itself is stiffer and less smooth than the Planet Waves. If you're someone with a dedicated instrument and keep the capo on all the time, this probably doesn't matter. But if you change a lot the stiffer tension can be annoying or worse - if you've ever gotten a hand cramp onstage you know what I'm talking about.The neck-side rubber has a half-ribbed design which I don't think has much value for guitar necks but better holds narrower banjo and mandolin necks (I play both but have never capo'd a mandolin).Bottom Line: In a pinch the Furios is a adequate, lightweight capo. If you're always misplacing them like me, you can't have too many. But I prefer a Schubb for my steel string and my classical gauge Planet Waves model - both are easier on the hands and work fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGQTT8W81378/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LBQLYK#wasThisHelpful","R2GGQTT8W81378","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.Job One of course is, is the square 'square' and, comparing it with both my carpenter's and speed squares, it looks good - for everyday woodworking - you're not going to use this for precision machining.I do a lot of hand drilling and sawing of small work pieces and I like to use a level or speed square as an eyeball guide to stay perpendicular to the work surface. Keeping the guide steady can be a challenge but the 1 1/8"" width of this square sits well. The 'rubberized' surface is just barely - I wish it were a bit heavier and 'non-skid'. But I guess the thinner, harder surface will stay a bit more true over time and, if you saw with it, you're less likely to take bits and chunks out.The pencil holder/sharpener feature doesn't add much value for me and I don't like that it obstructs lying the long surface flat. I think it could have been better incorporated into the sides. I cut off the holder loop to make the edge flush. I use a marking knife when I can but when I use pencils I either use a carpenter's pencil sharpened with a knife or an electric pencil sharpener. I don't like the cut of the embedded sharpener.Having a metric/imperial tape is very handy if you constantly work in both, as I do. I especially like that the tape tip sits well below flush and doesn't interfere with the corner surfaces at all. The push lock button has just the right amount of 'stick' and resistance - no worry it'll move without you.Bottom Line: If you're like me that pencil-erasable white writing surface will quickly fill up with 'non-erasable' pen measurements, phone numbers, etc. But I appreciate the thought!A decently-made, useful square to keep around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9WORB9C6FVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S6EVU6#wasThisHelpful","R2F9WORB9C6FVX","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.The bowls have a firm but 'rubbery' texture; they're easy to expand and collapse by holding the rims with both hands and pressing with your thumbs. The 'ribs' in the sides don't have deep crevices that might catch food and make them hard to clean.

"I received a free item to review.I never thought about having that secondary large handle loop at the pet end of a leash before - what a great idea. I'm old school and still prefer heavy leather leashes, but I use synthetics for wet weather, in the car, etc.We have a yellow lab who's thankfully not aggressive, but she's jumpy and excitable - especially when close up with new people and other large dogs.  Even with a 4-5 ft leash she can be two-handfuls until she calms down. The leverage I get from the loop on this leash really makes a difference; I feel much more in control and less likely to abraid my hand from grasping wildly at a taut and tangled leash.The synthetic material is quite heavy all-around and especially at the tied ends. This isn't one of those cheap thin leashes you have to worry about a dog shredding or gnawing through. Another advantage of the synthetic is it's easy to clean and there's no smell (for those not crazy about the scent of wet, worn leather - which I happen to love).The collar hook is what I'd call medium-heavy - much better than some lightweight hollow metal hooks I've encountered, but not quite the heavy solid nickel-steel hooks I remember from years ago. These are what you'll find on good quality leashes these days; the spring is plenty tight and unlikely to give way, no matter how active the dog.Bottom Line: The red is really bold, attractive, and doesn't look like it's going to fade anytime soon. Really good quality and that second handle is something I'm afraid I'll get use to and decide it's worth retiring my classic leather leashes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRV77IROV22XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI1ZN9G#wasThisHelpful","RRV77IROV22XH","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the 'straight-in-the-ear' design for ease of insertion and quick removal at work (as in 'Sorry, what was that again?'). But the backs do protrude more than other designs and there's uncomfortable pressure while wearing large ear muffs - which I do while mowing and blowing snow.The cord gauge is a little heavier than other buds I have and longer (about 4ft) - both of which I like. I find flat ribbon cords tangle less easily than regular round cables but in this case the heavier gauge helps.Sound is so subjective the only way I know to evaluate earphones is to A/B them with other pairs using comparable sound sources:I found the Panasonic drops 360 has by far the strongest bass and overall warmth and signal strength than either my Bose SoundTrue Ultra or Brainwavz phones.There's a fair amount of depth in the response of the drops360 as well. The Bose, on the other hand, has a flatter, more evenly-balanced response, with more clarity and definition. For music with a wide frequency span and quite a few instrument/vocal sources, clarity is often more desirable than sheer bottom end.But in the several reference recordings I used (orchestral, small group jazz, acoustic solo instruments, chorus) I was very impressed by these Panasonic phones. I'm a musician and for more 'analytical' listening I might prefer the clarity of the Bose. But for sheer pleasure listening the drops360 is an unexpected surprise.(I have to say, the Brainwavz, which I'd previously considered quite good really showed its limitations against the other pairs, in terms of overall sound quality.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29M6789QNSRAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMVLY7C#wasThisHelpful","R29M6789QNSRAR","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm not going to quantify duration, measure the lamp output, or trust the specs. I simply would not recommend using them where a baby or small child is likely to become fascinated and be drawn to them.That aside, plug the card into a full-size powered USB port and the light is directed to the USB 'up' side. The juice from my phone charger drives them quite nicely.There's no on-board battery but you can dig up one of those portable USB power supplies you've got lying around and you've got a truly portable little lamp.

"The centerpieces of this collection are Turtledoveâs 100 page Hugo-winning novella âDown In The Bottomlandsâ along with the 50 page âHoxbombâ  â just an upfront for anyone who prefers their short stories exclusively short.Turtledoveâs a historian by training and he explains in a thoughtful essay on writing alt history how it helps lend credibility. Heâs a stickler for accuracy â or accurate plausibility â and doesnât abide sloppy mismatches of events and details.While heâs best-known for alt-history, Turtledoveâs no one-trick pony: His stories reveal broad interests and writing chops suitable for any context: a super sharp eye and ear for detail, human nature, and dialog, a great sense of humor, and an intellect that never condescends to readers, doesnât feel too clever by half, or consumed by cynicism.Heâll occasionally step outside the story frame and wink at you, but itâs always in good fun and never enough to distract from Job One â effective storytelling.If thereâs one criticism I have itâs that Turtledoveâs characters are so well done and his scene painting so vivid it sometimes comes at the expense of pacing and drama. I found âDown In The Bottomlandsâ for example extremely slow going at first before an unexpected murder âlivened things upâ and announced there was more than a far-future travelogue intended here.The introductions to each piece in âWe Installâ run from a several sentences to a few paragraphs and the one-time aspiring writer in me (arenât we all?) found them fascinating. Itâs illuminating and instructional to see how a seasoned writer can mine story inspiration in an offhand comment, magazine article, or some combination of current events.For example, the title piece in âWe Installâ is a brief story inspired by an actual solicitation to install a home solar energy system and Turtledoveâs daughterâs amusement at the pun.For pros like Turtledove itâs not necessary to retire to some exotic locale, exclusive arts colony, or ritual inner sanctum to get work done. I have the feeling he can crank out a story sitting in a dentist office â and the setting will work its way in somehow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9TSF5SAL21X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504009428#wasThisHelpful","R2I9TSF5SAL21X","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd have to go back to Scofield's 'Enja Period' to find as consistently rich, song-form blowing as on 'Past Present'. It's great hearing him dig in so much in what, I think, is his most comfortable, 'home-base' setting: the trio + sax.  The recorded guitar tone is gorgeous - upfront and warm, with plenty of 'amp' and plenty of percussive undertone (pick feel) that I haven't enjoyed so much since the 'Works For Me' record. Scofield likes to feel some string resistance and tends to pick closer to the bridge, which gives his legato phrasing clarity and definition. There's nothing flabby or 'glissy/ghosty' about his playing - the notes speak, picked or slurred.Scofield remains a underrated jazz composer with as pure a melodic sense as you'll come across in any genre. He's that uncommon guitarist whose tunes rarely descend into guitar-cliches. Double-stops may evoke harmonic stabs and bent notes vocal and horn expression, but it never feels like it's about the guitar, always about the music and the interaction of the musicians. A deceptively complex sense of form and harmony make his tunes great fun (and educational) to study and play.With so much writing under his belt it's natural to hear echoes of tunes-past on 'Past Present'. But if like me you're as much a fan of his writing as his playing, you won't mind at all.Sad to read about his son's passing in the notes (I'm pretty sure I stood next to the young man at a gig in upstate NY several years back attended by Scofield's parents as well). It's a very poignant gesture to use his son's words to name the project and tunes.Scofield can be such a musical chameleon - and he rarely disappoints - but I hope he sticks around for awhile in this particular incarnation. I go back to his days with Galper and the trio with Swallow and Nussbaum. And I think, without a doubt, 'Past Present' is as good as anything he's done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZZ9SDXDIUPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HOEMV4#wasThisHelpful","R3HZZ9SDXDIUPY","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free item to review.Three of them, actually (they make great gifts for people without refrigerator built-ins, or who entertain a lot).The difference between the three models of Ivation portable mini-icemaker comes down to the number of ice cube sizes each can produce (1, 2, or 3), the relative size of the compartment lid, the control panel and its orientation (top or front-facing), and the overall size/style of the unit.The compressor, capacity, and operation of the three models are essentially the same. I went into more detail in my review of the 3-sizes-of-cubes model so Iâm just going to recap here:This particular model produces only one size of ice cube. My fridge built-in only makes one-size and I've never thought it a problem. The size corresponds to the 'large' size of the two-size model and the 'medium' size of the three-size model.The ice cubes are shaped like hollowed-out rounded cones, not the semi-circular solids many refrigerator built-ins produce nor the classic cube shape you get with freezer trays.It takes just over a 6-cup Brita pitcher-full of water to fill the icemaker to the max indicator. The compartment lid stays open by itself so pouring is comfortable.It takes about two hours to make cubes using just about all of the water. All three units will simply detect and go into standby when the basket is full so thereâs no worry about overflow. I emptied the basket twice, the first time at about the one hour mark.All three icemaker models are very easy to operate and donât produce excessive noise. The three-cube model has a somewhat more complex control panel with a standby/pause function and auto on/off timer. It also provides a bit more feedback in the form of troubleshooting icons.This one-sized cube models is probably the simplest to operate and I think the appearance of the control panels is more attractive than the one on the three size model.All three models use the same drain plug mechanism and are easy to position over a sink.Bottom Line: All three icemaker models are well-made and attractive â although all are too large to keep permanently on our countertop. The hollow cone-shaped cubes are an acquired taste but if you entertain a lot and need to crank out more ice than the fridge can handle (or you donât have a built-in), itâs a handy and easy-to-use addition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351PW34RWZCG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKCTAHM#wasThisHelpful","R351PW34RWZCG7","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free item to review.A lot of so-called athletic/exercise headphones claim to be sweat-resistant  but  the reality is their thin cords, lightweight and exposed cushions and controls  start to break down  -or get smelly-funky â fast, especially in warmer weather.The connecting band on these wireless phones is short and relatively stiff â with the kind of hard plastic coating I can easily wipe-down after a workout and clean with paper towel and a small dab of detergent.The Bluetooth pairing and functioning is fine with my Samsung Android phone. The sound quality is not as good as phones I use for âserious listeningâ but itâs more than adequate for exercising where thereâs a lot of background noise from my treadmill - and Iâll take durability over less than top-shelf sound for this purpose.Thereâs a simple, easy to grab volume adjustment along the outside of one phone rim â thatâs all I need.

"I received a free item to review.The drive was recognized on Windows 7 32 and 64-bit machines without requiring a driver installation.I like that the spring ejects the disc (as well as the empty caddy) a good inch and a half outwards, unlike my laptop's built-in drive that often barely ejects a half inch. Speaking of eject, I wish the button protruded a bit more from the door front. I find it's easier to press while leaning over the top of the drive from the back and using my index finger, rather than my thumb from the front.The cord is short, perhaps 18 inches. But it's fairly heavy-duty and fine for laptop use, though not ideal for desktops.The instructions warn not to use front panel desktop USB ports due to insufficient power - but I ignored this. I already plug an external Memorex burner into the front port of my 8+ year old Dell Dimension E521. I linked the RUBAN drive and the Memorex with a passive 4-port USB hub and had no problem reading or burning with the RUBAN drive.I also used the drive on a 3 year-old corporate-issued Lenovo laptop straight into a USB port with similar results.I was able to play and burn CDs as well as single and double-sided DVD-ROMs (8.4 GB capacity). I go back to 2x burners in the 90's that had very little underrun tolerance (and with blank HP CD-ROMs originally going for $25 a pop, write errors were an expensive proposition).Although newer software packages like Nero include underrun protection options I still prefer to leave the machine alone while burning and recommend others do as well.Bottom line: 24x burning is adequate for my needs. The RUBAN drive reads/writes fine, and feels well-made and easy-to-use. Cosmetically, I like the flat matte finish, the strong spring response, and the sturdiness of the cord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IOMSUH28M6D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDQR1OY#wasThisHelpful","R3IOMSUH28M6D1","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a straightforward (monophonic) tuner the Polytune works well-enough, although the clip hinge has less mobility (i.e. no swivel) than some smaller clip-on tuners which makes headstock positioning more critical.Iâm a lefty and, whatever gyro-detection itâs using, the tuner really does flip the displayed pitch letters - a nice touch to an already bright, easy-to-read display â at least in basic âStrobeâ mode.But a combination of unfortunate design choices and poor instructions left me with a mixed impression.The larger power button along the narrow side of the tuner is easy to press with minimal force while Iâm wearing the guitar in playing position. But the two buttons on the longer edge, one to toggle the display between âStrobeâ and âNeedleâ modes, and the other to select chromatic pitches are both too small and recessed too far into the case to be comfortable and easy to press. I have to jam my fingernail to press them and for one particular function â setting the reference pitch - you have to hold both down simultaneously, which is a neat trick to pull off.I wish there were more rubber on the spring clip arm surface and directly in front of the spring. Itâs not difficult to scrape that exposed metal along the edge of a headstock where any finish provides less protection. Iâd recommend thin electrical tape to cover those areas without impacting smooth operation.I agree with a point made in the instructions about not keeping the tuner attached âpermanentlyâ, especially in direct sunlight (Iâd add very warm/hot environments). Rubber and lacquer donât play well under heat â I learned the hard way by damaging a vintage Gibson finish by leaving a guitar on a stand with rubber contacts in a hot room several summers back.As far as the display of âpolyphonicâ 6-string tuning of chords, it only seems to appear and remain briefly before the tuner reverts to âmonophonicâ mode and registers what must be the fundamental chord pitch. You strum a chord and see six pairs of alignment bars that stay until the chord resolves itself to its most âpresentâ pitch, which in root position tends to be the root of the chord.Rather than full chords, I tune to a variety of double stops and triads: mostly octaves, 5ths, 4ths and 3rds. Every guitar intonates differently depending on a host of factors and, to be honest, at this point I rely on my ears more than a tuner once I have a reference pitch.But I was curious to see how the Polytune handled intervals:Sure enough, the full chord behavior of reverting the display to the fundamental seems to apply to smaller two and three note dyads and triads - except the polyphonic display doesnât appear at all. When I play ascending fifths simultaneously the bottom tone always displays in the tuner. If I play the higher fifth immediately after sounding the pair, so long as the bottom tone is still sounding the tuner continues to register it. As soon as I stop sounding the lower pitch, the upper pitch registers.This applies to fourths (inverted fifths) as well. When playing G-C ascending as a double stop the C registers in the tuner and will continue so long as itâs sounding.If I tune to a full five or six string chord (usually the last step in the process, just to confirm) Iâm listening for particular pitches that are off, which may or may not be the root. The tuner isn't helping me by confirming the root is in tune if other pitches are out.Iâm willing to accept I may be missing something here, but the instructions are so minimal â and I consider myself fairly savvy about equipment, having played for many years â that I just fail to see the value beyond a basic âmonophonicâ tuner that works well with a display that I'd say is  steps above those tiny monochrome LED chicklet-sized clip-on tuners.Bottom Line: Iâm not sure if thereâs adequate value here, but the display and response for single-string tuning is certainly adequate.As for me, if I have to use a tuner, I grab my old-school Korg AT1-AC from the 80âs, with the long cord and clip-on sensor thatâs perfect for guitar, mandolin, and fiddle â it still works fine and the back-lit needle is even easier for me to read and I know its response very well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANMPLXU7PFYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU4G0ZK#wasThisHelpful","RANMPLXU7PFYQ","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free item to review.If this cutter is truly better than the 'inferior imitations' for sale on Amazon, I'd hate to see how those perform - because this one is flat-out useless.I tried positioning the cutter close to the cork end, as well as further down the neck, holding it while turning either the cutter or the bottle itself. But neither action put more than a surface scratch on the foil. While the plastic cutter frame is not what I'd call delicate or brittle I'm not completely at ease 'wish-boning' the sides out to place around even a normal sized bottle neck. My concern is were the cutter frame to snap it could deliver a nasty gash to my hand and fingers.I examined the cutters - they're not especially sharp and seem to be set too far back into the frame for adequate surface contact.All I know is in the time it took to try this thing out I could have used my 'scratch with the cork remover tip'  technique and removed the foil from at least 3-4 wine bottles.A disappointment to say the least.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17X7O7HK1QEJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010G1CVLS#wasThisHelpful","R17X7O7HK1QEJ0","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The discussions of testing/performance-monitoring tools including HTTP Archive, WebPageTest, and Boomerang are not enough to make anyone an expert (or even proficient) but enough to expose you to their basic capabilities and steer you in the direction of deeper knowledge.The large number of footnote links is a real strength of the book: well-chosen, appearing at appropriate points in the text, and easy to read.The code for the book is easy to grab from github and thereâs an assumed level of expertise as far as basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as maintaining web pages and accessing the developer tools inside various browsers.But itâs not necessary to be a JavaScript or HTML guru to get important lessons from this book. In fact, the most important ideas are not coding idioms and tricks, itâs understanding how website performance is influenced by content, how to sell this to your local group and the broader organization, how to manage and manipulate content to improve performance, and what tools and techniques are available to help you in this effort.I found it eye-opening to shift my perceptions a bit and view websites in terms of Measurable Performance Modules (MPMs) and average number of requests (queries) versus average size of âpayload returnedâ.The early chapter on perceived performance is very well done, taking into account the psychological aspects of user-responses in the ever-faster, ever-more-impatience world everyoneâs site is operating in â like it or not.Rather than hard core developers, Iâm tempted to say the ideal audience here is senior tech leads and group managers who need to understand the technical ins-and-outs mostly in order to explain and sell them to higher, non-technical folks.If thereâs a negative, the overall production value of the book and the graphics in particular are often too small to enjoy without a magnifier in hand(!). But the writing is very clean and informative, with a minimum of jargon, and that more than compensates for the âlo-fiâ production vibe.Finally, thereâs an irony and a lesson in relative perception here for anyone old enough to recall how slow early websites were. I can well remember watching images take forever to load compared to desktop and local client/server applications and thinking to myself, âThis web stuff is a sham.

"With the glut of earphones, headphones, buds, etc. on the market it's tempting to imagine them all made from the same base components at some Chinese factory and simply customized per casing and brand.But listening experience suggests otherwise and, for anyone seriously interested in audio, I would recommend direct A-B comparisons using the same set of music â ideally each piece featuring various instruments, textures, ambience, and frequency span.Itâs really enlightening and just plain fun to uncover real and often dramatic differences in relative signal strength, frequency response as well as the overall 'voicing' of the devices that can drastically alter the clarity and warmth of what you hear.I compared the Bose earphones to two sets of Brainwavz earphones and a no-name import brand that impressed me with its bass response.The Bose phones have neither the richest bass response nor the shimmering top end, but what they have hands-down over the other phones is amazing clarity and superior gain - even compared to some full over the ear headphone phones I own.Clarity in this case means the instrumental separation and detail is at the forefront and not obscured by excessive bass (donât get me wrong, I love bass, but not overall muddiness). The other phones sounded either more-distance, with excessive high-end, or unbalanced compared to the Bose.Just for kicks I tried the Bose phones in a non-musical context (an online class) and they performed great â although I wish the cable were a couple of feet longer for plugging into a desktop computer rather than a portable phone or player.While sound is job one a very close second is comfort and the Bose phones really shine here for me. For some reason a lot of âdeep earâ phones are flat out uncomfortable for me to wear - with or without the surrounding hook. If you wear these things in public whether at work or while commuting you going to have to take them out occasionally and doing that comfortably makes a real difference.As someone famously described talking about music, talking about sound is like dancing about architecture so I can only repeat my earlier suggestion: gather together a bunch of phones, choose some music you enjoy listening to and know well, and go round-robin. Youâll learn things I promise - and you just may decide to hang onto multiple pairs of phones for different kinds of listening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBF2IEUYNZZYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFYQE#wasThisHelpful","RBF2IEUYNZZYT","A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This app is basically a digital version of the US Army Field Manual 3-05.70 (formerly FM 21-76), probably the most popular Army Field Manual of all time.  While it is primarily geared towards a soldier lost in the field, with chapters such as ""Survival Movement in Hostile Areas"" and ""Camouflage"", the majority of the manual is useful for civilians as well.  The manual includes information on first aid, obtaining shelter, water and food, lighting a fire, expedient weapons and tools, dangerous plants and animals, direction finding, signaling, and surviving in the desert, tropics, arctic or at sea.I noticed there are some glaring errors in the app.  In particular, several of the images for the edible plants in Appendix B are obviously wrong.  The photo for asparagus shows a tree!  The photo for the baobab shows onions, the photo for beech shows some kind of grass-like plant, and the entry for banana has an incorrect photo as well.This app appears to have been lifted from a website, though since there are several websites containing the same erroneous photos, likely all copied from one another, it's hard to say which.While Amazon's website mentions nothing at all about permissions, this app does call on the Modify/Delete SD Card Contents and Read Phone State and Identity permissions.  It can't really do much with that information, fortunately, since it lacks permissions to access the Internet.FM 3-05.70 and its predecessor FM 21-76 are readily available on the Internet for free.  If you don't want to pay the 99 cents for this app, you can easily find it in webpage or PDF form using Google.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ELBGY8KFG0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MCC2MG#wasThisHelpful","R20ELBGY8KFG0D","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sudoku Samurai is a very pretty version of the famous number puzzle.  You can select different Japanese watercolor backgrounds and you can even choose to use Kanji instead of Western numerals.Unfortunately, the actual game play leaves a lot to be desired.  To enter a number, you have to tap on the cell, then tap on the number.  This means filling in notes becomes a tedious process of tapping cell, number, cell, number, cell, number, cell, number, cell, number, over and over again.  There is no option to tap on the number first, then all the cells you want to fill in, a much faster method and the one I prefer.The game also does not automatically clear your notes when you fill in a cell.  You have to remove your notes manually, using the same tedious cell, number, cell, number.The interface can be a bit confusing unless you read the instructions.  Tap the brush to switch between pencil and pen; the only visual indication of which mode you are in is the amount of ink on the brush. The doll in the upper right gives you hints, the lantern in the upper left is the back button.  Tapping the beads on the left undoes your last entry, while the sword clears the entire board.The transitions between screens is extremely slow, with a paper screen closing and opening.  The game crashed several times on my Motorola Xoom tablet during one of these transitions.This app was built using Corona, which means it's chock full of data miners, including OpenFeint, Papaya Social, Flurry, AdKnowledge, InMobi and Inneractive.  It calls on the Full Internet Access, Read Phone State and Identity, and Access Network State permissions.Overall, it's a beautiful app, marred by a clunky interface and a bounty of data harvesters.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUXPREA66VLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006HUPGA6#wasThisHelpful","ROUXPREA66VLY","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mysteryville is a fairly basic hidden-object game.  I made as far as level 4 before dying of boredom; there was only one spot-the-difference puzzle, all the rest were just finding stuff.I was unable to zoom in or move around in any of the puzzles.  Every touch on the screen counted as a mistake, regardless of what I was trying to do.Why does every house in a hidden object game look like it should be on the TV show Hoarders?  And why is it nobody in these games will ever help you unless you clean up their mess?  Just imagine if you ever had to go to the hospital. ""Oh dear, you're bleeding all over the place.  Help me pick up a few things first then I'll put a bandage on that.""Some of the characters are highly stereotyped, almost to the point of racism, particularly the Chinese guy in chapter 3.  ""Then you dlink, blave girl.""  Really?The real hidden objects in this game, however, are the hidden data mining modules.  Flurry and Google Analytics, Facebook and Twitter4j, and a boat-load of permissions, including Read Phone State and Identity, Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, and Full Internet Access.The only mystery in this app is why anyone would pay $3 for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D4ZSTITZBC9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080SC22I#wasThisHelpful","R1D4ZSTITZBC9N","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fruit Fling is your fairly basic match-X type game.  When you make a match, the fruit disappears and the rest of the fruit fills in the hole.  Bombs explode after a couple seconds and fruit bats can be shot at for bonus points.  Hit a rain cloud and the fruit appears faster, while shooting an ice cube slows things down.  Once it stops raining, the ground will begin rising; if the fruit reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.  You start out having to match just three of a kind, but this increases as the levels get harder.There are three game modes, Arcade, which has just one level and you have to match four of a kind, Classic with 24 levels, and Custom that lets you adjust the number of fruit needed to make a match, the frequency that bonus items appear, ground speed, stickiness and other parameters.The game sometimes didn't register two fruits as touching, which lead to lost combos and lower scores.  The game also has a real bad habit of giving you one more of a fruit type that you just eliminated.This app contains modules from OpenFeint, Flurry, Papaya Social, AdKnowledge, InMobi, and Inneractive, HOWEVER, the app lacks any sort of Internet permissions, which means these modules are COMPLETELY INERT.  These modules are likely part of the Corona developer toolkit, which tends to throw in everything but the kitchen sink.

It features flashcards, a quiz and a glossary as well as a news feed.This might be a decent quiz app, except the multiple-choice answers to the questions are so utterly obvious.  Even if you don't know the answer, you can figure it out because the other two answers are stupidly impossible.  For instance, the question ""This is a garden with a large collection of trees and shrubs"" has the possible answers ""Tuber"", ""Alternate Host"", and ""Arboretum"".  Really?The glossary is just row after row of definitions, no illustrations or other insight.The ""news"" button does nothing but point your web browser to Google.On my Motorola Xoom tablet, there is vast amounts of wasted space.  Most of the quiz questions and flashcards take up 1/4 to 1/2 of the screen.Some of the images were missing and replaced with a ? symbol.

"Cross Fingers is a tangram-style puzzle game.  You have to slide pieces around the game board so that they fit together to form a shape.  Most pieces stay where you put them, but the red ones will move back so you have to hold them in place with a finger.The pieces didn't track my finger very well; on the more complex puzzles this frequently caused other pieces to be knocked out of place. -1 star for this.When you open the app, you are immediately slapped in the face with a full-screen advertisement for a bunch of different games.  There were so many game ads, you actually have to scroll down to view them all!  At the bottom of the screen is a small button you have to press to open the game.  This comes up EVERY SINGLE TIME you start the game!  Even free apps aren't usually this obnoxious with their ads.  -3 stars for this.The game also has an absurd number of permissions, the most worrisome of which are Full Internet Access, Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, and Read Phone State and Identity.

"In Noogra Nuts, you play a hungry squirrel who can bash open nuts with his head.  You tilt your device left and right to move and tap the screen to jump.  Bash a shell enough times and it will split open, then you can feast on the tasty nut inside.There are three game modes.  Classic gives you 2 minutes to crack as many nuts as possible.  Jungle adds some obstacles such as rolling boulders that will end the game instantly.  Survival gives you unlimited time, but you have only 3 hit points and must dodge falling rocks and tumbleweeds.  As you play you earn Noogra Coins which you can use to purchase hats, some of which grant special abilities.The game works well on my Motorola Xoom.  The animation and controls are smooth and fluid.  The squirrel character is cute, especially when his head gets distorted while smashing a nut.Unfortunately, the game comes with a double whammy of OpenFeint and Flurry Analytics.  It also uses Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, Full Internet Access, and Read Phone State and Identity permissions.  The ability to access the SD card combined with Internet access always rings alarm bells.  With this combo, a malicious application could upload your documents or photos, which, if geotagged, could also provide someone with your exact location.The author's name isn't even listed on Amazon, it's just ""Developer"", which helps to make this app sound all the more suspicious.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJYMKAOHRSRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PT6UB2#wasThisHelpful","R2FJYMKAOHRSRQ","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Front Runner is a vertical scrolling space shooter with a cartoony style.  Shoot enough enemies and they will drop musical notes.  Collect the notes and you can purchase upgrades to your ship at the end of the stage.  You start out with just a basic gun, which can be upgraded to shoot sideways and backwards; after defeating a boss you can acquire their weapons such as homing missiles or lightning bolts.  Complete Story Mode to unlock Survival Mode.The game is fairly challenging, particularly the boss fights, but it's not too difficult.  I died while fighting the first boss, but the game let me keep all the notes I'd collected to that point in the stage, so I was able to buy some armor upgrades and try again.The game has no In-App Purchasing, nor OpenFeint, Flurry or any other evil tracking modules.  Alas, it does call on the Full Internet Access and Send Sticky Broadcast permissions.  (Sticky broadcasts means the app can load information into memory where it remains available to every other app until the app removes it or the device is rebooted.  This wastes memory and is a potential security hole.)

"Gunship II is a Vietnam War era combat flight simulator.  The game currently offers 5 missions, with the developer claiming several more are coming soon.  The first mission is to transport a load of cargo from a carrier to a land base using an H-34 Choctaw.  Then you have to take photos of a couple suspicious villages using an H-13 Sioux.  The third mission is to rescue a pilot trapped behind enemy lines using a UH-1D Huey.  This is followed by an air patrol in a UH-1B Huey Gunship.  The final mission involves another observation helo drawing enemy fire so your AH-1 Cobra can target them.  Future missions will supposedly involve the F-4 Phantom II, T-28 Trojan, A-37 Dragonfly, CH-47 Chinook, OH-6 Cayuse and two enemy aircraft, the MiG-15 and MiG-21.The controls are fairly simple, you slide the control on the left up and down to adjust the throttle (and thus increase or decrease altitude), while the control on the bottom right works the rudder.  You move forward, backwards and sideways by tilting your device.  The camera button lets you switch between interior and exterior cameras, and you can look around by swiping on the screen.  If your aircraft has guns or a camera, the appropriate fire buttons will appear in the lower right corner.  The red bar along the top is your aircraft health.Some people have complained about a lack of instructions, but they are provided for you IF you follow the designated flight path.  Just fly through the red arrows and all will be explained.The graphics are pretty good, and the developer did a great job on the rotor motion effects.My primary complaint about the game is that there are no instruments, particularly an altimeter.  It is sometimes difficult to figure out how high you are above the ground.  An airspeed indicator and vertical speed indicator would be handy too.I think there is a glitch in the second mission.  It kept complaining I was too far away while taking the photos, even when I landed right in the middle of the area where I was supposed to take pictures!  Do they want me to get out and take portraits of the soldiers or something?  Say pho mÃ¡t!The game works well on my Motorola Xoom, however many of the buttons in the game are black with no labels at all.  This isn't a problem when there is only one button, such as at the end of a mission, but pressing the pause button brings up four blank buttons.

"Word to Word is a word association puzzle game. You are given two columns of words and you have to match together words that are related; they can be synonyms (hot-warm), antonyms (hot-cold), compound words (hot-dog) or merely related in some way (hot-summer). Higher levels will have multiple possible matches for some words, making the game much trickier. The game comes with 440 puzzles.This game is a lot of fun and is actually pretty challenging, especially on the later puzzles. It's also one of the more unique games I've seen so far.The game works great on my Motorola Xoom tablet.The best part of this app is that there is absolutely no villainy on the part of the developer. No In-App Purchasing. No OpenFeint, Flurry or other data miners. No permissions of any kind! It's also a relatively small app, at 3.3 MB. And it only costs 99 cents!

"Ion Racer is a high-speed twitch-reflex racing game.  Collect ion orbs for energy and smash through the blue barriers for points, but don't hit the red ones, they will damage your shields.  Hit a red barrier without any shields left and the race is over.Controls in the game were terrible.  Several times the game stopped responding to my inputs and I just smashed through whatever was in front of me, unable to move.The missions require you to exceed a certain speed or collect a given number of ions, but there is no speedometer or other indication of how far you have progressed within the mission until the game ends.This is another of those games that make it difficult to progress without resorting to In-App Purchasing.  The upgrades and perks cost so much and you get coins so slowly that even the second mission is impossible to pass without upgrades.  Completing missions is the only way, other than spending cash, to obtain a decent number of coins.This app contains a module from the advertiser MoPub, though it does not display ads.  It does, however, have some rather excessive permissions, calling on the Course (Network-based) Location, Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, View Network State and Full Internet Access permissions.

"This app is one of the best references I've ever seen for tying knots.  There is a quick animation for each type of knot, and you can rotate the image 360 degrees so you can get a good look at it.  The app also describes the uses for each knot and its advantages and disadvantages.  It covers just about every knot you could ever need to tie, though disappointingly, it leaves out necktie knots entirely.It works great on my Motorola Xoom tablet (though only in portrait mode) and my HTC Evo LTE.EDIT:  When I originally wrote this review, the app was loaded with spyware such as OpenFeint and Flurry and a ton of permissions.  Since then, the developer has listened to the reviews and removed all that junk.

"In the year 4122, genetic experiments have brought dinosaurs back from extinction and given them intelligence. One of these intelligent creatures, called nanosaurs, was sent back 65 million years into the past to recover eggs. Upon returning to the future, however, a group of rebels stole all but one of the eggs and took them to other planets in hopes of raising an army. The sole remaining egg hatched into a pteranodon. Equipped with a jetback, it is sent through a wormhole to retrieve the stolen eggs.Nanosaur 2 is a fairly unique flight game. You control your motion by tilting your device. The blue button in the left corner is your jetback booster, the red button in the lower right fires your weapon. The green button next to it switches weapons. You start out with a blaster with 20 shots and a sonic scream which has infinite ammo and can be charged by holding the fire button. You can acquire additional ammo and new weapons, including heat-seeking missiles, fragmentation grenades and bombs, by flying through green powerups.Across the top of the screen you have a map, the number of eggs you need to collect, how many lives you have remaining (you start with 3), then your health, shield and fuel status. These three can be restored by flying through the red, purple and blue powerups, respectively; additional lives can be obtained by with the yellow powerups. Below the map is the calibrate button which you can press if your controls start acting up.The objective of the game is to fly low and grab the eggs (which will be done automatically when you get close enough), then carry them to one of the waiting wormholes where they will be sent back to Earth. If you get hit, you will drop your egg and you'll have to pick it up again. Collect all the eggs on the planet, and the wormhole will change color. Fly into it to travel to the next world. You can only save your game after completing a world.Game play is excellent and the controls are intuitive. The graphics look incredible and the game runs quite smoothly on my Motorola Xoom.My sole complaint is that there is no training mission or tutorial, you just get thrown right into the action. I died in less than 5 seconds the first time I played because I had no idea what I was doing. There is a very detailed help file, but that doesn't really make up for a lack of tutorial.The application is fairly large, over 55 MB, but it is quite a lot of game.

"This app is exactly what it calls itself, a jigsaw puzzle.  The game has over 150 different images and you can create puzzles with your own pictures.  There is also a challenge mode which blacks out some of the squares; the hidden areas are revealed every 5 seconds.The game has a fairly large number of options.  You can choose between square or rectangular puzzles and you have the option of plain or the more traditional jigsaw-shaped pieces.  To make the game easier, you can lock matched pieces together, snap pieces to the game board, or have a faint guide image behind the board.  Each puzzle has eight difficulty levels (five on a phone), ranging from 9 pieces up to 100 (49 on a phone).I encountered a few minor issues when moving pieces.  Sometimes they didn't track my finger properly, and if you had snap pieces to game board turned off and lock pieces together turned on, it was difficult to get the game to recognize the puzzle was finished unless you lined it up on the game board just right, even though all the pieces were stuck together.I ran this app through Addons Detector and it has only two add on modules, Amazon Licensing, which is to be expected of an app coming from Amazon, and Application Crash Report for Android (ACRA).  The latter is probably the reason the app requires Internet permissions.Ultimate Jigsaw Puzzle HD has more puzzles and more options than Spectrum Puzzles, and it handles a large screen tablet better, but the latter has fewer frustrations when moving pieces around and also allows rotation of pieces, making for a much more challenging game.  Spectrum is $1 cheaper, but adding the two image packs to give it the same number of images makes it cost $1 more.  Personally I'd choose Spectrum Puzzles over this app, but only by a fairly slim margin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKYS1F6XBSHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053R08CU#wasThisHelpful","R3FKYS1F6XBSHJ","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The object of Juminja is to shoot colored balls to match 3 or more ninja balls that are marching down a path.  If the balls reach their destination, you lose a life; clear them all to move to the next level.This game is very similar to a previous Free App of the Day, Bonsai Blast, except that the latter is actually well written and enjoyable.The interface for this game is very haphazard and in many cases downright broken.  The OpenFeint button is right on top of the exit button, making it impossible to press exit without launching OF.  The icon that tells you what color ball is next sits atop the icon showing how many lives you have left.  The Menu button doesn't work unless you press it in just the right spot; it typically took me about a dozen attempts to find that spot.  The help text was off-center and ran off the edge of the sign.  Bonus symbols would sometimes float around on their own.Accuracy leaves much to be desired.  I frequently had balls simply shoot off the screen or attach themselves to the wrong place.  I lost the very first level because of this.The game has OpenFeint AND In-App Purchasing.  The latter appears to be only used to unlock all the levels, which is far less odious than some of the games we've seen recently.And the biggest insult of all is that the game isn't even the least bit fun.  I enjoyed Bonsai Blast, but I got to only the second level of Juminja before quitting in disgust.1 star for a terrible game, then minus stars for OF, IAP, and sloppy programming, giving this app a score of negative a whole bunch.  Bleah.EDIT:  After reading a number of other reviewers complaining about ads in the app, I decided to reinstall it and run it through Addons Detector.  What it returned absolutely shocked me.  This game contains modules from AdMob, GreyStripe, InMobi, JumpTap, Millenial, MoPub, Nexage, PontiFlex, Smaato and AirPush advertisers, as well as Flurry, OpenFeint, AndEngine, Facebook and Twitter4j.

"In Meowch!, you play a runaway cat, trying to escape the clutches of a crazy cat lady.  You leap about window ledges and light fixtures, bounce off satellite dishes, climb hanging vines and slide down gutters, avoiding power lines and Animal Control, while collecting ""missing cat"" posters and trying to reach a safe hiding place on the ground.At first I thought this was just an Angry Birds clone, drag your finger to launch the cat, but the second level changed that pretty quick.  You have to make multiple jumps per level, and sometimes you have to make your next leap in a hurry before you are grabbed by the cat lady.I found the cat lady to be the most difficult of the obstacles in the game; if you land on a lit window, you have only a second or two to make another jump before she grabs you and yanks you inside!  Oh noes!There is a time limit to each level, but it's about 3 minutes, and you can add another 1 minute and 40 seconds for each poster you nab, for a maximum of 8 minutes.  You shouldn't need anywhere near that much time.I love the graphics in this game, particularly some of the cat animations.  The game is fairly challenging (it took over a dozen tries to get all three posters on level 1-3), yet fairly forgiving at the same time (you'll stick to a ledge even if your landing isn't perfect).The app works perfectly and looks great on my Motorola Xoom LTE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R986HVHR9AHL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SPQ04A#wasThisHelpful","R986HVHR9AHL4","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Rope Rescue, you have to save your fellow birds by dragging a rope around a number of pulleys, avoiding knives, fire and other obstacles, and connecting to a hook on a cage.  The shorter the length of rope, the more points and the more feathers you are awarded.  Occasionally, you'll have the opportunity to release a butterfly.  These are used to unlock a level or obtain a hint or extra time.  You can also get a butterfly for every 25 feathers, or buy them with real money using In-App Purchasing.Originally I wasn't going to dock this game because the IAP didn't appear to be too necessary, but then I did some counting.  You can only obtain a maximum of 30 butterflies in the game: 3 you start with, 10 if you get at least 250 of the 252 available feathers, and 17 if you can release all the butterflies in each level.  It takes 30 butterflies to unlock the Infinity Hall world, which means you have to complete nearly every single level with a perfect score AND you cannot use any butterflies anywhere else in the game, otherwise, you'll only be able to play the final level by paying cash for it.[EDIT:  My bad, there are 31 butterflies available in the game, I missed one while counting the releasable butterflies (18, not 17).  But this still is an awfully slim margin, you either can use one hint and then have to complete nearly every level with a perfect score, or you can play without hints and can afford to miss an average of just 4-1/2 feathers per world.  Use two hints and you will HAVE to pay if you want to unlock the final world.]I feel this takes the app out of the realm of acceptable IAP and drops it squarely into evil.  At $2.99, the app is already pushing the boundaries of price, adding a virtually required IAP is just a slap in the face to the consumer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBB9FFD385EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089ZM1GY#wasThisHelpful","R2GBB9FFD385EG","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Space Station: Frontier, you are in command of a mining station.  You build out a power network and connect mining drones, power generators and weapons, while trying to defend the power grid and station against incoming fighters, destroyers and battleships.This is a 5 star game.  The graphics are great, it has a good story line, and the gameplay is excellent.  Unfortunately, it is completely ruined by In-App Purchasing.  The developer has chosen to make it impossible to proceed in the campaign mode until you have purchased upgrades.  You can spend real cash to get the upgrades, or grind for hours to earn enough credits.After the third level, the game advises you to play endless mode to earn more credits and upgrade your station before continuing in campaign mode.  I played for 15 minutes before I got bored and let the enemy win, and in all that time I'd managed to accumulate just 120 credits.  Let's see what that would buy....  The Missile Launcher is 300 credits, so I'd need to play for at least another 20 minutes before I could buy that.  The Interceptor Laser is 150 credits, so I can't buy that one yet either.  A Rail Cannon is 500 points, that's probably around 45 minutes more play.  Power Generator, 300 credits, Power Storage is 150, Repair Stations, 400.  Proton Torpedoes cost a whopping 2000 credits, that's well over 4 hours of mind-numbing play to earn those.  And there are other station upgrades that speed up your energy recharge or capacity, health, and other stats; all of these have 2 to 20 levels each.To upgrade everything requires just shy of 15,000 credits.  At about 120 credits for 15 minutes of ""endless"" play, it would require over 31 hours to earn enough to fully upgrade the station.  And it is very difficult to complete the campaign mode without all the upgrades.In-App Purchasing in a paid game is bad enough, but when the developer makes it nearly impossible to finish the game without spending more money, it's just downright greedy.The app used to have OpenFeint, but it was allegedly removed.

"This app is all the fun of slot car racing, without having to mess around with those plastic tracks that never seem to fit together right.  The game comes with 18 tracks, you can make your own, and you can download others from the community.  You can upgrade your slot car with new tires, motor, frame or body.Control is pretty simple, just slide your finger along the throttle to adjust your speed.  It's not quite as realistic as a pistol-grip, but a bit easier to fine tune.  Unfortunately, the controls are rather badly broken.  Many times per track, the car would just stop and the throttle slider would drop to zero as if I'd taken my finger off the screen.  I ended up losing several races because of this.This game has In-App Purchasing.  Upgrading your virtual toy car requires spending coins, 665,000 if you want to fully trick out your ride.  At 3,100 points maximum per race, that would require coming in first 215 times!  It doesn't tell you how much it costs to buy those points until you actually try to purchase them.The second time I started the app, a popup window tried to sell me a fully tricked out vehicle, the Amazing Capone.  You can only get this vehicle if you spend real money, you can't obtain it through playing the game.  It doesn't say how much this car will cost (I have IAP disabled, so it won't tell me).I like that the app has a track editor.  You can create your own racing masterpiece, then upload it for others to play.  Some of the tracks available from the community look absolutely insane, including one where you end up racing way up in the sky.  This is probably the best part of the game.This could be a 5 star app, but I'm docking 1 star for In-App Purchasing, another for pushing an IAP-only vehicle whenever I start the game, and a third for broken controls, and I'm awarding an extra star for the track editor and ability to download other people's track designs, for a total of 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RG6UZXQ51K49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GB20UY#wasThisHelpful","R2RG6UZXQ51K49","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a first-person dungeon crawler with a cheese theme.  Your enemies are genetically modified dairy products and accoutrements, such as cheese slices with fangs or evil crackers.  You pick up various items as you explore the dungeon, like a cheese knife to use as a weapon, or a paper plate for a shield.The game starts out with you wandering about a dungeon.  Upon encountering an enemy, the game switches to combat mode.  When an enemy is vulnerable, cross-hairs appear and you can swipe across them to attack.  When it tries to attack you, you can defend by pressing the shield button or attempt to parry by swiping across the screen at the right moment.  You can also distract an enemy by tossing a cracker at them.  If the battle gets to be too much, you can tap the button at the center bottom of the screen to run away.There are several mini-games you have to solve to proceed.  So far, I've found a Memory-type game, a Tower of Hanoi puzzle, and a Simon-like game.The graphics are somewhat old-school, but not bad.  The dairy-based monsters are a bit amusing.Unfortunately, the controls stink like three month old Limburger.  You move about the dungeon by endlessly swiping up, left or right.  Combat is particularly annoying because the defensive moves such as raising your shield are terribly slow, if they work at all.  I've died 28 times so far; luckily, you get infinite lives on the Casual difficulty setting.The game kind of grows on you, like mold on a wedge of Cheddar.  Like every other dungeon crawler I've played, it's hard to quit, you want to explore just a bit further to see what you can find.

You can even record the growth of your ""baby bump"".Unfortunately, there are also a number of issues.  The first problem that has put a number of people off this app is that once you input your name, age and sex, it doesn't appear to let you do anything.  You have to press the small button in the upper left that looks like a scale with feet.  That is apparently the home button.  It would be nice if there were something pointing this out, as it has no label.The app defaults to measuring your height in feet and inches, but your weight in kilograms, an odd combination.  The units can only be changed by going into Manage Users and selecting Edit User.  This has to be done for each person who uses the app.On my tablet, everything is small and there is a ton of wasted space.  The calendar, for instance, only takes up little more than 1/2 the screen.While the app does have the ability to export to a file, it lacks a cloud synchronization feature.

It has a good story line, and the graphics are good enough, though occasionally a bit blurry on my Xoom tablet.It's a bit confusing when your character keeps saying she needs to find one particular item, like a doll or a watch, but then you start searching for a dozen things that aren't that one item.I would have given this game 5 stars, but I'm docking one because it keeps bugging me to log into Facebook or rate the app.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK61BXYK0CRCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R8GK2Q#wasThisHelpful","RK61BXYK0CRCG","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This app tries to be a series of puzzles, but what it succeeds at is being annoying.  Many of the puzzles have no instructions, so you have to try to guess at what it wants you to do.  There are also at least a few ""trick question"" puzzles.Worst of all, however, is the controls are completely broken.  Objects don't follow your finger correctly, and there is at least one maze level that is extremely hard to finish because of this.Often, if you make a mistake, the game forces you to start over several puzzles previous.  Since the puzzles are all exactly the same each time, it can become annoying have to hit the same items repeatedly just to get back to where you were.If you're thinking of buying a puzzle game, just keep walking.  If you pay money for this app, you've already failed the test.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R237S9NUAZGWMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TCMOY2#wasThisHelpful","R237S9NUAZGWMN","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The game of MASH has been around for ages; I can remember playing this when I was a kid. Of course, we had to use paper back in the Middle Ages. Now you can play on your phone or tablet.In the basic version, you enter various locations, jobs, vehicles, colors, names, numbers, and animals--you can type your entries or use the randomize button to have them entered for you--and it will come up with a prediction about your future, such as, ""Once you graduate, you'll find work in Portland, Oregon as a Veterinarian. You'll get around town in your burgundy scooter. You'll marry Alexis and live in a Mansion with your 44 kids and ever-loyal pet pony.""The paid ""Elite"" version of MASH lets you download additional stories; there are currently 18 available. These include games such as Superhero, Championship Football Game, Rumors and Dear Diary.This app is not optimized for tablets; on my Xoom it only runs in portrait mode and the buttons are very small. It looks much better on my Evo LTE.Overall it's a cute little app, loads of fun for kids, or nostalgic adults who remember playing this in their youth. I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm currently docking one for poor tablet support.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UDIN2C0UVHIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007375V4I#wasThisHelpful","R1UDIN2C0UVHIZ","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Router Aqua is the sequel to park3mobile's excellent puzzle game Router.  It's quite simple, draw lines connecting the dots.  If you can make the shortest possible routes, you get five stars and a Star Point.  Hints are available at the cost of five star points.Unfortunately, the developer has succumbed to the Dark Side and added In-App Purchasing to a paid game.  In this case, it's to purchase Star Points, which are needed for hints.  It costs $1 to purchase 30 points, which is 6 hints, or $5 for 200 points/40 hints.  Luckily the game isn't that hard, and you accumulate enough points for another hint for every five puzzles you complete with a perfect score; you also start with 10 free points.  I got to level 89 in the original Router and had accumulated 99 Star Points.5 stars, minus 2 stars for in-app purchasing in a paid game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELSCSAVJX7EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006THXYK6#wasThisHelpful","RELSCSAVJX7EU","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This app is one of the most basic Sudoku apps I've ever seen. The interface is primitive and it lacks features found in many other Sudoku games.The graphics are unimpressive and amateurish. The app forces the operating system to run in portrait mode on my tablet, placing the system buttons and menus on the side of the screen, even though the app itself is reluctantly capable of displaying in landscape. There is a large amount of wasted space on the edges, and the background image falls short of covering the whole screen. When I pressed the Menu button, I got a dialog box full of gibberish. Even the icon looks boring.This app does not appear to have any way of entering pencil marks. It will fill in some marks if you press the Crib button, however it still leaves many of the spaces blank, making this feature nearly useless. Besides, I'd rather do the work myself.There is a large button labeled Solve which will start filling in the answers if you press it. Since it's right next to the numbers, and above the Undo button, I imagine it would be quite easy to hit it accidentally. It doesn't ask if you are sure you want it solved for you, it just starts doing it the instant you press it.Pressing the back button on your device exits the game rather than taking you back to the menu.The game has only 3 difficulty levels, the fewest I've seen of any Sudoku game except the ones they print in the newspaper.The permissions this app asks for are questionable. Why does it require read phone state and identity, view network state, and full Internet access? I can't find any features in this game that would require the Internet.3 stars for mediocre design, then -3 for no pencil marks, -2 for questionable permissions, -1 for having only three difficulty levels, and -1 for poor tablet interface. Inability to enter pencil marks is an absolute deal breaker for me.I'd HIGHLY recommend Sudoku 4ever Plus or Enjoy Sudoku over this app. The former has several interesting Sudoku board variants and multiple markup systems, the latter has an excellent tutorial if you're new to the game or want to learn some advanced solving techniques.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300OR5WXAPVF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MKRVLE#wasThisHelpful","R300OR5WXAPVF8","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an educational app intended for very young children.  The name of an animal is spoken and you press the appropriate image.  There are two modes, Tik Tok, which has a time limit, and Play All Day, which continues indefinitely.  Tik Tok has three difficulty levels, Play All Day adjusts automatically.  If you take too long, the game will bounce the correct choice up and down; the hint delay is adjustable from 5 to 15 seconds or it can be disabled.I was surprised at how many animals this game has.  It displayed about 60 different creatures before it began repeating and there are at least 75 unique animals total.  Each one has an amusing illustration.The only problem I could find with the app is if you touch the animal too quickly, the game sometimes gives the 'wrong answer' response.  If your child is quick, this could become confusing.This game requires no permissions!  Kudos to the developer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127AOZHRBHO71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006P1UNNC#wasThisHelpful","R127AOZHRBHO71","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this paid app contains in-app purchasing.  It's 99 cents if you want to unlock all levels, or 99 cents to buy a ""Golden Tofu"" to skip a level.  These prices are not shown unless you actually press the purchase button.  It also doesn't say if the Golden Tofu is a one-shot item, or if the purchase is good for multiple levels.  At least the in-app purchases with this game are good for all devices on the account and aren't lost if the game is reinstalled, unlike many other games.Some of the levels appear to be deliberately designed to be impossible (or at least extremely difficult) to finish.  For instance, I tried playing level 3 a couple dozen times and was never able to complete it in the required three moves.  I'm not sure it's even possible.Most of the levels have to be played at least twice to achieve all the objectives.  Level 3, for instance, requires eight moves to collect all the Chi, way more than the three moves required to complete the limited moves objective.The controls are very imprecise.  Some of the levels require a fair amount of accuracy, which just isn't possible to achieve.  On many levels you have to aim at a point that's off the screen; you can scroll to see where you're going, but you can't launch from there.  Make a single mistake and you have to start the level over again.The game is extremely slow moving.  It takes almost 20 seconds from the time you finish a level until you can begin playing the next.  If you complete all 150 levels in one pass each, that's 50 minutes of wasted time!  You can't skip the animations at the beginning and end of a level, nor the death animations.  This becomes rather annoying, especially if you have to keep retrying a level.Exiting the game requires that you press the pause button, then quit, then yes, then the back arrow, and finally the X in the corner.  That's 5 screen taps just to exit the game!  If you press the Home key on your device, the game will continue running with Foreground priority, eating up CPU time and battery.This app has one of the longest permissions lists I've ever seen in a paid game.  It wants full Internet access, modify/delete SD card contents, read phone state and identity, view network state, and modify battery statistics.  It can also change your audio settings, prevent device from sleeping, and control vibrator, though these permissions are usually harmless.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6PYBC18PRDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083C1ZAG#wasThisHelpful","RQ6PYBC18PRDZ","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this first-person shooter, you're trapped in a cemetery full of zombies; your goal is to survive until 6 am.  There are 3 game modes available.  In Bone Collector, your objective is to collect all the cursed bones and return them to the sarcophagus before time runs out.  Survive the Night requires you to merely stay alive until 6.  Dead by Dawn is the ultimate zombie apocalypse; there is no end, just stay alive as long as you can.  There is also a simple tutorial.The graphics are good, but everything is very dark and you can only see about 10 feet in front of you.  This enhances the spookiness of the game, but it also makes it very hard to figure out where you are or what direction you're traveling.  You can easily get lost, which isn't as big a deal in most of the game modes, but can become a serious problem trying to find your way back to the sarcophagus in Bone Collector.  My single biggest frustration with this game was trying to figure out where I was going.The radar is of vital importance in Bone Collector, since it's really the only way to find the bones in time, but it doesn't show where the walls are, so often I'd find myself on the wrong side having to hunt for an opening.The controls also leave a lot to be desired.  You control your movement with a thumb joystick on the left, with no option to place it anywhere else, and shoot by tapping the screen.  This is harder than it sounds if you're playing on a tablet, since you have to hold the device with just your left hand.  It's probably easier with a smaller, lighter phone.  When I played, the gun would go off randomly at times.The game ran smoothly on my Motorola Xoom with ICS, even on the highest graphics settings.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DIHDNQ2ETXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065LRZQ0#wasThisHelpful","R25DIHDNQ2ETXI","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is the first cricket app I've ever seen.  It's certainly the first cricket FAotD.The graphics look fantastic and the sound is great.  There is an announcer calling the play by play, and while he does get a bit repetitive after a while, this is true of most sports games.The one major flaw with this app is that it lacks any sort of instructions on how to play cricket.  It has instructions on how to play this particular computer game, but not the game of cricket in general.  I understand you're suppose to hit the ball, but that's about it.  This game is clearly written for the cricket enthusiast, however, I doubt you'll find very many in the US.  In fact, the game doesn't even have an American team.[EDIT: I didn't realize it, but this app actually includes two different games, World Cricket Championship and World Premier League.  I initially thought the button for the latter was just a league logo, like the MLB logo in a baseball game.  WCC and WPL appear to have the same gameplay and follow the same basic rules, just different teams and different tournament systems.  And the WPL does include a handful of American teams.]A practice mode where you can just practice your pitching or hitting skills would be a nice addition.If you're one of those rare Americans who actually understands the sport, then this app is a definite must purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWJ4S0RQ5LDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071NQKNK#wasThisHelpful","R2DWJ4S0RQ5LDI","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This app is a series of what could barely be described as mini-games.  First you have to tap on the alarm clock 5 times to wake Daisy up.  I suppose that might be difficult, if you are like 1 year old.  Then you get to watch her take a shower, or not, because she runs the water so hot she has a tule fog surrounding her.  Next you have to help her pick out her outfit; luckily, she only owns like a half dozen articles of clothing.Then she gets locked out of her apartment, and rather than going to get the manager to let her back in like a normal person, she decides to kick the door down. If she's spotted by any of her neighbors, they call the police.  This is the first level with any serious difficulty, as her neighbors put Gladys Kravitz to shame.  If you can manage to get back in without being frisked by the cops, then you have to read her mind and make her a smoothie.This is as far as I was able to get in the game.  After this, you have to sort shoes, then commit battery on random strangers at the mall, then you can go on a date with Brad!  Isn't he dreamy?This is, without a doubt, one of the worst games I've ever played.  If at any point you make a mistake, you get shown an advertisement with an incredibly tiny button to dismiss it, and you have to start all over.  Since, of course, Brad will understand perfectly that Daisy is rescheduling their date because she drank the wrong smoothie that afternoon.[EDIT:  The advertisement in this game links to Top Girl, a free game with some rather expensive in-app purchasing.  The comments for that app include parents whose children have spent hundreds of dollars on virtual goods.  If your kids use your phone or tablet to play games, you can disable in-app purchasing by opening the Appstore app, pressing the menu button and selecting Settings, then In-App Purchasing; clear the checkbox to prevent purchases entirely.  If you wish to allow in-app purchasing, but provide limits, you can instead go into Parental Controls within the Settings menu and select Enable Parental Controls.  This will require entering your Amazon password each time an in-app purchase is made.  You can also check Use PIN if you would prefer to use a PIN instead of your full password.]","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G68PU1JONO1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BSO9G0#wasThisHelpful","R3G68PU1JONO1Q","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this game, puzzle pieces drop from the top of the screen, and you have to place them in order to complete a circuit from one side to the other.  Some pieces rotate, some don't.  Some can move back and forth, others can't.  The game has 4 modes: Timed, where you race against the clock, Block Limit, which gives you a limited number of pieces, Unlimited, with infinite time and pieces, and Story, which basically serves as the tutorial and combines all three other modes.The graphics are reminiscent of the retro-futuristic style used in Bioshock, with dials, push buttons and analog counters and a gritty, metallic feel to everything.The game is an interesting concept, however I found the gameplay to be rather frustrating at times, particularly with some of the rotating pieces; they never seemed to face the direction I needed them to.  This can be especially bothersome in the Block Limit games, where you only have a limited number of pieces to work with, so you can't afford to throw any away.This app also includes that add-on everyone loves to hate, OpenFeint.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LCGWIYSUD19B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00794K8SO#wasThisHelpful","R2LCGWIYSUD19B","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(Actually, they look the same, but the formatting fits the phone's small screen much better than the larger tablet.)  This app desperately needs a tablet-specific update.  -1 star until it gets it.There is no way to save images from within the app, you have to launch your browser and save the image from there.  This is almost a deal-breaker for me.  -1 star just because of this.The Amazon version of BaconReader is currently at 1.4.155, while the version on Google Play is 1.51; there was a 1.5 before that.  Once again, Amazon is way behind on upgrades.  I don't fault the app or the developers for this, however, it's totally Amazon's fault.I like being able to access Reddit from my tablet, and this is the best app for the job, it just needs a few fixes before it's worthy of 5 stars.

"In this game, you play a chicken who gets hit on the head and now believes he is a ninja. No, really.The controls are quite basic. Press one button to jump, another to slide. Pressing slide will also make you fall faster. Run into a shuriken to throw it and jump over a nest to lay an egg. Hit any object and you have to start the level over. The level ends when you complete the objective, such as collecting a certain number of acorns or coins, laying eggs, or running a specific distance.When you complete each level, you receive a number of gold coins, but other than unlocking bonus levels to collect more coins, there doesn't appear to be any purpose for them; it doesn't even show how many coins you have so far.The graphics are relatively simple, but you really don't want anything overly complicated for games of this type. The character animations are well done, though the sound effects could use a bit of work. The load screens for the game are a bit jarring. I'm surprised that a game that is only 5 MB needs such long load screens. The developer should at least make them themed to the game, and not just black with the name of the company in giant letters.The internet access and phone state permissions are used to send anonymous user information to help improve the game.The game works great on my Motorola Xoom LTE with ICS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJYMN1H21T5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XXDFS6#wasThisHelpful","R2MJYMN1H21T5P","A10GLVITSITGSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10GLVITSITGSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this physics-based puzzle game, you play Mr. Weasel, head of Weasel's Skool 4 Huntin' Chickens. Your students set out to raid a chicken coop, but are instead captured by the farmer. So you do the obvious thing, strap a rocket to your back and try to rescue them!While the game sounds like a clone of Angry Birds, and you do indeed launch the titular character across the screen, the similarity ends there. In Angry Birds, you basically just slam yourself into obstacles, but in Rocket Weasel, you have to try numerous strategies to accomplish your mission. You might have to light firecrackers or burn ropes with your rocket exhaust, avoid leaping porcupines, deploy a parachute, or trigger crazed squirrels armed with mallets. There are even a few levels that have Rube Goldberg-like contraptions.I must say that this is one of the most imaginative and well animated Android games I think I've ever seen. I found it to be even more fun than Angry Birds. The character designs are wonderful and the game is full of surprises, like the little animations Mr. Weasel does if you leave the game idle.The app includes a link to the developer's website where you can vote for a new rocket type to be used in a future update, or suggest your own rocket ideas.

"My baby has been teething and biting everything and anything! Teething can be such a miserable time. I love having some teething toys, hylands teething pellets, and my amber teething necklace to make this stage more tolerable for baby and US! This set of teething toys are cute! Compact and easy to take out! I keep it in my freezer at times and it makes it cool for his gums! Holes make it easy for baby to grasp on. Also comes with a pacifier holder, but the beads are also made from the food grade silicone for him to bite on! Easy to clean with mild soap or throw it in the dishwasher.

If they really cared about the ""pure taste"" the cap would be made of glass and silicone maybe.You might as well make the whole thing from plastic if the cap is plastic really.It keeps beverages warm.The outer sleeve isn't cool to the touch but it won't burn you.If you choose to drink out of the cap, it works well.

"Live Scribe penWhen I first open the box and looked at the contents and realized how it worked, I wanted to give this 2 stars. Here is why:-The pen is wide. Even if the grip were narrower that would help.-The pen rattles. I hate when pens make noise. The ink cartridge is smaller than its housing.-The pen needs special paper to transfer data to the device youâre using.After the initial very negative impression. It grew on me.-The size wasnât as bad as I thought it was going to be. Itâs more comfortable that I thought it would be (I would still prefer a narrower grip).-It doesnât rattle as much or have a lot of give when using (although I would prefer it didnât at all).-And most importantly the functionality of the pen is a lot better than I expected. This is the important part so I will dwell on this for a bit:It uses special paper and I looked at the notebook prices. While not cheap, they are not expensive either.The notebooks are numbered so it knows which notebook you are writing in automatically (or if writing in the included moleskine notebook).It knows which page you are writing in and where on the page. So it makes an accurate representation of the page in the app.I can write without being connected to the app, it stores stuff on the pen and syncs when connected to the app.This is useful to me when I write stuff down and want access to the material when I donât have the notebook but have the phone. All the stuff I jot down is accessible on try phone.Things of note:I wish I can turn off the beep it makes when I turn it on.When you record audio: The pen doesnât have a mic. It used the mic on my phone. So the pen is just a switch for the app to do the recording.So I started my review with 2 stars and worked my way up to 5 stars. But itâs a 5 star recommendation with a few caveats:-Make sure you know what you are getting (the livescribe notebooks, the lack of mic on the device, the rattling, that itâs a ballpoint pen (I donât like ballpoints but if thatâs not an issue for you then donât worry about it), the thickness of the pen etc).But it works so well, if you are ok with everything else, that I do like it and would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8ML6O08K7YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A9Z1JK#wasThisHelpful","RG8ML6O08K7YW","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute and quite cuddly toy even though he has a sound box in him. Our 1 year old gave him a hug instantly.All 4 paws, an ear, and his heart/tummy have buttons to push for sounds and songs.If you hold his heart for a few seconds, he plays his entire repertoire.There are three different levels so he will ""grow"" with your child and continue to provide fun for many months.Two volume levels are always welcome.

"Very large, very convex! I really like this mirror. It attaches easily using two adjustable straps that should work with any headrest - one vertically wraps around the headrest and the other wraps horizontally. Once the straps are tightened,I have complete confidence that it will not come loose and hurt baby. It feels very sturdy once attached. It is made of lightweight yet hardy plastic that is shatterproof for added safety.While I have a similar product from a different company, I like this mirror better because it is more convex, meaning both baby and I have a larger view.The hinge is stiffer than the other product so it moves less with car vibrations.Would definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R620SID47FGHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLFQLMO#wasThisHelpful","R620SID47FGHI","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great chair for forward facing setup.If you have a newborn, then you should have a normal rear facing car seat. That seat should be good enough until they are ready for forward facing seats. The advantage of that is the the baby is still light enough that you can carry baby in car seat and set them in a base that stays in your car.This seat starts at 9 lb for recline position 3 and rear facing. It's is good and solid and very comfy and reclines back enough. But it's something you want to keep in the car. It's good for older kids when you don't want to carry the seat anyway! We can use position 2 now but we will wait until baby is bigger then stop using our other infant seat and switch to this.It is baby approved though for the few times we used it.Position 2 is for 22-40 lb kids facing forward.Position 1 is the most upright for 40-65 lb kids (also forward facing).Installation isn't too bad and supports LATCH (or just seat belts).It feels very safe and solid but the handle for the head adjustment feels very cheap. It get's stuck in squeezed position (to adjust) and I have to mess with it until it pops back out and locks the head position.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBBK9YTRCF8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU9CKTG#wasThisHelpful","R3PBBK9YTRCF8H","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very excited to get this book but was rather disappointed.Some of the movements are quite clumsy and difficult to manage.Most of the ideas behind the book are great, but it needs something. It seems to be missing some transitions between the steps.The back of the book suggests that the book will describe how to build a birdhouse. It misses the mark - the first few steps/pages are great.

"Cool idea, especially if the child shows interest in decorating cakes and such. The spotlight is cool but the motorized spinning isn't really a great idea. It doesn't really go at a speed that you can use. I would suggest just spinning it by hand. It comes with two rather small, plastic, re-usable items to decorate - a vase and a dish/container. There are also 3 cardboard discs included to decorate, which are really kinda cheap-looking. The styler is reminiscent of a caulking gun - you load it with a deco pop filled with play-doh and squeeze. I really don't like purchasing products that require additional purchase of consumables. I wish you could refill the Deco pop containers by hand. However, I don't see that it will be a big problem, since I believe most kids will tire of this before you need to purchase many refills.

The Kenwood is all plastic inside though (except for the bottom).The Breville is all stainless steel on the outside.The Kenwood has a sainless steel base, but the kettle is brushed aluminum.

"This is my second one of these. And my third Philips flosser.I have this, Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser, and it worked well. until it got dropped on the floor and the little door mechanism broke. You can't buy the tiny cheap plastic door from Philips.I decided to try the ""pro"" version to replace the non-pro version linked above. The pro version fires 1, 2, or 3 successive blasts depending on the setting. The blasts are less powerful than the non-pro version.Anyway about a month after owning the pro version, it started firing continuously until I turned it off or the battery died. I was about to call Philips when I was offered this review version.Long story short, I recommend getting the non-pro version. It lasted me years until a drop broke part of it. It also has a more powerful blast.I will see if this pro version will last. I will update my review if it fails.Now to the actual performance. Initially I wasn't impressed with it's ""flossing for people to hate flossing"" message. But I really rely on it now. Yes, I hate flossing but that is not why. I sometimes get food stuck in my back teeth that no brushing or flossing will remove. This is where this shines, and now it's a necessity for me.Manual flossing is supposed to better than using this machine but after I manually floss, I still get some particles to come out when I use this flosser.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZOOV32IG4BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67KBK#wasThisHelpful","R26ZOOV32IG4BN","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is a good number of them too.All-in-all, very satisfied with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQZB8MIUNPMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U26LT34#wasThisHelpful","R1TQZB8MIUNPMF","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to confess this at the beginning of the review: I don't jog. I will never jog. My wife doesn't jog or have plans either. But this is the perfect stroller for us.I have many Graco strollers: inexpensive 4 wheel ones (Graco Verb Click Connect Travel System, Sunshine, Graco Comfy Cruiser Click Connect Travel System, Stratus, moderately expensive 3 wheel ones Graco Aire3 Click Connect Travel System, Gotham.All the other Graco models are great for walking in malls or other indoor smooth areas etc (Aire3 became our favorite until now).This one is what we use to go on walks outdoors. It is perfect for curb to street, uneven roads etc. It is quiet because the wheels are inflatable and it's gentle on baby because of the excellent shock absorbers.The canopy is really good too. I hated the canopy on the Comfy Cruiser and Verb Click. The Aire3 had a better canopy (still has the inexplicable mesh middle which let sun hit baby's eyes).This model has the best canopy (it's closed on top and has mesh windows on the sides for baby to look out of).If you want to go on walks outside, this is the Graco stroller you want.It comes with the good version of the car seat (easliy adjusts) and it's the 35 lb not the 30 lb versions you get with cheaper Gracos.It also comes with the good car seat base that adjusts the recline angle (not the cheap car seat bases that don't adjust angle which they also make).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TIK8YX88EYG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PX8PU9U#wasThisHelpful","R2TIK8YX88EYG8","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really good hand blender (immersion blender).The ice attachment worked really well for me. It's not quiet, but it's not horribly loud.The crushed ice came out perfect.I think if you have a counter-top blender then this is redundant.The ice crushing bowl sits in the 1L beaker.The beaker comes with a separate blade attachment and it's becomes a rather full sized blender. But now there is no convenient was to store everything.The blender stick attachment is made of metal so you don't want to use that in nonstick cookware.It takes up a lot of room. I was thinking I would put it on a counter top but with all the attachments it really doesn't save any more room than having a full sized blender.I'm trying to find out if I can get more attachments to make this more useful (for example other models come with whisk attachment or one for mashing potatoes (big foot or something like that)). I will update my review when I hear back from customer service. I couldn't find a place online that sells attachments (I found some on amazon uk site though so I might resort to that to get the whisk).I would search for other Kenwood or DeLonghi (they own Kenwood) blenders which seem to be compatible (if not identical) and see if they come with attachments you like).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOBQ9NHZ1R8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAG82P4#wasThisHelpful","R2GOBQ9NHZ1R8H","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's actually better than the pictures on the box lead you to believe.The trap doesn't ""snap"" shut, it closes as the weigh of the dinosaur is applied.

"Very well-designed toy - almost every possible surface has a construction-themed mold for creating countless possibilities! Even the Play-Doh containers look like construction safety barrels. Seriously, who doesnât love an extruder?Sure, you canât remove every bit of the play-doh from the extruder mechanism and some might start coming out of the wrong places, and yes, to get the play-doh out of some of the molds can be a little tricky, but this also teaches a lesson. Not everything in life is perfect and easy. Sometimes you need to work at something to get the result you want. A little patience and finesse as well as manual dexterity go a long way!A Play-Doh Knife was not included - would have helped with the extruder and with removing excess Play-Doh from around the molded pieces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XDM1I0ZD5DPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPMDIFS#wasThisHelpful","R2XDM1I0ZD5DPQ","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You get the stroller, car seat, and car seat base.I have found 2 kinds of car seats Graco makes:1. The one I like where you can pull a strap and tighten the whole thing.2. And the cheaper one that you flip the seat over and fiddle with the straps. (don't like).This is the #1 kind (the good one).I have also found that Graco makes at least 2 kinds of bases:1. The one I like where it has a knob that changes the angle of the seat.2. And the cheap one where you have to put towels underneath.This is the #1 kind (the good one).This is my favorite Graco stroller so far simply because of the canopy. We had bought a different mesh canopy extender for our other strollers just to keep the sun out of baby's eyes (they don't do well if it's windy). So the canopy alone makes this worth it.So things we really like:-When you extend the canopy part if it is mesh and the baby can see out (not as claustrophobic)-The peek window rolls towards me and has a velcro closure to keep it open. Very useful.-We like the soft cup holder, better than a hard tray.-We like the padding on the shoulder straps (though they get wet as baby teethed on them).-We like the zippered storage container by the handlebars (great for sunglasses).-It folds pretty flat.-Very smooth ride. (quiet too, nothing rattles).-The brake system and pedal are nice too. It's not the cheap kind of brakes on cheaper Gracos.It was easier that other Graco strollers to put together (just click the wheels on and put the cupholder bar and tray on).Also it seems like a tall stroller (both for baby and us). The handle bar is higher and we think it'll be useful for many years as baby grows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8IGQJV1PKCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PX8PCSO#wasThisHelpful","RO8IGQJV1PKCJ","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like other Thule products, it's expensive but worth it.I'm in the camp of buy something once, what I mean is I'd rather buy something expensive once instead of buying cheap stuff over and over again.This bag is not too big (it's quite compact). You can fit a laptop in it (but I get some sort of sleeve for it).It provides great protection for your expensive electronics; form-fitting padding holds 3 GoPro cameras, 2 extra batteries, 2 SD cards, and more.I really like that you can remove the foam padding from the crush-proof compartment and rinse/clean it.Pretty cool that it allows you to âwearâ 2 cameras at once - one facing forward and one facing backward.The size is nice - big enough for all of your GoPro stuff as well as a few other items while not being too bulky.There are multiple ways to wear it - it has a hideaway detachable waist belt. There are also 2 compression straps on either side of the main body to adjust its size - helps keep your stuff from rattling around inside. It even has 2 hydration ports for if you choose to carry a hydration reservoir (not included) and a clip to attach the reservoir to inside.It has a pouch lined with some sort of felty material to ensure your cell phone does not sustain scratches.Several netted compartments inside the main body of the backpack as well as in the GoPro storage area. There are also side storage pockets as well as zippered pockets in the waistbelt.Very well padded for extra comfort. Zipper pulls are covered in a blue plastic coating that creates loops that are easy to use with one hand and ensure they last.It is extremely well though out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQIKIHIYMLPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI4KEUG#wasThisHelpful","R1WQIKIHIYMLPB","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this may be a ""classic toy"" and ""great for imaginative play"", it is very cheaply constructed. I really donât expect this to last the week.The 24 play food items are actually kinda comical. They include: one bunch of carrots, a wedge of cheese, a bunch of purple grapes, a red apple, some sort of poultry (maybe a cornish game hen, since it is the same size as the apple), a six-pack of eggs, and 13 boxed items (including 2 half gallons of milk, three boxes of raisins, three boxes of rice, two boxes of laundry soap, and three boxes of cereal.) The carrots, cheese, grapes, apple and poultry are roughly the same size and made of somewhat sturdy plastic. I am sure if stepped on by an adult they would become misshapen, but should be pretty kid safe. The six eggs arenât quite as sturdy, which might actually make the more realistic!The shopping cart itself is quite easy to put together, but is made of pretty cheap plastic. While it can hold the included plastic perishables and empty boxes, it will not stand up to much realistic play.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4T6V2JKEZ6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM0HY9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2S4T6V2JKEZ6R","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like that I can use any bag I want in this pail - I absolutely hate purchasing a product and then having to keep buying stuff to use it (e.g., specific bags for a specific diaper pail).I really like the childproof safety locking mechanism to ensure baby (and/or pet) doesnât get into the diaper pail. I do miss the âfoot pedal-controlled opening mechanismâ, but am fine with trading it for the lock - I donât want to have to clean diapers and their contents from my daughterâs room or around the house! I also appreciate that you can leave the locking mechanism unlocked if you like to live on the edge or your baby isnât mobile yet.             The pail is quite compact and slim - doesnât take up too much room but holds a lot of diapers. (I used 35 - 40 size 4 Kirklands)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Easy to load - just tuck the top edges of the garbage bag around the bag holder - making sure to place part of the bag between the bag holder and its attached clip. Once loaded correctly, it allows for an airtight seal when you close the pail. There is also an airtight seal around the little opening on top for the diaper.The only time an odor is detected is when you put a diaper in or when you are changing the bag. I donât see an issue with this because with every diaper pail I have used, there is an odor when it is open. When the Ubbi is properly closed, there is no odor. Also, the Ubbi is made of steel so it doesnât absorb any odors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10TCBZFYZKJQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00821FLT4#wasThisHelpful","R10TCBZFYZKJQD","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very excited to try this, but I'm somewhat disappointed.- ""No tools"" means we included the wrenches. It should be ""tools included"".- It feels very cheap. The plastic rings between the different sections are very cheap, fragile, and move around with the curtain rings.- I didn't use a measuring tape as the instructions indicated: It wanted me to measure the distance between the walls and set it up 0.25 inches smaller so I can tighten it by hand later. This is impossible to do because getting the angle of the end piece depends on 2 rods.It's better to just try to adjust it between the 2 walls and then insert the screws to set the length.-Oh by setting the length, I mean insert and tighten 2 screws on the bottom of the rods so that the screws deform the inner rods and lodge themselves in there.The good things.It works well.It's very secure.It looks ok.It does give you a little more room.We use the outer rod for towels and save some space in the bathroom.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N106NCWKHGSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92QI3K#wasThisHelpful","R1N106NCWKHGSX","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like the shape of the tip and that you definitely canât put it too far into babyâs nose but get a great fit for better suction.I also like that you can use this product with the tubing and mouth piece or as a bulb aspirator.Appreciate that the bulb can be taken apart for better cleaning and that it is transparent - you can see if there is gunk inside that needs to be cleaned. Also, you can see what you have sucked from babyâs nose - gross but we are all curious.It is made from material that can be easily disinfected in the microwave or on the stovetop.The only thing I donât like is that the directions state that the filter cannot be used more than once - it is disposable and thus you have to keep buying them. It comes with 7 filters but thatâs not very many if your baby has a typical cold that lasts several days.Has a weird/kinda nasty taste from the rubber tubing.Like that you canât accidentally blow in babyâs nose - there is a one-way valve to prevent this. 4 stars because of the need to keep buying filters.Â Â ","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG21D1SZY0KAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P38Q9TU#wasThisHelpful","RG21D1SZY0KAW","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good shaver if these types of shavers work for you.This is the 7000 series. It's cheaper than the 9000 series.

"I have never used LeapFrog products.

The Kindergarten one had tedious tasks (making the bed, picking the right breakfast etc).I like when the education subjects are numbers/letters.The prices in the ""app store"" were reasonable (more reasonable than cartridges).It is a little bit slow.I didn't like that I had to agree to a privacy thing.I like the parental controls.I like the hardware, it is very sturdy.The camera is fun.So my advice is a very unhelpful: I don't know.I feel OK letting my kid play with it unattended. I don't know if I would have bought it if I got a chance to play with it yet.For example, I played with the PetPadParty app that's included.

"This is a fine, well balanced chef's knife.It is very slightly blade heavy.The spine is one of the thickest I've seen.The important thing is that it feel pretty good in the hand. And it's sharp out of the box.When cutting with a rocking motion, something is odd with the curvature. If you are near the tip it's fine, but when the handle is close to the cutting board it wants to stop rocking (the blade not curved near the base). Of the several chef's knives I have, this is the only one like that. It's not bad, I just don't like it.Also it is made in China, just FYI.I guess the number of stars this knife gets really depends on the price. I can get a swiss-made chef's knife for about $40.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4IAJ9GBML4BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFEDEVY#wasThisHelpful","R4IAJ9GBML4BM","ACSX5AIZE3MJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACSX5AIZE3MJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want a cart cover, this is pretty good.I say ""if"" because I don't think it's a necessity. My wife does.You have to buckle a few straps to the cart and then buckle the baby in so consider that every time to want to use it.The pouches and toys are a nice touch, and I like that if folds into it's own pouch for portability.It is a nice product and it is soft.

"I received this in exchange for my honest review. It does stop my dog from barking, but I've used other bark collars that I like better. This doesn't have an on/off switch, so the only way to save the battery is to remove it. The prongs are also narrower and therefore sharper than prongs on other bark collars I've used. I think this is probably fine if it's what you can afford, and it should be perfectly safe for most dogs.

"Shea butter is not a lotion.  It's actually a fat extracted from the nut of the African shea tree, and it melts at body temperature. So it's really thick, almost solid, just like a chunk of hard table butter. You can't scoop it up in your fingers - you have to kind of dig it out. Then you have to rub it in for a while to let it melt and absorb into your skin.But this really works. It makes my skin very soft.

"When I received this, I couldn't believe how small the package was! This is a full-sized hammock which folds into its own carrying pouch. The pouch is part of the hammock itself, so you can never lose it. It would be nothing to add this to a load in a backpack.The hammock comes with attached carabiner clips and strong nylon rope so you can hang it between two trees. I hung it on my porch instead, using large eye sockets and two huge carabiners that I picked up for a couple of dollars at a big box store.It's made of parachute-type material which seems to be very strong. I am a very large person and I feel surprisingly secure when I lie in it.This isn't the type of hammock with flat sides that stretch it out like a bed; this is a ""hang it between a couple of trees and let it wrap around your whole body"" hammock.

"This is wonderful. I spend my summers in bare feet and flip flops, so I have very thick, rough callouses on my feet. This removed them.I've tried using a dremel to do this in the past, but it was tedious and sometimes painful. This was simple and fast. The wide sanding roller prevents me from going too deep in one place, and immensely speeds up the process.My only concern is that since my callouses tend to be so thick, I may have to replace the roller heads a lot. The kit comes with one extra, but I also found them on Amazon for between $3 and  $7 each.I received this in exchange for my honest review, and I'm glad I got it.

"I purchased this primarily to replace my collapsable box grater because I wanted something that was smaller and easier to clean.This is definitely easier to clean. The blades are ""wedges"" instead of the ""pyramids"" on my box grater, if that makes any sense. So it's easy to turn this one over and wipe it clean. And of course this is smaller than a box grater, but I still wish it was about half the size it is. The blade is about 8: long, but lemons and limes are pretty small. Kitchen drawer space comes at a premium in our house, so I'm not thrilled when gadgets are oversized for no real reason.As some have mentioned, the blades are very sharp and could be dangerous, but it's not a problem for me because I have some cut-resistant gloves similar to these: NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves - High Performance Level 5 Protection, Food Grade.

"This was effective at removing the pet stain, but difficult to use. The directions require you to dilute the urine by pouring 4-6oz. of water on your carpet to dilute the stain before using this product. That's really a pain, and you're left with a saturated carpet.

"This seemed like a great product, it was really fun at first. But when we went to charge it, the charging plug was bent out of shape. In the process of trying to make it work, the whole plug broke off inside the scooter so we could no longer charge it. We returned it and that was a very bad experience, but since distributors change on this so often I'll leave that in seller feedback.

"I love this little bluetooth speaker, its a perfect size and i love the added features.PROS:1. Cool night light to keep the boogie man away. Has 4 intensity setting which is perfect for getting the right light to sleep with.2. Bluetooth and also supports TF cards which is good is u want to just slide in ur fav jams from your card.3. Sleep mode is also a cool feature that turns the light off, great for kids,.4. Alarm clock is a cool bonus not in most bluetooth speakers.5. Pairs pretty fast with my ipod touch 5 and kindle tablet.6. Has a clock, this little speaker seems to have it all.CONS:1. Sounds could have been a bit louder with more bass.All in all this is a perfect little speaker to have in your night stand next to your bed and also perfect for kids. It might not be the loudest sounding but with all the features it has it is a great little speaker. I paid more for a basic bluetooth speaker that has no features at all, sounds nice but no features. This one has so many little features that its great and im keeping it next to my bed.

No bass, the speakers volume is decent but there is almost no bass to it.2. No instructions which could have been useful for some.3.

"I have never tried Seoul foods so i was very interested in trying this book out and learning about Seoul cuisine.I have had this book for about 3 weeks now and tried a few recipes. 1 i didnt like but 2 were pretty refreshing and interestingly unique and thats what i wanted to experience.The book itself first takes you through some Korean food culture before stepping into the recipes. The recipes are pretty interesting ranging from stocks, sauces, appetizers, soups, stews, rice, noodles, fish, sweets and some unique items i have yet to try.The recipes are very easily shown with a short introduction into the dish. One thing the book lacks is PHOTOS, when it comes to cook books i think they should all have photos and all the recipes should have photos as a guide. When cooking someone else recipes i want to know if mine turned out like the authors finished product and not being able to see  the finish recipes. Being able to compare finished recipes is a great way to know if i done it correctly.All in all even with the lack of photos i ALWAYS enjoy a new cookbook.

"I had this rice cooker for about a month now and tried cooking with it 4 times. First once i did some rice,.,, you have to make sure you dont leave it in too long and use the exact measurements for it to come out right. It can go either way easy, over cook it or burn it. The rice did take a bit longer than i would have liked so the next couple of times i used to to make some stews and chili and worked better for those than it did the rice.The machine looks great and the digital controls worked as they should. The lid closes tight BUT if you put too much water it is IT CAN overflow which is a bad thing when its such hot water inside. I received mine for free to test it and give it an honest unbiased review and its a decent cooker.If you are new to slow cookers or rice cookers i would advice trying one a bit more simple to us and i would also recommend this machine more for stews, chilies and things of that nature as it worked great for those. Just make sure you dont over fill it with fluids to avoid overflowing when the water boils.

I have had a few times where the bait is missing and trap not sprung.FIX: I recommend you using a liquid bait like miracle whip, they love it and its a great way to stop them from taking the bait and running.

" 9:28 Mins I love this little camera. I been using it for a while now and its been nice to have it. I replaced another IP surveillance camera with this one because the other IP camera had to go wired through an Ethernet cable to my modem which made it annoying to have to run a 100 foot Ethernet cable from that camera to my modem.This one is great because it is TRULY wifi and super easy to install as my video shows how fast i got it up and going.Once you have it paired to your device, put the camera where you want and you can check on the camera feed through your smart device anytime. I have mine over my front there and now every time someone rings the door bell i can take my ipod touch and check to see who is ringing and either hide or open the door lol.ONE thing.. if you have a low wifi signal the camera might disconnect and connect. Also if your camera is far from your wifi modem then it might also do the same a bit.I have a strong signal at my house and also have wifi extenders that boost the signal near the camera so i dont have that problem. I do use mine to watch live stream and that to me is whats best for.If you want to record video or take photos you can but you will need something with a lot of memory to store all that footage. You can take photos and store them on your device and even short video recordings. I did not use it with my laptop so i cant say how good it can record through your laptop but it should be about the same.Unless you have a security setup that can record all the video with no problem i mostly recommend it for live feeds. Keep an eye out on your property, front door to see who is ringing/knoking, see who is coming and going, check up on the baby.. stuff like that is great.For the price it is a decent IP wifi camera that works. Its not a high prices surveillance system so you cant expect that. I was lucky enough to get mine free to test at home and give it an honest unbiased review and for me its great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R398E1KHBOHNCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N05T2S#wasThisHelpful","R398E1KHBOHNCE","A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the first model NOT the MP018 model.Ok i have had this for a while now and used it in a few occasions and loved it. I have mine connected with an HDMI cable to my tv and used a 32gb sony sd card and also a external USB flash-drive and in both occasions worked perfectly.I was able to use the controller to work through the photos or video that were in the card and drive and all worked smoothly. The video quality was good and the pictures looked as good.Im not sure what others might have experienced but for me i had no problems, right out the box i had it going. Pretty simple to install, just plug an HDMI to the back of it and then to your tv and plug the device in to the wall outlet and done.Comes with remote and also AV cables which i did not use.Its pretty much like taking a tv with no USB or SD card slots and giving your tv more inputs. I love being able to transfer a movie from my computer to a flash drive and now having my tv be able to play them.I was lucky to get mine for free to test it at home and give it an honest unbiased review and after about a month of use i love it, worked great for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAA0U5ZLUOPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8Q5ZGE#wasThisHelpful","RYAA0U5ZLUOPB","A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a few selfie sticks and they all pretty much all work the same and all do the job as intended. What u have to look for is what will make the selfie stick stand out and better help you and this selfie stick is great for those needing a TINY selfie stick.The selfie stick paired up fast to my device and worked as expected, the winning feature here is the size. This selfie stick is very small and great for taking it with you on locations where you dont want to walk around carrying a large one.This thing folds up to a pretty small size that can easily fit in your pocket, purse...ANYWHERE. I love how i can just stuff it in my pocket and go, that is the one feature that selfie stick is great at.

"This is a pretty cool gadget, its pretty much a 8gb external flash-drive or a cool what i call spy recorder. Super easy to use by just clicking the on/off button to record and you can record a few hours of sound.Couple things to know is i recommend you charging the device for a bit before use and also the sound files come out as WAV. so make sure your audio program can play wav. files.After that its pretty simple, click on and it will automatically record. I actually set it on a table next to my bed and recorded myself sleeping to test it and it worked. I had hours of me making all kinds of weird sounds as i slept lol.

"If you have an action camera like a GoPro or the similar ones out in the market this kit is great for you. This thing is huge and comes with almost everything you need to get started.Main pieces...- Chest piece which is great for getting running or walking shots. Surfing and other shots from a chest perspective.- Head piece great for biking shots and shots above your torso with a clean high view.- Tripod is decent and comes in handy for hand free recording on top of a table or something.- Suction cup stand for recording from a car is great.- Selfie stick that can always come in handy to get those cool shots.- Carrying case of course is great to put in your favorite pieces, camera and you are ready to go.Thats just a few to name some but this kit has tons of stuff. Other clams, joints, extenders and tons more that i dont even know what they are for.CONS:- The packaging is a bit wild, just tons and tons of stuff thrown inside the carry case. When you open it, it almost explodes all those goodies all over the place. Could have been packaged better but for me i was fine with it.- No instructions or diagrams so if you are new to action cams you might feel overwhelmed by so many pieces and not know what to do with them. Proper instructions and diagrams on how to use each piece would have been extremely helpful.All in all those 2 cons dont bother me much as this is an extremely huge kit and was perfect for me to get started with. I recently got an action cam and need to get some accessories and this kit came out great for me.I was lucky to receive mine for free to test the kit and each piece and give it an honest review and i like it, has come flaws but man do u get a lot of goodies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6V8BXJN1E52M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5CGY74#wasThisHelpful","R6V8BXJN1E52M","A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few of these usb hubs to charge my devices and this one has replaced them all. I love that it has so many ports with different power outputs to charge smaller to bigger usb devices. Most of my older ones have 4-5 ports and i still need some spots for more. With so many devices like cellphone, ipod touch, tablets and other usb gadgets this came in extremely handy because now i can plug in all my devices at once over night and have them all charged in the morning when im ready to go.It also has a nice off/on button on the back that other usb ports dont which can come in handy. This to me is just a beast for people that are highly tech savvy and have tons of gadgets. I used to have TWO 4 port chargers running at once and this 10 port has made it a lot more convenient.I have been charging my ipod touch, kindle tablet, asus tablet, bluetooth speakers and a few other gadgets and all have charged quickly with no problems.

" 5:07 Mins I have had my oil diffuser for a while now and its great, so far i have had no problems with it.The unit comes with power cable, instruction booklet, small cup for pouring water and the unit.Super easy to set up and control with the touch screen buttons in the front of unit. Its really use to remove lid and pour the water(up to 500 ml) and can run for up to 10 hours which is great.Has 3 dimmer settings for light, 2 intensity settings for mist, on/off and light on/off touch buttons on the front.If i had to give it one negative is that i dont know how to change the color of light and its not in the instructions. WHEN i do get that info ill edit this review and add how to change the colors.All in all as the video shows, its a great unit and i have had it for over a month now with no problems.

" 9:07 Mins I received this little guy as a gift for my birthday since they knew i love star wars and its a hot item to have for star wars fans and i love it BUT there are drawbacks for other people that might buy him that are not so much into being collectors or star wars fans.Who is this for?I would say this droid is a MUST have for any tech fans, robot fans, droid fans, toy collectors and of course star wars fans. Me being all the above i love this little guy. Its a very cute design, nice packaging, cute sounds, very tech friendly and fun to play with. Any toy, tech or star wars collector would love this little guy in their collection as much as i do.Who is this NOT for?I would not recommend this for kids or casual toy buyers. Though its cute it is very limiting not offering kids anything special except for the cuteness and there is a better option out there for kids that comes with a remote control and no need for smart device/app to control it. Being also very limited it can get boring fast so someone picking him up for the fun of it will be bored with it pretty fast.What do i like about it?Well i love the star wars factor of it. I love most things star wars so i guess that makes me a bit bias when it comes to it. I do love the uniqueness of it with the head almost floating from his body. He can also be a bit fun to control and play with at times and looks great as a nice display/conversation piece. I love how fast it paired to my device and how easy it was to control and get a hang of all the features. I think most people will easily pick up how to control it and have a blast. The hologram messaging is also a pretty awesome feature to have and play with.What do i dislike about it?It is very limiting, there are 3 main features only. Drive it, like it roam around on its own and the virtual messaging system. Two of them gets boring pretty fast and not so fun to use anymore. Controlling him is pretty fun but not much to do there. There is also the voice commands but again there are only a few and kinda are very similar to each other so not much there either. There are also a lack of instructions which would have been a bit more helpful to have. The booklet included should have went more in-depth with full instructions.Hopefully with an update if possible he can receive more voice commands to play with and features. As a star wars tech guy i love him and im glad to include him in my collection.As an adult i would not buy this for kids, i would buy the kids the remote controlled version instead as it is cheaper and will provide kids the same about of fun without having to deal with an app or smartphone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REOD7S439H5HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107H5FJ6#wasThisHelpful","REOD7S439H5HA","A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What makes this selfie stick stand out is the remote control button that lets u use it as more than a selfie stick. You can get some nicer shots not having to hold the stick.

"I saw reviews where others received this kit in exchange for a review so I was a bit hesitant but im glade I decided to go ahead and get this.The shears are very sharp and made in simple to make small precise snips. I needed that !The coil jig is simple and makes a perfect coil everytime.The ohm meter is spot on with readings.The pliers and wire cutters are high quality and solid.The 2 in 1 screw driver is very handy and although most mods and RDA/RTA untis come with mini screw drivers this comes in handy.The bamboo mat is a nice thoughtful inclusion and does a good job keeping the area clean.Im new to building coils , I have been vaping for 7 years, and this has everything I needed. My first build went flawless. What more can you ask for?The tools are of good quality and the case is great for keeping everything together. Good kit. I would recommend to anyone wanting an all in one kit for building and testing coil builds.Buying these things seperately wouldnt cost too much more but the fact that this is in a case with lots of room for my extras makes this a great overall value and very convenient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA2B72LSFHAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKC9XG2#wasThisHelpful","RUA2B72LSFHAY","A1LFYHJAG0X6EH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LFYHJAG0X6EH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Melatonin is Melatonin right? Well, sure, but this product is exceptional. Melatonin is best taken in the dark 30 minutes before you sleep. The reason you should take in the dark is because light entering your eyes destroy Melatonin. This product slowly dissolves under your tongue and enters the blood stream for even faster uptake when compared to ordinary tabs. These taste very pleasant so you get to enjoy a nice flavor before dozing off.You get 5mg which is really high dose (Effective Doses can be as little as 1mg) and you can split these in half. The fact that you get 250 of these at 5mg means that if you split them in half you get 500 nights worth which is an incredible value. Natrol is a high quality company with quality control standards which means you get whats on the label.How can you go wrong with this deal?

"We just had our first a few months ago and were looking for a mirror for the back seat. I was able to get this product at a discount for my honest review - and here it is: It works well.It came quickly and was easy to set up. We installed it in my wife's Corolla and it took less than 5 minutes. It feels like it is attached well to the headrest and doesn't bounce around while driving. The mirror is crystal clear and large enough to see with minimal effort. It is nice to be able to see the baby while driving and I know it makes my wife more at ease with driving him around.

"I purchased the SO&CO New York Men's 5006A.1 Monticello watch at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and I really like this watch.It arrived quickly (which is always nice) and the first thing I noticed was how nice the packaging was â so much so, I took a picture of it for yâall to see below. The watch was protected from scratches during shipping with the clear thin plastic that is easy to peel off.Once I removed the protective wrapping from the watch, I was impressed with how great it looks. Initially, I was confused as to how I opened the watch band, but figured it out pretty quickly. The mesh band looks great and is easy to adjust for a perfect fit â without having to hammer out any band pins.The watch face is a beautiful and dark black, which really makes the silver and white on the face pop. The instructions are clear on how to set the time and change the date. The buttons above and below the adjustment knob advance the day and date respectively and the time is easy to change. The watch comes with a small piece of plastic placed on the adjustment knob so that the battery isnât running before you get it. It is nice to know that I will have the whole life of the battery.I have been wearing the watch for about a week now and I am really pleased with it. So far, it has kept excellent time and looks great for casual use or for work, which is where I wear it most. I have attached some pictures to try and show you how nice this watch is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14OD2NB8CNOR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXWRUCO#wasThisHelpful","R14OD2NB8CNOR0","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a Stuhrling Original Men's 665B.02 watch at a discount for my honest and unbiased reviewâ¦and here it is. I think that this is a very nice looking watch at an excellent price.I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the (well packed) box to find high quality packaging. It is clear to me that they take pride in their products as everything was padded and all parts of the watch were wrapped with protective plastic to prevent scratches. The box is quite nice and reminds me of a high end scotch box. The warranty and registration information come in the box and are straightforward.After removing the protective wrapping from the watch, I was struck by how nice it looks â the pictures really donât do it justice. The watch face is a beautiful and dark black, which really makes the silver colored numbers and dials pop. The band comes with extra links, so it is quite large until you resize it â which is pretty easy to do. The watch came with the proper time already set; I just had to adjust the date, which is easy enough to doâ¦especially after reading the instructions (you donât have to spin the dial to set the date) which is nice.The watch band does feel light, but I wouldnât necessarily call it cheap feeling as some of the other reviews have. I actually prefer a lighter band as it keeps the watch from âflopping aroundâ on my wrist like some of my other heavier banded watches. I tested the chrono and chrono reset features and all worked flawlessly. I have been wearing the watch for about a week now and I am really pleased with it. So far, it has kept excellent time and looks great for casual use or for work, which is where I wear it most.

Changing the baby is challenging enough and I can assure you that we have put these to the test with LOTS of fluids of varying types and they do not leak through. They are super absorbent and the backing is completely waterproof. We also put them under the baby in the crib to keep the occasional night blowout contained and not have to do more laundry than we already do. While we use these for the baby, I have no doubt that they would be perfect for pets and incontinence as well. I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review - and I 100% WILL be buying more when we run through these. I am thrilled to have pads that actually work, it makes life with the baby so much more convenient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2183PR51O378O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X2W7GVY#wasThisHelpful","R2183PR51O378O","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I jumped at the chance to provide an honest review for a discounted product. I absolutely love this thermometer. Somehow I have made it this far without one and usually end up burning everything I cook - I try to get it well done enough and go too far. This makes it simple, especially with the included temperature chart.You can tell that it is well designed and is made with care.

"I spent 8 years in the Army as a tanker/Cav scout and wearing rings was something that we were all always worried about. Working out or working around that kind of machinery while wearing a metal ring can ""deglove"" or remove your finger if it is caught. This silicone ring fits me perfectly and doesn't fall off in water like my cobalt right. I use this for working out or whenever I need to do something that I don't want to lose/dirty up my regular ring....like yard work, swimming, or working around machinery.It is stylish and subdued at the same time and I don't worry about the safety of my finger while working out. I highly recommend this if you want to still wear a ring while being active and not have to worry about losing or damaging your ring...or your finger.

"I received this cable and was immediately impressed with the quality and fit/finish. The connectors are a beautiful silver and gold and the jacket is shiny and gray. It is rigid and still flexible and the connectors came with covers to protect them during shipment. The cable shipped securely in a bag and the cable itself has twist ties to keep it wound properly.I ended up using this cable to run from my wall-mounted TV to my receiver, which included running it through holes drilled in the drywall. Usually this process is a HUGE pain, but with this stiffer cable, I was able to easily work it from one hole to the other. The signal quality is fantastic, my HD looks amazing - and of course the TV does most of that heavy lifting but having 4K HDMI helps a ton.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNO0OVPA80P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6XJQWK#wasThisHelpful","R2UNO0OVPA80P0","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a Stuhrling Original Men's 665B.02 watch at a discount for my honest and unbiased reviewâ¦and here it is. I think that this is a very nice looking watch at an excellent price.I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the (well packed) box to find high quality packaging. It is clear to me that they take pride in their products as everything was padded and all parts of the watch were wrapped with protective plastic to prevent scratches. The box is quite nice and reminds me of a high end scotch box. The warranty and registration information come in the box and are straightforward.After removing the protective wrapping from the watch, I was struck by how nice it looks â the pictures really donât do it justice. The watch face is a beautiful and dark blue which really makes the silver colored numbers and dials pop. The band comes with extra links, so it is quite large until you resize it â which is pretty easy to do. The watch came with the proper time already set; I just had to adjust the date, which is easy enough to doâ¦especially after reading the instructions (you donât have to spin the dial to set the date) which is nice.The watch band does feel light, but I wouldnât necessarily call it cheap feeling as some of the other reviews have. I actually prefer a lighter band as it keeps the watch from âflopping aroundâ on my wrist like some of my other heavier banded watches. I tested the chrono and chrono reset features and all worked flawlessly. I have been wearing the watch for about a week now and I am really pleased with it. So far, it has kept excellent time and looks great for casual use or for work, which is where I wear it most.  I have attached some pictures to try and show you how nice this watch is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGEH4KDG5KMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB1Z3KO#wasThisHelpful","R2XGEH4KDG5KMH","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I actually bought it for my wife who just had our first baby. She was thrilled and absolutely loves it. She uses it on her face and stretch marks from the pregnancy and couldn't be happier.You can tell that the roller is quality by the packaging and overall fit and finish of the roller. I haven't tried it, but she says that it doesn't hurt at all and is really good for the skin. We have had it for about a week now and she continues to use it every day and feels like it is already reducing her fine lines. She cleans it every night with alcohol to keep it sterile, which is one of the initial concerns I had - but it is all good. She has also told me that her skin tone already looks more even.Thankfully, I did well with this one.

"I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion...and I am glad I did. Whenever I had been working out, I have been putting my phone upside down in an old armband I had used in the Army to hold my ID card overseas. The Flexion is amazing. It fits my iPhone perfectly, the touchscreen works through the plastic, there is no way it is falling out, and it has a hole for headphones (if you don't have bluetooth). I have yet to run with it, but I also like to have music while doing yardwork and this has made it a breeze.It has not slipped or fallen down my arm once, no matter what kind of bending, lifting, or twisting I do. The material is neoprene and is soft, stretchy, and super comfortable. It is machine washable which is a plus and has a lifetime warranty.

"I spent 8 years in the Army and this is the same type of material that we used as the good 'ol PT belt. This harness is excellent for providing visibility in low light situations and is extremely comfortable.

I also like how it provides a lot of visibility without the weight or discomfort of a full on vest.While it stretches easily, it feels sturdy and secure and I am confident it will last for a long time.

"I am an avid wine, whiskey, and beer drinker and absolutely love these things. You can keep your drink cold without ruining it by watering it down. I have used these in scotch/bourbon, white wine, and a beer that I left out just long enough to get warm and I am impressed at how quickly they cooled the drinks down and how long they stayed cold. I didn't notice any flavor changes either, which is important.As for the product itself...make sure you wash everything when you get it. That should go without saying, but do it. The soapstone had some dust that got on the stainless cubes as well. No big deal, just wash. I like the fact that it has a tray that can easily fit in any freezer and keeps everything together and away from touching something that might get into your drink.If you are a drinker who likes to keep their booze cold without watering it down, I highly recommend this combo set. 4 of each is enough to keep a couple in your drink and a couple in the freezer - and you can switch them out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRQLUMU3E8J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUELMMS#wasThisHelpful","R2HRQLUMU3E8J8","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review - so here it is.This portable charger is pretty cool. I left my charger at home and my phone got down to about 3% at work today. I plugged it in and it started charging right away and started charging quickly. It is worth noting that I had not yet plugged it in, I just opened the package and plugged it in - so they ship it with a charge.I wasn't sure how I would feel about a bracelet for a portable charger, but it is easy to still use the phone while charging. The way it was designed allows for a natural grip on the phone without the charger getting in the way or falling off of your lap, table, etc.The bracelet comes with a charging cable with USB to Micro USB. You can charge the bracelet via a wall wort or your computer's USB port. It also comes with a Micro USB to Micro USB cable with an attached lightning adapter. The product description incorrectly lists it as a mini USB when it is in fact, a micro. So this will work with iPhones and other Samsung, LG, etc. phones with a micro USB.You can tell that this is water resistant, it has a smooth black silicone-like cover over the internal battery segments. The only thing keeping this from being totally waterproof is the flap that covers the micro USB input. When closed, I have faith that normal use and light splashing won't damage this - just don't go swimming with it and be careful while washing your hands.The bracelet charges your phone pretty quickly and charges up when connected to a USB port fairly quickly too. FYI, your phone charged much more quickly when you turn off WiFi and Bluetooth. I turn them off before connecting to the charger and just let it sit and do its thing for a while. It takes a couple presses/a long press of the top button to start charging your phone, but you can feel the phone vibrate or make noise when it starts getting power from the bracelet.Overall, this is a fantastic idea and is executed well. I like the ergonomics of being able to use my phone while charging it. If I am at my desk, I can just leave the bracelet flat out on the table while charging and put it on if I need to be mobile. If you are looking for a mobile charger for your phone, I recommend considering this - it is well made, convenient, and well thought out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MNAT1XBAFLL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNSF84S#wasThisHelpful","R2MNAT1XBAFLL3","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is a life saver. We were out of ground coffee and only had beans...but no grinder, and I was able to get this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This little guy came through and easily ground through the beans that we threw at it. The nice thing about a manual grinder like this is that you are able to control how coarse/fine the grind is.One thing to note, I do not think these are dishwasher safe. I washed it by hand as soon as I received it, but make sure that you wash it by hand - it is easy enough to do as it is so compact and you don't want to risk ruining it! It is quiet and easy to grind small amounts for maximum coffee freshness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQLTCBD57160/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUCOZJ0#wasThisHelpful","RDQLTCBD57160","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many other reviewers, I tested this with a piece of paper as I didn't want to risk the phone in case it didn't work. I am happy to report that it did in fact work - it is totally waterproof.It is large enough to fit my iPhone5s and had plenty of room if I wanted to throw some other things like keys in there. The touch screen was easy to use through the plastic. One thing to consider is that water does get in-between the plastic tabs so you have to make sure you are careful when you open it up and remove your phone.I think that this is great solution for keeping your phone dry if you are going to be around water.

"I bought this to spray our back patio and I am impressed with the power. I used it on stained concrete and it worked so well, it blasted the stain off. The 2 nozzles easily handle anything I have thrown at it (concrete, siding, my cars) and it performs like a champ.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a pain to set up and break down. The holders in the back dont grip the wands very well, so they are always falling off. Everything is tedious to set up and break down. Other than that minor issue, the pressure washer performs quite well.

My old HDMI cable would have been too short to use, but thankfully this came with one that is nice and long.Look at the price/features of other brands and you would be surprised.

"My wife and I were moving and our old vacuum had been losing suction for quite some time. We moved into a house and the previous owners had dogs. The house smelled like dog. The wife was using a carpet cleaner and it kept pulling up hair clumps and getting stuck. We vacuumed with the old vacuum and cleaned the carpet with an upright cleaner with solution 3 times. I decided on this model since we have 2 cats and anxiously waited for its arrival. The wife wasn't happy with the price, but hey you get what you pay for. As soon as it arrived, we had it assembled within 10 minutes and started to vacuum the old carpet.This is where I fell in love with this vacuum:The amount of dust, dirt, sand, hair, and other stuff that came out of the carpet of ONE ROOM was unbelievable. Even after several cleanings and a few passes with the old vacuum, the amount that was left behind was disgustingly unbelievable. We used it on the rest of the carpets with the same result. The once overpowering dog smell had been removed. The wife was an immediate convert. We have been using this a couple of times a week and we are still amazed at how much it pulls out of the carpets.The attachments and tools that come with this version are invaluable. The cats like to chill on the microfiber couches, but a little attention with the attachments easily takes care of that. It is easy to empty the plastic bin and we do it every time just to see how much we are actually picking up when we use it.I have never been this excited about a vacuum...and I didnt know one could be excited about a vacuum.The only negatives that I can see with it are minor and have been discussed in other reviews:Tips over easilyRequires a bit of force to get that click when standing it uprightRequires full unwrapping of the cord to use the hose featureAll of these are minor. I am completely satisfied and I absolutely love this vacuum. I recommend it to anyone that will hear it, even if they are not pet owners. The price is up there, but the quality of the product is second to none. If you are in the market for a new vacuum, this one is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9LAFWK8FLIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SG536E#wasThisHelpful","R1H9LAFWK8FLIR","ATJQOAUHB5XB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJQOAUHB5XB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to replace an older model in our new home. I was able to install it quickly and easily.After getting it all set up and on the network (which was a breeze), I noticed that the AC would turn off after about 5 minutes of use. I did some more research and found that even though my old unit didnt need the common (blue) wire, this one did. After connecting the common wire, I have had ZERO problems with the nest and I am going to purchase another for the upstairs.The fit/finish of the unit is excellent. It looks awesome on the wall and it performs extremely well. I know for a fact that this is saving us on our energy bill because I would forget to change the temperature on the old upstairs thermostat and it would still be running where the Nest's auto-away feature would keep the down stairs off while I am at work. The mobile ap is straightforward, but I would like to see a little more functionality out of it. It is easy to change the temperature from anywhere and it isnt enough for me to dock a star.Awesome product, I will be buying another one, and I highly recommend it to all who are looking.

"While the Springfrield XD(m) series weapons come with a holster, the holster is incompatible with any add-on rail-mounted device.  The supplied holster also relies on friction for retention, which I've never quite been comfortable with.I own a tactical (thigh-mount) holster, as well, though it also isn't compatible with rail-mounted devices.  I far prefer that, and have used it largely exclusively until recently.My XD(m) has trijicon night sights installed, but I wanted the option of a laser-sight and/or tactical light.  I tried a guide-rod laser (a wonderful concept, but poorly executed, and thus largely useless, but the only option compatible with a standard holster, best suitable, really, for aligning the iron sights).  I have a boresight laser (which, unfortunately, does not work well with the XD(m)'s ejector mechanism, giving a false boresight location and thus being largely useless for this weapon).  So, I realized I needed a rail-mounted device.  Unfortunately, but inevitablly, this also means new holsters.So, I bought this as a replacement for the waistband holster provided by Springfield, and I absolutely LOVE it for that purpose.  While very slightly higher-profile than the stock holster, it is adjustable (to one of several different draw angles, using tools), is more comfortable at my waist, and most importantly of all, it has a mechanical latch which means that drawing is far easier than a ""friction-retained"" holster.  The latch is ideally located...  put your trigger finger on this latch, depress, draw, and your finger is properly located either for the ""safe hold"" position, in front of the trigger along the barrel slide direction (and on top of the activation button for the laser/light), or, very easily, right onto the trigger (if you're in a ""sudden action"" situation).I'm very, very happy with this holster for that reason.  But even better, this has a feature which will deactivate your Veridian sight when holstering your weapon, saving power, but (if holstered while active) will immediately return your firearm accessory to the same operating mode upon drawing the weapon.  It's really very convenient, unless you'd prefer to draw without anything on (in which case, just holster the weapon with the laser/light deactivated, and it will return to that same mode, of course).For this weapon/light combo, you don't have many options (I've also found a nylon fabric thigh-holster compatible with it, thankfully).  But the good thing is that this holster, along with this light, is a nearly perfect solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8U7T2DXH9OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MC44CC#wasThisHelpful","R1B8U7T2DXH9OR","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a pair of Databank watches for quite some time...  a 150 and a 300 version.  I made the fatal error of taking my 150 to a ""watch repair shop"" to get the battery changed, at some point, and then next time did it myself (as I usually do).  And I discovered that the repair shop had failed to replace the o-ring seal...  which I knew would eventually result in the watch failing.Well, recently, it did.  The 150's module is totally non-functional.  And my 300 is almost too valuable to wear anymore.  I wanted something new.  This watch is the last version which is (mostly) compatible with those earlier watched.  It comes in several variants, so I bought a silver one and a black one.  This review relates to both versions.This is a pretty decent watch, comparable to the older (and better) versions in most ways.  It has a lot less available data memory (which seems odd, doesn't it?) and no longer has the ""Indiglo"" electroluminescent backlight) which is wonderful, instead merely using white surface-mount LEDs to reflect light inside the case.  And, of course, it loses the ""countdown timer"" function (which I almost never used, anyway).But the calculator functionality is equivalent to, and in one way better, the earlier models.  This has a built-in ""currency conversion"" mode (really just a single memory which you can multiply your entries by) which does come in handy if you travel a lot.The ""dual time"" mode is less capable than the earlier version.  In that case, you'd set it based upon whatever time zone  you might be in, and you could step through timezones (say, from London to Cairo) without having to reset the time itself.  In this case, you simply have to reset the watch time for a second entry... not quite as nice.It does have a ""daylight savings time"" option which helps a bit, since you don't have to reset the watch twice a year (you only turn DST on or off).The reduced ""databank"" feature set means that you no longer have the calendar display at the top of the screen (which was nice... you'd see a darkened box on days when an event was set, or a blank if nothing was set).

"I've had a pair of Databank watches for quite some time...  a 150 and a 300 version.  I made the fatal error of taking my 150 to a ""watch repair shop"" to get the battery changed, at some point, and then next time did it myself (as I usually do).  And I discovered that the repair shop had failed to replace the o-ring seal...  which I knew would eventually result in the watch failing.Well, recently, it did.  The 150's module is totally non-functional.  And my 300 is almost too valuable to wear anymore.  I wanted something new.  This watch is the last version which is (mostly) compatible with those earlier watched.  It comes in several variants, so I bought a silver one and a black one.  This review relates to both versions.This is a pretty decent watch, comparable to the older (and better) versions in most ways.  It has a lot less available data memory (which seems odd, doesn't it?) and no longer has the ""Indiglo"" electroluminescent backlight) which is wonderful, instead merely using white surface-mount LEDs to reflect light inside the case.  And, of course, it loses the ""countdown timer"" function (which I almost never used, anyway).But the calculator functionality is equivalent to, and in one way better, the earlier models.  This has a built-in ""currency conversion"" mode (really just a single memory which you can multiply your entries by) which does come in handy if you travel a lot.The ""dual time"" mode is less capable than the earlier version.  In that case, you'd set it based upon whatever time zone  you might be in, and you could step through timezones (say, from London to Cairo) without having to reset the time itself.  In this case, you simply have to reset the watch time for a second entry... not quite as nice.It does have a ""daylight savings time"" option which helps a bit, since you don't have to reset the watch twice a year (you only turn DST on or off).The reduced ""databank"" feature set means that you no longer have the calendar display at the top of the screen (which was nice... you'd see a darkened box on days when an event was set, or a blank if nothing was set).  However, this is replaced by a LARGE text box which tells you the day of the week, so it's probably a improvement in the eyes of most people.The keypad is actually an improvement over the prior versions in terms of ease of pressing of the buttons.

The band itself is metal, but the case is silver-painted plastic (which is disappointing... I'm sure that eventually the case will become scratched and will look ugly after that point).  The band is pretty easy to use... a standard steel-link watch band...  but you may need to either figure out how to remove links or, more probably, get someone to do it for you.  Unless you're HUGE...  you can't wear it as-shipped.

"I had very high hopes for this...  conceptually, it's a wonderful idea.Unfortunately, the execution is terrible.  Not just ""poor"" but TERRIBLE.  I have removed this from my XDm, permanently.Why?Well, the existing guide rod is a consistent cylinder.  This is not... they make one size, it seems, and add ""adapter rings"" to the ends to fit different weapon guide rod sizes.  So, except at the far ends of the slide travel, the ""guide rod"" is LOOSE.  This results in some loss of accuracy and an increased probability of jamming.But worse, the part tends to rotate when in-place, rendering the (rather ingenious!) activation mechanism unworkable.  The first time I encountered this, I tried to field-strip the weapon, only to discover that (due to this same rotation issue) it became very, very difficult to disassemble the weapon.  I had to ""wiggle"" the rod from the front, to rotate it, until I was eventually able to rotate it back to the ""as designed"" position, at which point I could again disassemble the weapon.Now, had Lasermax actually put this into a dimensionally-accurate replica of the original Springfield guide rod, instead of ""shimming"" the two ends with add-on fittings, this would be the PERFECT laser sight for any XDm and I would recommend it unconditionally.But an add-on which (a) fails regularly, (b) increase the potential for weapon failure, and (c) makes field-stripping nearly impossible (""immediate action"" becomes a half-hour exercise in frustration!)...  is not something I would ever recommend anyone spend their money on.Lasermax, PLEASE develop a version of this using a dimensionally-accurate replica of the actual Springfield guide rod.  THAT would get a ""five star"" rating from me, without hesitation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3C014PW8SFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406SK2K#wasThisHelpful","R1W3C014PW8SFJ","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a NECESSARY addition to the 1:1000 ""Reliant"" kit sold by Polar Lights/Round 2.  In fact, it's really strange that the item was not included with the model (guess they're feeling the economic pinch like the rest of us are?)I was tempted to mark it down due to the above, but that's not really what ""reviews"" are for.  A review is there to discuss the product itself.  So while it may be reasonable to mark down the model (for not including the decals) it's not reasonable to mark down the decals themselves.These decals consist of supplementary decals to help you build the kit provided by Round 2.  Note that this is not a FULL decal set... those which are present in the main kit sheet are not necessarily duplicated here.  It contains two different things, really.1)  A whole set of different names and registry numbers.  The names and numbers provided are of ships seen on-screen...  other than the Reliant, which is on the original kit decal sheet.  Most of the ship names seen here are from episodes of ""Star Trek - The Next Generation"" or ""Star Trek - Deep Space Nine.""  One is from the film ""The Voyage Home.""So, you get some extra names...  but that's not really the ""big deal"" with this set, nor is it what I meant when I said ""this should have been included.""No, the other thing this contains is a complete set of very nice, pretty subtle ""aztec panel"" decals.  With only a very few exceptions, these decals cover every single exposed surface on the model (though they are very subtle and just ""shade"" the color of paint underneath, rather than covering it up, so you still need to paint!)For those unfamiliar, the term ""aztec"" is not a technical term.  Rather, it derives from how, on the first Movie Enterprise, the ship was painted with a beautiful, regular pattern, which (when looked at closely) resembled ancient Aztec heiroglyphics.  (Look closely at the upper hull of the Enterprise and you can see the little ""men"" on each major panel!)You don't want to put these over white paint, but rather over some nice, neutral grey color (say ""light ghost grey"").  They'll require decal setting solution and/or decal solvent in order to properly seat on the various curved surfaces, and once fully dry will require a clear over-coat paint to protect them (be careful with what you choose... some overcoatings yellow over time!)If you use them properly, the model will (at arms length) very, very closely resemble the ship as seen on-screen.  It's really wonderful to see.But in prior R2 kits, these have been ""in the box,"" and I wish R2 hadn't changed course on this particular model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5N2U1S9AIYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA3L1QI#wasThisHelpful","R1S5N2U1S9AIYU","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm the sort of consumer who buys ""really good"" equipment and then keeps it 'til it fails (or is rendered obsolete by conditions outside my ability to control).  So, when my last pair of nice, mid-range headphones died recently, I wanted to get something really nice.  These headphones were my choice to replace the old ones, based upon significant research on my part.First off...  yes, the stories  you've heard are true... these headphones really do have an extended ""break-in"" period (several days of steady use) before they sound as good as they ought to sound.  I knew this going in, but was still uneasy when I first tried them out and heard almost ""hollow and tinny"" sound.  Now that I've owned and used them for several weeks, the sound is truly wonderful, however... rich, full, and encompassing, with the best tonal accuracy I've heard on any set I've ever used.  I realize that there are better sets out there... but those sell for thousands of dollars, and honestly, I doubt I'd be able to tell the difference.These are definitely ""open"" which means that (given appropriate listening volume) you can hear things around you, and those around you can hear (at very reduced apparent volume) whatever you're listening to.  I don't mind that, but bear it in mind if you want to use them to listen in bed, for example, without disturbing the person next to you.  That's not going to happen.As for comfort...  I suppose those with very hard heads would find them uncomfortable at first.  My head isn't quite that large so I feel perfectly comfortable with them on for extended use.I've tried them on my Pioneer receiver in both ""pure direct"" playback mode and in ""headphones"" based modes... I strongly prefer the ""pure direct"" mode.  Any processed playback loses some fidelity... something I'd never noticed on my prior headphones but can definitely notice using these.I'm very satisfied.  They look nice, feel nice, and sound wonderful.  My only ""wish"" is that I would have preferred a longer cable... and I guess I need to get a high-end extension (which, despite what I've read, I doubt will harm my sound quality).

"I previously owned a rather cheap, but reliable, battery-operated sorter, (cylindrical in form) which was a gift from my mom, years ago.  When it failed, recently, I purchased what seemed to be the same unit...  but which was a piece of junk, and failed within two months.  So I decided to get a better one.  I chose this one.So far, I'm quite satisfied.  It's larger than the old one, and requires a power connection rather than batteries...  but it does nice things that the prior device I owned would not do (like count, stop at the end of filling a tube, etc).There is one drawback to this design.  Dumping a large pile of coins into the hopper tends to jam up at the neck of the hopper, which is inconvenient.  The hopper can be raised, which frees any such jam, however.  A small screw (which can be opened, conveniently enough, with any standard US coin!) can be removed which then allows the hopper to be swung upwards and forwards.  The sorting wheel is then directly exposed.  I have removed that screw and don't plan on putting it back, except for if the unit is moved at some point.I can't tell how long this will last, yet... and if it fails prematurely, I'll update this review.

"I purchased this very recently, knowing (a) that it was a discontinued model, and (b) that there are some issues with it.  However, I really wanted to have a real full-function joystick I could use with my newly-upgraded-to-top-of-the-line Home Theater PC.  Previously, the HTPC was sufficient for media playback, but not really for anything like games.  Now, it's my most powerful computer in my home.  And this means that games sitting on the couch is a reasonable possibility.I already own a Logitech Cordless Rumblepad, but pads are useless for flight sims and the like, in my experience.  I really wanted a joystick for the living room, and for it to be wireless.  This discontinued model remains the pinnacle of wireless-joysticks, it seems.So... THE GOOD, first.  It's very, very comfortable to use, and has a smooth mechanism.  I understand that some people have failed the sensors and buttons in their units, but I suspect that this may be related to contamination (spilling a coke on it?) or the like.  I could be wrong, and if so, I'll certainly update this review accordingly, of course.  But for now, I'm not concerned with that.  And for now, the sensors and buttons are very smooth and responsive.I've read several comments about the three ""feet"" not being rubber, but mine has a rubberized coating on those, which grips my end-table's top surface quite effectively.The buttons on this are atypical for most joysticks...  but they're not bad in any way.  I do prefer my F-16 flight stick based controls, however.  The most problematic part of this is the location of the throttle.  Having it be in the upper left ""foot"" region would have been far better, in my opinion.  But since few of the sims I'm using this with are really useful for ""single axis throttles"" anyway...  the main exception being MS Flight Sim X, where ""rapid throttle changes"" are not the norm...  this hasn't been a problem for me.  If I want to do serious flight simming, I'll do so in my office using my full HOTAS rig.  (""Hands on throttle and stick"")In general, I REALLY like this stick.  But there's a major drawback, and it's one several other people have already pointed out.  It's remarkable to me that Logitech never fixed this, because it renders the stick almost unusable as a result.This is the rapid transition into ""Power Saver"" mode, which seems to occur in less than two minutes.  And note that this is based ONLY on ""button presses,"" not on axis activity... meaning that if you're not hitting buttons, but are still steering, the stick will ""shut down"" while you're in flight.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING, unless you're playing games where shooting perpetually is always part of the gameplay.I believe I can create a work-around for this, however, using the Logitech Gaming Software.  I simply need to choose one button I'm not going to use, and set that up as a defacto ""power button.""  I'll assign that button to go into ""auto-repeat"" mode once pressed, perpetually, until the button is pressed again.  I'll make sure that whatever keypress or button press this is generating is not one which is assigned to any function in the game I'm playing.  I HOPE that doing this will prevent the ""auto-shut-down"" ""feature.""Of course, this might not be something that can be affected by the software, and actually requires REAL button presses at least once a minute to stay ""alive.""  If so, I can still work around this by assigning, say, the ""thumb button"" to do nothing, and then just keep it depressed at all times.  Annoying, but doable.I knew that this would probably be an issue going in, so I'm not really upset about it, but it's a serious design defect, and one which Logitech COULD have easily avoided.A version of this which was rechargable via USB, and which had a ""time out"" of something more like ten minutes... and, less importantly,  with the throttle moved to a better location... would be nearly the perfect wireless joystick.  It's a shame Logitech killed the product rather than simply fixing the one major, glaring defect... a SOFTWARE defect no less, not a hardware one.  A second generation version of this, with the ""bugs fixed"" would have been nice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R46VHF4F9D7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006OP9C#wasThisHelpful","R1R46VHF4F9D7R","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned this very device (from the same mold) previously, from another manufacturer.  I had two of them in my home theater PC, and when I decided to add a third drive, I needed another one (with the intent of keeping the unit both cool and quiet... and of extending system life).Note that this requires that you leave the slot underneath your disk unoccupied.  This will work nicely in almost any situation I've seen, though note, the mounting tabs can potentially interfere with the ""shelf"" tabs the drive sits on in some mounting configurations.  This is even the case in my own HTPC, and I had to mount them to the drives while already installed in the disk cages.  Still, the small tabs DO fit in between the various ""shelf tabs"" on these cages, so I can use them (unlike most other HD coolers I've seen).They run quietly and definitely reduce the measured drive temperatures, which should significantly improve overall disk lifespan.  They don't produce enough stray magnetism to impact the drive's storage, either.Note that  you require a 4-wire ""Molex-type"" drive connector... the old HD/CD type...  for power, not a ""SATA"" type connector.  The connector is a pass-through type, so you can plug this into the cable and then plug something else into this plug (even another fan)Overall, recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZ78BGC2H0TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IYJWWG#wasThisHelpful","RXZ78BGC2H0TO","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a ""monster scratchy-post"" that they can literally CLIMB, not just ""scratch"" or ""even ""stretch out on.""  The little one, younger but smaller, uses it like a gym rope... climb it, get on top, ""ring the bell"" (she really does pat a paw on top) and climb back down.  The older one has gotten on top of it... it's pretty large in diameter, and while they can't lay down up there, he was able to turn around on his four paws and face the table, which he then jumped over to.It's the best scratching post I've seen from the standpoint of ""cats love it"" so far.It's actually pretty light, and can be disassembled and reassembled easily.  And the sisal rope is going to be (relatively) easy to replace once that eventually becomes necessary.Cons?  Well, so far none, except for the obvious... it's BIG, and if you're pressed for space, it may not fit into your lifestyle.Between this and the ""shoelace prize"" that they both love to play with (which I'll string over the top sometimes) these are two happy cats.

"Jason Brandt's writing style is easy to read, and very entertaining, though by no  means ""high art prose.""  This series is an attempt to create a ""monsters of myth if they were scientifically, plausibly real"" scenario, which is almost entirely different from the prior book series he wrote which I've read, the ""West of Hell"" series (which is entirely allegorical and spiritual in nature).His writing is full of ""tells"" which are less subtle than might be found from a more talented author...  the many, many references early on to ""apparent pranksters"" who were tossing what seemed to be ""smoke bombs"" at major events was always, blatantly, obvious to me as what it was (the source of the infection).  It just smacked me in the face a bit too strongly.  And we were never told WHY these were being done, or who was behind it...  which, with the series now completed, bothers me significantly.His characters, in this book series, are a bit less subtle than I might like, as well...  in some cases played for laughs, in others, to differentiate them more effectively, it seems.  This could have been a bit less ""overstated.""But overall, I enjoyed the books.  I really liked the idea of how some people associated these things with the werewolf mythos, while others with the vampire mythos, and still others with the zombie mythos.  The reality is that these things... which were once human... have been mutated by a disease, so that they've taken on characteristics of all of these (and more, most likely, though these three were quite obvious to me).The thing is... if you want all your threads tied up all nice and neat at the end of a story (as most people do) you'll find this frustrating, as the situation simply ""IS""...  there's never a real explanation given for it, though it seems clear that the author had one in his own imagination. SOMEBODY spread the virus (?) which caused this.  Somebody had a reason for doing so.  I really want to know WHO, and WHY, and whether they didn't know what they were introducing, or whether they knew exactly what they were doing.  That's the part of this story which remains untold.  And without that, it will bug those of us who want to know the whole story.If, on the other hand, you simply like interesting characters in bad situations making the best of things...  survival horror, in other words... you'll like this quite a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUCUIQGNOEXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPK3D0G#wasThisHelpful","R1LUCUIQGNOEXH","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you own a Ruger LCP, YOU NEED at least one of these...  period.The weapon is a fine weapon, but it has no safety whatsoever...  the only safety you have is ensuring that it's unloaded, and relying on your own discipline.  Of course, it can't fire unless a round is loaded, but as a six-round-magazine weapon, that extra ""one in the pipe"" can mean the difference between life and death in a crisis situation.So...  you need this.  Every weapon should ship with one.  With it in place, you simply cannot pull the trigger (and thus the weapon cannot discharge inadvertently).  And yet, relatively easy pressure on the core of it with your trigger finger pushes the device out, making the weapon ready to fire.  It works, and it works well.  (And it doesn't interfere with your holster, by the way...  but it DOES ensure that nobody will pull the weapon from their holster with their finger ready to pull the trigger.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OX6X1BN4CPM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSVSTFK#wasThisHelpful","R1OX6X1BN4CPM5","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these for my girlfriend, who is still becoming comfortable with her ""personal protection"" and needs to be able to practice loading, unloading, clearing, etc, without the risk of making a mistake which could be dangerous.That's what these are for, and they're perfectly suited to the task.  Their weight is similar to a real round, permitting her to practice handling the weapon with it feeling ""correct""...  but without any potential for misfiring.I have a full batch for my own sidearm as well...  which I use to practice speed-loading my magazine, as well as clearing the weapon.  I've loaded and ejected them many, many times and the anodized finish remains intact..  I'm not sure how some people have managed to chip this hard, anodized surface, but I suspect that they've been beating them up pretty badly in order to do that.""Snap caps"" aren't intended for use in the field... they're for the workshop, or the backyard, really.  But these are, in my view, superior to the plastic caps I've seen others use (even if they do not have a spring, relying instead on a piece of soft material, to protect your firing pin).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QQDVGEKNWDMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVIQ6T4#wasThisHelpful","R1QQDVGEKNWDMD","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The problem with this device is that it is not shaped like an actual round (as it needs to be).  In many models of sidearms, the extractor mechanism will push this off of center (for example, the Springfield XD and XDm series).I confirmed that my laser was, in fact, straight (relative to the body of the device), before using it.  I discovered that the point emitted by this was far, far to the right of the factory-default aim point.  A test firing proved that this was incorrect, and that the factory sight location was pretty close to spot-on.Ideally, this device should have a ""rim"" around the rear edge, just as a bullet does.  This would allow the round to be held properly, as a bullet's casing is, in pretty much any weapon around.  Without that, the extractor tend to put pressure on something which (if it were a real bullet) would be up against a hard surface, but in this case, is ""in air"" and allows the boresight ""round"" to be pushed off-center (due to the necessary clearance in the barrel, some ability to ""tip"" will always be present).There may be a means to ""finesse"" this to point ahead... several people have mentioned this in their own comment here.  I have not yet found that for my own weapon, however.Better yet, the vendor ought to provide a replacement rear cap which actually reflects the physical form of a real casing.  This would NOT be difficult to do, and should be part of the design.  It's hard for me to imagine why they did otherwise, frankly...  except perhaps to save a few pennies on the cost of metal?It's a GREAT concept, and for some weapons it works beautifully...  but for those with an extraction system which applies side pressure to the round when loaded, it's not very useful.My goal is to replace the end cap with a properly shaped one... or to put a sleeve over that end cap (perhaps made from an actual casing?).  That should make this fully functional.  But Sightmark ought to be the one to do that FOR us, shouldn't they?","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AISKZG1IBSSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001C3Q9BI#wasThisHelpful","R1AISKZG1IBSSN","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a former military officer, I'm very accustomed to ""web-gear"" and nylon-rip-stop gear.  When I got a new sidearm, a Springfield XDm 40S&W (4.5"" barrel), it came with a hard-plastic ""paddle"" holster with the FBI-preferrred ""pull to the front at an angle to draw"" configuration, which I personally dislike.  I really wanted a low-hanging holster that I could strap to my thigh, like my old military-issue holster (used for my 9mm 1911 sidearm).Well, this is pretty close.  I like it, overall, but there are a few things worth pointing out.1)  There's a LOT of excess material on all the nylon straps.  This is a good idea, frankly, to provide the wides possible range of adjustment.  I've sized it to the point where I'm pretty happy now, and now I'm going to have to cut off the excess material and then ""seal"" the cut ends.  Ideally, you'd do this with a hot knife or hot scissors... but if you can't manage that, cut it to length and then run a flame over the cut end until the material at that end melts very, very slightly.  Otherwise, the web material WILL fray and unravel over time, which you don't want.2)  The neoprene pads on the leg straps works well with most materials... denim, etc... but won't work as well to ""grip"" your leg if you're wearing slick material (such as most rain gear).  While you can clamp the straps down really hard to compensate for that, they'll still ""work down"" the taper of your thigh.  Really, you need to pair this with a rough, ""grippable"" fabric, for best behavior.3)  Maybe my sidearm is just slightly too long for this... but the thumb strap is almost impossible to attach without removing my weapon belt.  I'd have preferred that the ""snap"" be on the exposed side, not underneath the weapon.  I get WHY they did this... to make it less likely to inadvertently unsnap this strap...  but if you can't reattach it when using the holster, and it instead just goes unsnapped...  well, that makes it less than useful, doesn't it?  I may need to modify my holster to fix this problem.4)  The ""overstrap"" (the large strap of nylon which goes over the rear of your sidearm, on top of the thumb strap) is a nice feature, but I think it could be improved quite a bit.5)  The ammo pouch on the front will accept a standard 16-round Springfield magazine, though it's a bit on the snug side.6)  This is NOT intended to be worn on your pants belt.  You need a load-bearing belt (I got one from Condor which has two magazine pouches provided, for a total of four on my person when I wear my belt) to support the weight, trust me on this.  Do NOT just attach it to your pants belt.Ultimately, I'm pretty happy with this, but the thumb strap issue is a real annoyance for me, and I'm going to have to modify my holster if I'm going to use this at all.I had been considering a SERPA type holster, but this is far less expensive and far more comfortable.  If the thumb stay worked as it ought to for this sidearm, I'd be totally satisfied.Oh, and key to those who think in military/tactical terms, as I do...  ""nothing rattles, nothing shines.""  Nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVDB678R9Q4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DP8MIPY#wasThisHelpful","RDVDB678R9Q4Z","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The phone case shipped is not the phone case shown in the image.  I had one of those when I first got my Razr, years ago.  I got another one a couple of years back.  It was always a perfect fit for the phone, and has cut-outs in the right places (matching the buttons and USB port).The case I received is not the same style, nor is it the same size.  It does appear to be similar construction materials, but that's about where the similarity ends.The case provided is designed for a phone of similar overall dimensions (height x width), but slightly larger.  And it is ""tapered"" so that it is very wide at the bottom and (when the flap is closed) tight at the top.  It's BIZARRE.  It's like having a pyramid shape to hold a cube.If the vendor had shipped the actual, correct phone case, I'd be a happy guy.

"I was a young man when the LucasArts game ""TIE Fighter"" came out, decades ago.  I absolutely fell in love with the game, and am a huge fan (by the way, two of the three release versions are now available through ""Good Old Games,"" but unfortunately not the best version of the three, at this point).In TIE Fighter, you were basically a pilot in the Imperial Navy.  These games expanded, quite extensively, the original Star Wars lore... and provided a semi-believable universe in the fantasy-based framework set out by Lucas's films.  The creators, led by the great Larry Holland, made what is still, to this day, treated as one of the best PC gaming experiences of all time.  The first series of games, X-Wing (and its two expansions) were great, allowing you to fly for the Rebellion in the period leading up to the Battle of Yavin (see the original Star Wars film).  TIE Fighter was better, and allowed you to fight for the Empire during a time of internal machinations, in some cases even flying alongside Darth Vader himself.  X-Wing Vs. TIE was their first foray into ""online competitive gaming"" but lacked a story (initially... an expansion pack gave it one) and ""X-Wing Alliance"" wrapped up the series, giving you the ability to fly heavy freighters (like the Millenium Falcon) as well as many different fighters, and leading you through the Battle of Endor (the final defeat of the Emperor at the second Death Star).Anyway... in TIE Fighter, there is an imperial ""arms race"" which leads to an internal rebellion of sorts, with an imperial military officer attempting to stage a coup.  During this game, you receive the ""TIE Avenger"" (aka ""TIE Advanced"") which is LOOSELY based upon Darth Vader's fighter from the first film, but is significantly different as well.  (Vader's ship was the ""TIE Advanced Prototype,"" not the production ship).  The TIE Defender was a ""secret weapon"" which came out late in that game, and was the most powerful (and expensive and rare) fighter in the entire galaxy at that point.The thing is, that ""TIE Defender"" looked very, very little like the ship provided in this pack.  The best way to think of the TIE Defender is to think of Darth Vader's TIE Fighter with three wings rather than two.  It should have an extended rear hull, behind the main hull, and large flat wings at three positions going out to solar arrays which are very similar to those on Vader's ship, essentially rectangular, except for notches front and rear.A few years back, someone ""kit-bashed"" a model of the Defender, using parts from the TIE Interceptor model kit, and started promoting that as the ""TIE Defender.""  That, not the ship as seen in the game, is what this miniature is based upon.For anyone wanting to see a fairly nice (if still not 100% accurate) comparison of the two versions... here's an image someone else made up.h t t p : / / m e d i a . m o d d b . c o m / i m a g e s / m o d s / 1 / 1 1 / 1 0 6 1 1 / T I E _ D e f e n d e r _ c o m p a r i s o n . p n gIn my own case, I've made a fairly complete model of the Defender as seen in TIE Fighter using a professional CAD software package, matching images from the game itself.Now, don't get me wrong... I really appreciate the efforts the guys making this new tabletop game are making, but I really wish that they'd go with the ORIGINAL, ACCURATE version of the TIE Defender, rather than the cheap, fast kit-bash made for a photo for the ""collectible card game"" from a pair of TIE Interceptor models several years ago.Now, as far as gameplay itself, the representation of the Defender in this game is reasonably good... albeit a small bit underpowered compared to the version in TIE Fighter.  But it's pretty close.So... if you don't care about consistency, or have no real interest in the (wonderful) original PC game, you wont' care at all... but if you do care about that, you'll find this ship miniature annoying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BK850UXV0Z78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616617721#wasThisHelpful","R2BK850UXV0Z78","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, the game itself is just great...  a few years out of date by now, but for flight sims, that's OK.  It's a lot of fun, and allows you to fly some terrific pseudo-historical missions set in the WWII era.  Visually, it's very nice, though I wish it had full head-tracker support (which is pretty much crucial for prop-era non-radar-equipped aircraft without AWACS/etc.There's a problem with this game, though...  and if you run modern hardware, you'll very likely encounter it.  The problem is a so-called ""copy protection"" scheme which is bundled with the game called ""Safedisk.""  Safedisk encrypts the actual game executable (in an ""ICD"" file) and when you run the apparent game-executable, it merely decrypts the REAL executable and runs it.In concept, not that bad of an idea.  In execution, a HORRIBLE one.  Because, for example, if you have a CD burner or the equivalent, and the Safedisk tools identify that, it will simply refuse to decrypt the file, and you will ""crash to desktop.""  It's not a problem with the program itself, it's a problem with the supposed ""copy protection"" technique.If you want to run in a compatibility mode... well, that would work just fine with the ACTUAL executable, but not in this case.  You'll be putting the ""decrypter"" into compatibility mode, not the actual game executable.  And the decrypter will fail if you put it into a compatibility mode, most of the time.  Plus, of course, you're prevented from making settings which apply to the game executable which might allow it to run properly (through setting compatibility settings).SO...  If you're willing to gamble with getting this running, I recommend it.  But if you're not technically savy, and don't have a LOT of patience... and if you expect what you buy to just work out of the box...  don't bother.  The odds are not in your favor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0ZAP7FNU8KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004WFVZ#wasThisHelpful","R1K0ZAP7FNU8KU","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the large number of really well-made simulations made under the Jane's Combat Simulations label some years ago.  While it is not the #1 best in the series, it's excellent in its own right.This is one of the first games I ever played which used ""Voxels"" (volumetric pixels...  ie, pixels which exist in three dimensions, rather than just two) to model terrain.  It does stand out a bit at low altitude, but it gives some truly remarkable visuals above a could of hundred feet of altitude.There are some technical snags in the game, for more modern operating systems, however.  The most notable one is the fact that this game uses a font type which is no longer present in Windows... and thus much of the written text in the game is thus unreadable ( including menu picks and the like).  I've tried to find a way around that, but to date, with no luck.  No one has done a patch to fix this font-engine issue, and it's doubtful that anyone ever will.  So, most of us will not be able to get the game to work properly, even if the game itself runs perfectly (since you can't see the menus).As an aside, there's also a historical disk in the set, which is worth the price of purchase alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X46URJDWH8PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000028U21#wasThisHelpful","R2X46URJDWH8PQ","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It really is ludicrous to have to pay for ""extra licenses"" to permit the use of additional cameras... but I get why this is something Foscam is doing.  They want to sell into the ""high end security"" market... which typically costs a lot more than a typical home server.  If they didn't do this, nobody would buy the high-end security stations, and everybody would just go with the traditional NAS device (which is a marvelous device).It's mildly annoying, to be sure.  But most of us will only have a handful of cameras (if we're just securing our home) and the cost of a license is pretty low compared to, say, the cost of a good-quality IP camera.  So, if you're serious about setting up surveillance for your home or office, the cost of the licenses, while annoying, is actually fairly trivial.It doesn't excuse Synology's doing this... I consider it a massively boneheaded maneuver (obviously driven by internal competition between their NAS group and their Security group).  But as bone-headed maneuvers go, it's not as bad as many others I've seen.

"Well,  I've previously owned two other (MPC-type) models of the Falcon.  The first I built ""stock,"" and the second I modified, radically, to make it more accurate.  Neither was remotely as nice as this.This is nearly the ""holy grail"" for fans of the Falcon as seen in the original Star Wars films.  (A larger version... ""studio scale"" matching the original filming miniature from TESB...  would be greatly desired by some folks, I know, but I could never have one of those... no place to put it!)It's very, very accurate.  Some people have found issues with the model, but they seem almost undetectable to me.  You can improve this even further with some aftermarket items (photoetched brass for some details, for example, or replacing plastic ""tubing"" with formed brass) and the kit isn't set up, out of the box, for lighting (but there are some truly impressive lighted builds out there already)  I plan to do that to my own version.But in general... this is about as close to perfect as you're ever going to find.  And for the cost... it OUGHT to be.FYI, folks...  ""Fine Molds,"" who make this model, have lost the license to produce Star Wars kits (which has now been awarded to Bandai, who are also quite good but tend to make ""easier to build"" kits, often with toy-like features included).  Fine Molds does very high-quality kits... I've never really seen better.

"First off, let me preface this by saying I'm not building this ""stock out of the box"" but instead intend to make significant ""upgrades"" to the model... all of which are easily supported by this kit as shipped.This is a model of the ""Hunter Killer Tank"" as seen in the flashback sequences in ""Terminator 2.""  There are some sequences in the first terminator movie showing this same era, but this is not seen clearly in those (although it's presumed to be there).  In the later Terminator films (and TV series) there are alternative versions of this... similar but not identical... as well as dramatically different designs in some cases.  But this is the one you see crushing skulls under the treads in the best of the movie series.It's actually a very well-designed machine.  If you've ever built a model kit of a tank, construction of this will be pretty familiar, except of course that most tanks are tan or grey or green, while this is supposed to be something like stainless steel.  (It's actually a fictitious metal, but it's a steel alloy, supposedly, as described in the ""Sarah Connor Chronicles"" TV series).  So, you'll need to work on doing high-quality metal finishes to make this look good.It has clear colored parts for the ""siren lights"" on the head, as well as for the ""eye"" searchlights.  The rest is all a nice, neutral grey plastic, except for the treads, which are rubber and which wrap around rotating rollers on the foot tread mechanisms.There's plenty of hardware in here to allow the thing to actually drive...  and I'm thinking about doing that (with an RC controller).  In addition to the fully-articulated treadwork, you also have pivoting joints for the head (atop the torso) and the torso (atop the base) and for the two plasma turrets which are in place of ""arms"" for this particular robot.  There are also two ""gripping arms"" at the front of the torso, but they cannot be made into functional devices without basically rebuilding them from scratch, and I'm not inclined to do that.There's a nice ""garage kit"" lighting kit already available for this (and for the air-borne variant which Pegasus also offers a model of) which, in this case, includes the ""siren lights"" in their proper flashing configuration.  With some small servomotors for the canon turrets and torso joints, and a decent gearbox and cable-drives for the motive section, I ought to be able to make this into a working scale-model (less the ability to shoot plasma, of course... or to operate without external control!)The build quality is excellent, and takes into account the desire of people like me to do the sort of thing I'm planning to do.The main ""drawback"" (if you can call it that) is that this is a pretty big model...  bear that in mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TLDTQJ83IM5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMI3GJW#wasThisHelpful","R3TLDTQJ83IM5V","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are exactly what I was looking for, as it turns out.  I needed them as replacements for some plastic parts which my movers lost during my last move (I told them to put the parts into zip-lock baggies, but they did the ""trust us"" routine and ended up costing me days setting up the bookshelves in my bedroom as a result of my having trusted them!)There's nothing ""special"" about these, but they're ideal for this sort of usage, so if you need replacement pins, I can certainly recommend these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R716N55X3VOLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TX8W6O#wasThisHelpful","R716N55X3VOLP","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the original factory part.  There are some aftermarket versions available, which are less expensive, and MAY be just as good, or perhaps even better, but I wanted the ""factory original"" replacement for my failed part.The factory original installation uses ""heat staking"" to affix this to the door panel.  This means that, basically, they press a hot iron (think of a soldering iron with a special head) onto plastic posts and melt them down into ""mushroom caps"" over the door panel interior holes which the posts pass through.The replacement part is the exact same part, so you have the option of heat-staking in place... but instead, the part ships with sheet-metal press-nuts which slip down over the posts, with ""teeth"" which prevent the press-nuts from pulling back out.  I appreciate the replacement's giving us that option, and I used the press-nuts in installation.The reason that the device needed to be replaced is that the inside portion of the handle lever (which is entirely plastic) fractures after extended use, rendering the door incapable of operation from inside the vehicle (you can roll the window down and use the outside handle just fine, of course).  The problem is a fundamental design defect, with a ""knit line"" from the injection molding process right at the maximum stress point of this (far too weak, anyway) plastic ""lever arm.""  Mine took over a decade to fracture, but many others broke a lot earlier in the vehicle's life.  It's VERY BAD MECHANICAL DESIGN, and whoever designed this part ought to be looking for a new job (it's a fundamental part of this job, which happens to be what I do for a living, too.)  Probably, this was designed by a young kid straight out of school, and never really checked by any more experienced engineer.  It LOOKS good, and it will last for a while, but it's a flawed design.So...  if you own one of the vehicles which uses this (my own is a 2003 Dodge Intrepid), and yours has failed, this is the right part for a replacement, but realize, you may still see another failure at the same point some time into the future.I'm giving this a 4-star rating because (a) it was easy to replace, (b) is EXACTLY the original factory part (with no appearance differences whatsoever) and (c) it does have the installation process improvement.  I'm knocking off the one, not based upon the part itself, but upon the vehicle design defect.  To get a 5-star rating from me, someone would have to offer an improved lever, without the design defect that the original factory design has, plus all of the above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GKSESHKBWNCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VLL0KM#wasThisHelpful","R2GKSESHKBWNCQ","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a second one of these, to replace another brand-name repeater/bridge device.  (Note - this is NOT a repeater, merely a bridge...  meaning it doesn't act as a wireless retransmitter, but DOES wirelessly connect up to four wired devices to the wireless network.)I bought a second one because my first was so utterly flawless in its performance, while the ""other name brand"" device needed to be power-cycled on, sometimes, a DAILY basis in order to remain connected.  That it's also a pretty sharp-looking device isn't really a ""selection criteria"" for me, but it certainly doesn't hurt.  It's small and unobtrusive, and retains a near-perfect link with my Asus N900 wireless router (and should do at least as well with my new AC2400 one which I have yet to actually hook up)Basically, you hook up a computer to it (through the internet cable... any of the four ports will do) and ensure that you're only connecting through the wired network, not over wireless.  This will allow you direct access to the device.  You then go through a very basic setup process, which results in the device being connected to your preferred wireless network.  You can use the ""parent network's"" security settings, or establish your own for this device, as is the case with pretty much all bridges.I have one of these in my living room, and now another one in my master bedroom.  Each is hooked up to my home entertainment equipment (BD player, Roku, TV, and for the living room, a ""Home Theater PC"").  And it provides a very, very effective, consistent, and reliable connection in both situations...  not QUITE as good as if it were a hardwired network connection, but more than adequate for streaming HD video or doing normal internet stuff.  The only place I've noticed an issue at all is with file transfers, which are (NATURALLY) far faster over a gigabit wired connection than over this, which provides about 50% of the throughput...  in theory, around 600 megabits for second, but in reality, more like 500.  Still a lot faster than any ""to the outside world"" internet connection you're likely to have (which is going to be at around 10MB, 20MB, 30MB, or 50MB, for most cable internet providers).  So, if you're connecting to the outside work, it's every bit as good as being hooked up to your main router directly, and you'll only ever notice any lower throughput if you're passing files around on a home network.This is a ""discontinued model.""  TRENDNet now has an AC-type version of this, and I've seen mixed reviews of that new device, so I stuck with the one I KNOW works well.  So, unless you have a wireless AC-type router (like the Asus AC-2400), there's absolutely no reason not to go with this, and if you DO have one, this will still be very very effective, if perhaps not QUITE as fast or with QUITE as much range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S8VLFQK0J2GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062K5JAI#wasThisHelpful","R1S8VLFQK0J2GQ","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This model is based upon a tool which has been around for many, many years, and was originally a ""glue"" kit.  MPC produced Star Wars kits during the original run of the original films, and this was one of the later kits produced.Overall, it's not a TERRIBLE kit.  In fact, the upper and lower hull sections (which make up the bulk of the kit) are really pretty accurate.  The ""inserts"" are fine, if a bit simplified from the original filming model, as well.The big issue with this kit is the ""side panels"" which go between the top and bottom halves.  These are nearly 2x as tall as they ought to be in order for this to be an accurate model of the Falcon.  (I purchased some ""garage-kit"" resin replacement sidewalls, years ago, along with some other parts, and was able to turn one of these into a really pretty accurate model of the Falcon as seen in ""The Empire Strikes Back."")  The sidewalls are also very, very poorly detailed, and not at all representative of the details found on the ""real"" Millenium Falcon.Now, realize, there were multiple models of the Falcon which were made during the run of the original films, not to mention two ""full scale"" (not really, but close enough for filming work) Falcons (the one seen in the hangar during ESB is about 2/3 scale, while the first film had a roughly 4/5 scale ""half-only"" version).  And between the first film and the second film, major revisions were made to the Falcon's design as well, most obviously with the addition of two large additional ""underside boxes"" with additional landing gear emplacements.  (The original version, which this kit is based upon, has three landing gear placements, two rear and one forward, while the revised version adds two additional ""pods"" forward, to either side.)  Each of these models, or ""full sized"" props were detailed in subtly different ways, as the models or props were built, in large part using ""found objects"" (model kit parts, or hardware salvaged from junkyards, etc).The ""Definitive"" version of the Falcon is the roughly 3.5 foot diameter primary filming miniature used in ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  It is that version with the (very expensive and very complex) ""Fine Molds"" Falcon models are based upon, while this one is based on the first-film model.Later on, when MPC was absorbed by Revell, the tooling for this kit was modified several times.  They removed the original lighting kit, then later on they added an ""interior set"" for the forward cargo-bay/lounge, and later still they converted the ""glue kit"" into a ""snap-tite"" kit.Also, the tooling was original used right here in the United States, and later was shipped off to Mexico, and then later still to China, where the product is produced today.  The attention to work paid by the workers has suffered, accordingly... so it's not shocking to me to hear that kits are being shipped with only part of the total kit in the box.  Suffice it to say the original (American-produced) version never had this issue.This is an ""adequate"" model... assuming that you receive the full kit... but is really more appropriate as a TOY than it is as an accurate model of the Falcon as seen on-screen.  And while the ""snap-tite"" approach may make for an easier build, the kit was never intended to be ""snap-tite"" and they had to shoehorn these features into a design which was intended to be glued together.  SO, I STRONGLY recommend that you go ahead and glue the kit together, if you want the kit to not just fall apart during normal handling.  (You may need to cut away some of the ""snap features"" to accomplish this, but in the long run, you'll be a lot happier with the result of this little bit of extra effort.)I had one of these sitting atop my turntable/8-track-player in my bedroom as a kid.  I later built another one up with the resin and photo-etch ""replacement parts"" which allowed me to turn the fairly accurate upper and lower hull sections into a very nice Falcon model.  But today, wanting a truly impressive and screen-accurate model (though IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER a ""toy"") I've built the 1:72 scale ""Fine Molds"" Falcon...  which puts this kit to shame by comparison.  But which is far more delicate (with many very fine details which can be damaged by excessive handling) and costs ten times more, at a minimum.If you want a ""simple"" Falcon, or want to ""play"" with it...  this is your kit.  But trust me... ignore the ""snap-tite"" element and go ahead and glue it together.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXVBP7KXAD53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013J5QQ0#wasThisHelpful","RSXVBP7KXAD53","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Star Wars proved to be a blockbuster, game-changing entertainment event, the studios scrambled to come up with other productions which could cash in on that.  One project which got a green-light as a result of Star Wars' success was something producer Glenn Larson had been trying to get made for a while, ""Mythology as science fiction"" series which became ""Battlestar Galactica.""The original premise for BSG was very, very serious, though the characters were very, very human and relate-able.  It was never intended to be a ""kid-friendly show.""  But the studio and the network chose to push it into that direction, and production cost issues also came into play (it was tremendously expensive as a television series at the time... remember, this was in the days before CGI).  Both of these factors ""undercut"" the ability to make the show which the production team originally set out to make.So, we got endlessly recycle special effects sequences...  we got ""cute kids"" and a wide range of ""kid-friendly"" bits (including a ROBOTIC DOG ""character"").  There was plenty which was mock-worthy in the original series, and that's what is most remembered about it by many today.But... if you scrape away that, you find a premise which was truly outstanding, and very, very serious.More recently, a ""re-imagining"" was done, which did ""scrape away"" the bad parts of the original series, but also ""scraped away"" the truly GOOD parts of the original as well, and replaced those with parts which were every bit as bad as the bad parts of the original, albeit in very different ways.  While it started off strong, it lost people, flailed around, became incomprehensible, and ended up with an ending that most of its biggest fans were very unhappy with.In Larson's original idea, the Cylons were not ""robots built by humans which rebelled,"" but rather an alien race which embraced its technology to such an extent that they, step by step, replaced their own bodies with machinery, and lost their ""humanity"" (so to speak) in the process.  And the colonies were the true ""mythological basis"" for our own legends.  ""Apollo"" wasn't a ""pilot's call sign,"" but rather, was the actual figure our ancient ancestors knew as a ""god"" (with that being his actual NAME).  They're HUMANS...  in their souls, much like us... but their culture is as different from our modern culture as our culture is from the ancient Egyptians.So...  now, Larson is taking part in yet another ""reboot,"" returning to the original's vision.  And part of that is retaining the original parts, which worked so well.  Including THIS SHIP (although, I'm sure, with enhanced fine details).  The folks who made the last ""reboot"" were under orders to not use the original ship design, even though they tried to honor it as much as they could.Years ago, MPC put out a model of the Galactica.  It was...  unimpressive.  Both inaccurate, and lacking in detail  The entire kit had only, as I recall, 17 parts, including two for the stand.  With a lot of effort and a lot of ""aftermarket resin detail parts"" you could turn it into something decent to look at, but the overall shapes were fairly inaccurate, and there was no way to fix that.So...  now, you have a model which is essentially the same size as that older kit, but is many, many orders of magnitude superior.  It's a GORGEOUS kit, very screen-accurate (though there are some compromises made in the production of the kit, mostly due to moldmaking limitations... and most of which can be fixed using aftermarket parts which are already available).The level of detail is many many times greater than the old ""toy like"" MPC kit.  The shapes are accurate to what was seen on-screen.  And the fit and the assembly process is nearly perfect...  there's really no need for any ""filler putty"" if you're careful as you assemble the kit.At this size (and there's quite a bit of debate as to the actual size of the original-series ship...  based upon inconsistent special effects work...  you can find some outstanding discussions of this online if you search for ""how big is the galactica?""), this is about the best you could ask for.I LOVE this model.  It's a bit too small for full lighting, but you can light key elements (landing bays, main engines, etc) easily enough.  You'd need fiber-optic strands as small as a human hair, and a drill of similar size, to get the ""windows"" right, though, so there's no point in even trying at this scale, in my view.Paul at Paragrafix has produced a great after-market photo-etched brass detail kit for this, which includes illumination-friend interior setpieces for the landing bays (as well as a few other minor details which were unable to be properly molded in the kit).http://www.amazon.com/Paragrafix-Original-Series-Galactica-Photoetch/dp/B00IWVDXAS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404783106&sr=8-1&keywords=paragrafix+galacticaWhile the original Galactica had its low points, the design work was top-notch in all areas.  If you appreciate this design, you'll LOVE this model.I HIGHLY recommend this model, and yes, the Paragrafix photoetch sheet as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPTUDQ3ZT362/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUYAQJS#wasThisHelpful","R3DPTUDQ3ZT362","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do I mean by the above, my title for this review?  Well...  I've been a HUGE Star Trek fan for many, many years, and I now the USS Enterprise backwards and forwards, inside and out.  I've created my own (extraordinarily detailed and accurate) digital model of the ship, complete with a full interior (so every set seen on the show, plus many, many other features, are present).  I don't say this to brag, but rather to point out that I've paid a lot more attention to this ship than most folks have, and I know her very, very well.Revell's model is an excellent model...  of a ship LIKE the Enterprise.  But it's not the Enterprise.  There are many, many ""errors"" in the kit, and it's hard to believe that they're accidental, given just how much information is available regarding this topic.Now, for real-world naval vessels, these ships are often built at different shipyards, and there are sometimes fairly significant differences between two real-world naval vessels which are nevertheless both of the same ""class"" of ship.  ""Class,"" you see, doesn't mean that two ships are identical...  only that they are ""operationally interchangeable"" (meaning that both can do the same job, essentially all of the time) and also interchangeable regarding support facilities (meaning that they both can be serviced by the same servicing systems).This model is, therefore, really a very nice example of a ""sister ship"" of the Enterprise, built at a different shipyard... functionally interchangeable with the Enterprise, able to be serviced and maintained at the same facilities using the same equipment... but not an identical ship.The overall proportions of the model are actually pretty good... quite accurate.  the problems are with the ""fine details,"" which includes some more significant elements as well.This is a list of just the most obvious, blatant ""errors"" on this model (if it's supposed to be the Enterprise).1)  The top-side saucer.  There's a fairly sharp dividing line between the flat outer region and the curved inner region.  On the Enterprise, this is a very smooth, consistent curve.  (You can see this in pictures associated with this Amazon page.)2)  The bottom-side saucer.  The outer rim ""flat area"" is much wider than it ought to be, and has another ""sharp transition.""  The Enterprise has a very slight ""flat area"" with a smooth, gentle curve.  The curved ""inset"" area on the underside has its tallest point much further out on the Enterprise than this model does, and the inner, downwards-pointing region is wider (and less ""steep"") throughout, with a more gentle compound curve as well.3)  The bridge (on top of the saucer) of the Enterprise is not QUITE a ""shallow"" of a dome as you see on this kit, and the clear bit atop that should be larger in diameter as well (this is, depending on your perspective, either a ""sensor dome"" or the clear ceiling of the bridge... or, perhaps, both).4)  The area surrounding the dome on the underside of the saucer should be another fairly fancy ""compound curve which actually has slight recessing.  On this model, it's a tiered, semi-conical shape, completely different from the feature on the Enterprise.  Also, the Enterprise has three ""bumps"" evenly spaced around this ring, which are absent on this model.5)  There are two triangular shapes on the underside of the saucer.  Each of these should have a raised ""rib"" on the inboard side.  This is absent on this kit.6)  The ""slope"" on the outer edge of the saucer is less on the Enterprise that the slope on the outside of this kit's saucer.7)  On the engines, there are two upwards-facing ""fins""... these are supposed to be ""intercoolers"" (a real-world term for an intermediate cooling stage in a heat-exchanger system).  This means that they are, and should be, essentially ""finned pipes.""  On the Enterprise, that's what they are.  But on this kit, they're very thin, very flat... and are essentially JUST ""fins.""8)  The ""boxy shapes"" on the engine nacelles are more prominent on this kit than they are on the ""real"" Enterprise (as portrayed on screen by the 11' filming miniature)9)  The front end of the secondary hull (""cigar shaped"" section) is completely wrong.  The kit has a region of several nearly perfectly symmetrical cylinders, but on the ""real"" Enterprise, these are much broader, and the outermost one has a significant taper to it.  Basically, it blends right into the shape of the secondary hull.  On this model, these are far narrower, with a much greater (and steeper) ""step down"" in front of the dorsal (""neck"") leading into the dish emplacement.10)  The dish ""antenna"" (which is supposed to be something like a radar dish, but is powerful enough to also push objects out of the path of the ship... it's referred to as a sensor/deflector dish) on this kit is quite a bit different from that seen on the on-screen Enterprise.And finally... and most likely to be noticed by the casual builder...11)  This model is covered by large, prominent ""grid lines"" which, in scale are several feet wide.  The ""real"" Enterprise never had anything remotely like this.  The 11"" miniature had some very, very fine PENCIL LINES drawn on it... impossible to see on the TV sets the makers of the show believed would be the only place the show would ever be seen, and used mainly to help them replace decals when they became damaged or if the production team wanted to, for example, portray another ship (or the other, unfinished, side of the 11"" model).I could go on, but that's the list of the most egregious ""errors"" in this kit.The thing is... I get the impression that these aren't really ""errors"" per-se, but rather ""artistic flourishes"" made by the team which developed this kit.  They wanted to make a kit which wasn't like every other kit on the market, it seems.  They wanted to incorporate elements which they thought made ""better sense,"" in some cases.  They blended elements of the rarer versions of the ship (also seen on screen) such as the Animated Series version, or the 3' miniature which Gene Roddenberry used to keep on his desk (and which was used along with the 11' one on the two pilot films which launched the series).  For example, the ""error"" with the front of the secondary hull is fairly ""accurate"" to the version seen in the Animated Series, though totally dissimilar to the ship seen in the original live-action series.So, I think that the ""errors"" were very likely purposeful design choices.  And as such, I can appreciate this model, and enjoy building it up... into a ""sister ship"" to the Enterprise (the USS Potempkin, for example).I still plan to fill in the gridlines... they just bug me.  And I'll replace the paper-thin ""intercoolers"" with more pipe-like parts (perhaps some after-market parts intended for the old AMT kit, which is very close to this in scale).  But the rest of the ""flaws"" in this kit can make perfect sense as another ship, built at another yard, using slightly different (but functionally interchangeable) equipment and construction.Yep...  this is, to me, the ""Revell USS Potempkin.""  As such, it's a great model.  But it's not the Enterprise... not by a long shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6BT0LO8IZOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RK7HD2#wasThisHelpful","RA6BT0LO8IZOZ","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is NOT the old AMT Kit...  it's an all-new tool, and much improved in many ways.  It is made by Revell Germany, which is a separate company from the Revell USA which makes models sold here.  Technically, Revell Germany is not permitted to sell these in the USA, so there are no ""official channels"" means of getting it here.  However, you can always buy one previously purchased by someone else...  and that's how most of these are sold.  Revell has done three all-new Trek kits (along with the Voyager which, as I understand, is the same tooling used a few years back for the USA version of that ship).  There's a ""USS Enterprise"" (which, while a fine model from a technical standpoint, has major errors... or at least ""odd design choices""... which mean that it is NOT a model of the USS Enterprise, though it could be considered one of her sister ships).  There's the ""New movie version USS Enterprise"" which is actually a pretty nice kit... though I, personally, dislike the design of the ship in the new films.And then, there's this kit.  It is NOT a replica of any Klingon ship ever seen on screen...  Rather, it is a hybrid...  a mix of elements found on multiple different versions.Ultimately, it is most closely treated as a half-way point between the ""CGI revised"" version of the Klingon ship seen in the Deep Space 9 episode ""Trials and Tribbleations,"" and the majorly altered version first seen in ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture.""Similar choices were made on the ""Enterprise"" kit... but it's a lot easier to forgive on this ship, as it can easily be treated as representing an intermediate design revision, between those two ship eras.The top surfaces of this ship have very fine panel details which were not present on the original-series ship, but were present (in only slightly more evident form) on the ""ST-TMP"" ship.  Other details are also ""half-way merges"" between those two types of ship, where elements' shapes are a blend of old and new.  The sensor tower behind the kidney-bean-shaped bridge is the most notable of the detail changes, as it has the row of observation windows which were shown so clearly in the opening sequence of ST-TMP,  but never seen on any other ship.To me, this is a great addition to the fleet, representing a Klingon ship built in between the end of the original series and the first film, showing the gradual evolution of technology.HOWEVER... if you want this to be a perfect replica of the ship seen in the original series...  you're out of luck.  The original AMT kit is far, far more accurate to that... especially after current American license holder ""Round Two"" has revised the tooling in the most recent releases.The same applies to the TOS Enterprise kit.  It's a great model...  but it's not a model of the Enterprise.  I plan to build mine as the Potempkin, and treat it as is the case with real naval vessels... ships built at different naval yards may be ""nominally the same"" but may show very visually evident differences in component shapes, specific subsystems installed, and so forth.As for the quality of the kit itself (or any other recent Revell Germany kit)... the kit is beautifully design, easy to build, and has a wide range of opportunities designed in for builder modification (such as lighting in this case).  The provided documentation is very well done (though the paint callouts refer to paint types typically only sold in Europe, not in the USA, so you'll have to do some homework to find USA equivalents).Overall.. this is probably the best of the German Trek kits.  But all are very, well-made and worth the money, in my view.  You just have to accept the ""disputable"" design choices (most significant on the TOS Enterprise, next here, and least an issue with the new movie ship).One note... if you buy this, or any other Revell Germany kit... realize that the box it's packaged in is quite flimsy.  Ensure that your seller puts this inside a larger, heavier box, with padding around it... it WILL get crushed by the post office if it's shipped with nothing but paper wrapping (as mine was).  Fortunately, the kit parts were not damaged when my own box was crushed.  But you may not be so lucky.  So, before paying, ensure that the seller will package it well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MY9E9DESJ4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RK7HDC#wasThisHelpful","R13MY9E9DESJ4A","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, this is a terrific book, but I marked it down a single point because Beck spends a large part of the latter portion of the book blaming things on a subject on which he has no real knowledge...  ""violent video games,"" mainly.The first portion of the book is chock-full of real, and confirmable, arguments which directly counter the most popular arguments made by those who are the ideological heirs to the National Socialists of the past (remember, the ""National Socialist Workers Party of Germany"" is the true name of what we often refer to as the ""Nazi party"") as they attempt, one more time, to implement policies and practices intended to create an ""elite ruling class"" which governs every aspect of the lives of the ""lesser, subjected people"" (that would be all of US, regardless of skin color, gender, or so forth, for the record!).Lots and lots of strong, factually-accurate counter-arguments.  If that was the whole book, I'd give this a full five-star rating.  (Not much in that first section which I wasn't previously aware of, mind you, but it's good to have it all compiled in one place, especially if you want to share it with others who don't already know it!)But the latter portion of the book, which shifts blame so strongly onto ""playing video games"" (something I've done, myself, since I was a kid) as a primary cause of ""violent behavior"" is just poorly reasoned.  It falls into the ""post-hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy"" realm.""Post hoc ergo propter hoc"" fallacies basically come down to this... ""we see this, and we see this, and they're together, so this one must be the result of that one.""  This is BAD LOGIC.  It's just as likely that the one treated as the ""cause"" is actually the effect, and the one treated as the ""effect"" is really the cause, or perhaps that both are the ""effect"" of some other cause which hasn't even been identified.My argument would be the exact opposite of the argument made by Beck in the latter portion of this book.  In this case, you can associate a desire to kill people with a desire to kill people online in video games.  The CAUSE is ""a brain wired to want to commit acts of violence,"" and the EFFECT is ""playing games where you get to experience doing that.""In my own case, I don't play ""online deathmatch"" games, because I find them boring... I get no pleasure from that.  But I do play ""first person"" games, including ""first person shooter"" games.  The games I most enjoy... the ones I'll actually PLAY... have actual PLOTS.  They're like movies, except that you, as the player, are the star of the film.  The games I play involve puzzles, not just ""kill zones,"" and mysteries which you have to figure out.  Your actions in these games have real consequences, in-game...  choose wrong and you suffer for it (and sometimes ""choosing wrong"" means killing, or allowing to to be killed, someone who you've just met).So...  because Beck hasn't played these games, and has no personal knowledge of them, and thus speaks from a position of ignorance on this specific subject matter, I've marked the review down a star.  He's right about the main thesis of this book...  that ""gun control"" is all about ""PEOPLE CONTROL"" (those who keep the arms, in those circumstances, have total control over those who are disarmed).  But he's incorrect in his attribution and association of ""video games"" with the perceived increase in sociopathic behavior.Realistically, isn't it a more sound argument to say that ""sociopaths today are more free to allow their inner desires out, because the potential consequences to themselves... WHICH IS THE ONLY THING WHICH CAN REIGN IN THE BEHAVIOR OF A SOCIOPATH (who have no sense of morality, and no conscience, by definition)...  have been effectively removed.""There are not ""more sociopaths"" today.  They're not being created by movies, or TV, or video games.  The numbers are the same.The problem is that today's sociopaths feel free to act on their own impulses, in a way which yesteryear's sociopaths knew they could never get away with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFO7WEJJ0WDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442365501#wasThisHelpful","R2BFO7WEJJ0WDW","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in pretty juvenile form...  I forced my way through it, but was not especially impressed.  The author doesn't really tell us a very compelling or complete story.  It has potential, but is not yet ""publishing ready.""  It's told in first-person form from a person with a very immature and self-absorbed perspective.  I mean, the entire world is collapsing, zombies are clawing at the freakin' doors, and yet every character is behaving like a spoiled child.  Not that there are many characters, mind you.The setup has potential... but we don't really get much story besides ""I like this girl and I'll go find her at all costs, even though the world is ending and she's probably already gone.""  Yes, the drama (so to speak) involves the delivery of a baby during this time, but it's not well-handled, and there's no emotional impact even when one of the main characters (as defined by ""someone who says something at some point"") dies.This author needs to take a couple of writing courses, study some really good work from other authors, and then come back and revisit this story.  Because there IS potential here, but it's not really fulfilled at any level by the story as told in this novella.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGGA4TXRZG4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Y49UK4#wasThisHelpful","R3RGGA4TXRZG4B","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item is really a curiosity these days... not something with much in the way of ""practical use.""However, I still own every computer I've ever built, with the exception of those built for friends, and have only ""given up"" one which was a deeply flawed off-the-shelf ""Packard Bell"" system, many years ago.  The old systems make up what is almost a ""museum"" for me, but I do own some software which simply cannot be run on ""modern"" systems, and so on occasion I'll hook up one of these (through a KVM - ""keyboard/video/mouse"" switch - setup) and I can use them well enough.Windows on the PB came with a full set of disks for DOS and Windows 3.11 plus the ""Workgroups Add-on.""  I still have all that, and I moved it to another machine when the Packard Bell failed so utterly.  That machine still runs today, as I said... but I've never had a full set of manuals for Windows for Workgroups 3.11, only the ""Packard Bell"" manual, and the ""Workgroups Add-on"" manual (which is a small part of this full manual).I have learned a few things which I don't think I ever knew, and at the very least have totally forgotten.  It's useful if you want to work, for any reason, on a machine still running Windows 3.11.The biggest surprise, to me, was realizing that there was a 32-bit subsystem even in this version of Windows... something I'd never known.  (Very little software at the time used 32-bit code... though Win9x, which came later, made extensive use of, and provided extensive support for, 32-bit code.)My old machine... with the Microsoft TCP stack, so I can use it on the internet, and an early copy of Netscape (which still works with the majority of websites)... and with a real 5.25"" floppy drive installed along with the more common modern bits...  still comes in handy for me, mainly for collecting data from very old sources from time to time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R383A7HQVLVQ9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038TS052#wasThisHelpful","R383A7HQVLVQ9V","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I held off on buying the main kit for a long time... despite originally having been a participant in the so-called ""1701 club,"" when I discovered that (a) the original kits were full of molding flaws and defects, and (b) the ""extras"" in the so-called ""premier"" kit weren't really things I wanted or needed, and finally (c) the team behind the kit had behaved very badly towards some of their customers, I chose to hold off.  I finally got the main kit at a significantly lower than ""original"" price (though not quite at the $75 price I still hold it SHOULD have sold for, in order to have plenty of sales!)The only ""accessory"" I really needed in this kit was the photoetch panel, but I decided it would be worth it to get the engine ""bussard collector"" (front of the engines) light board, as it was supposedly worked out to match, reasonably closely, the original series lighting effects, and I thought I'd give it a shot.  I have no real use for the ""weathering decals"" (which are very, very overstated by my own standards).  I also wanted some of the additional ""clear parts"" which I was otherwise going to have to make myself by recasting in clear resin some of the supplied polystyrene kit parts.As with the main kit, I got this at a discount, but it still costs more than the model itself, which is... PROBLEMATIC.What the add-on ""accessory parts pack"" contains...1)  A very nicely done ""add-on"" photoetched brass sheet which replaces some fine detail which is otherwise provided in ""molded"" form on the kit.  Really, this photo-etch sheet should have been provided as part of the MAIN KIT...  or rather, the individual parts (pre-trimmed from the frame and supported via lightly-adhesive backing on a sturdy card-stock sheet) should have been in that kit from the beginning, and should not be ""separate.""(There is an additional, ""third party"" photoetch detail sheet available... designed by the same guy who did this one... which is, appropriately, an ""add-on"" part, which contains some bits to help with the interior bridge and landing-bay setpieces, and gives some other nice options... and even has little figures to go behind windows and the like.  I highly recommend this add-on sheet!)2)  The ""weathering decals.""  Anyone who is planning to buy a tremendously expensive kit like this one is likely going to paint it, and likely will also be familiar with the use of pastel chalks, or light airbrushing, to create ""weathering effects.""  (I'm a chalks guy myself, as you can easily remove excess if you overdo it and haven't coated the chalk yet!)  These decals give you the infamous ""rust ring"" on the top of the saucer, but otherwise, result in a more difficult ""weathering"" process than just airbrushing or applying chalk.  (And the ""rust ring"" is really pretty easy to accomplish if you really want it on your ship anyway...especially if you're one of those who intends to keep the inaccurate ""engraved gridline pattern"" on the saucer surfaces, as you can just use the engraved lines as your guide!)3)  The lighting kit.This consists of the following:a)  two small motors with small gearboxes on them.  They're not the BEST gearmotors for this purpose... they make more noise than I'd like, frankly... but they're sufficient, and you can reduce the noise significantly by proper mounting and noise-insulation inside the nacelles (not following the kit instructions, by the way).  I suspect I'll go ahead and use these motors... but I've already worked out a mounting scheme which will allow me to replace them, easily, in the future if I need to!)b) a length of ""LED tape.""  This stuff can be obtained through many sources, and at a significantly lower cost than you're paying with this kit...  but the tape itself is good quality and it's worth it, as far as I'm concerned.  I'll be using this, though not in the way the kit specifies, and I'll be adding quite a few more short segments, as my entire ship model is going to have ""interior sets"" anywhere there's a window (with the windows being made from microscope slide slipcover glass, cut to size).c)  A wiring harness, complete with some LEDs in place already (for running lamps, etc) and with ""quick clips"" for the LED tape.  This is supposed to make for easy and quick construction...  but, as most will tell you, the clips are not very reliable.  You're far better off to remove the clips and solder directly onto the contact pads on the tape ends... unless you just can't solder, that is.  If you're not able to solder (say, if you have arthritis and you have stiff or shaky hands), the clips may come in handy, but you'll want to be VERY careful to ensure that they're ""just PERFECT"" before closing up your model!d)  A small ""wall-wart"" power supply.  In my own case, as I'm adding quite a bit to the model, I'm going to replace this with a higher-amperage (same voltage!) supply.  It'll be a 2A or 3A power supply, switching-type, but with a very high-quality ""noise reduction"" filtering element.e)  Clear molded copies of several parts which, in the kit, are molded in ""hull color.""  Mainly, this includes the part for the landing bay (not ""hangar deck""...  a hangar is where the craft are STORED, and is found one deck down from the landing bay!), the little bridge, and a few other details.  These should have been provided in the main kit, not as an ""add-on"" requiring the purchase of all this other stuff (which we really don't need).  While some of us know how to recast parts in clear resin, most don't... and those who do might prefer not having to!f)  Color-molded copies of several parts which are provided in the kit as ""plain clear"" parts.  These are mainly the lamps used within the nacelle domes, but there are others as well.  Nice to have, but these SHOULD have been provided in this form in the main kit.g)  two printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs), one for the primary ""saucer"" hull and one for the secondary ""cigar"" hull, and one PCBA each for the two warp engine nacelles.  The circuits on these are very simple, but they do include ""flasher"" circuits which come in handy, though they don't properly replicate the side-of-secondary-hull-strobes properly, and cannot be ""modified"" to reflect the different flashing patterns seen throughout the run of the original TV series.To me, the lighting kit is a ""starter kit"" which needs a LOT of work to meet my own needs.  The photoetch parts are wonderful but should have been in the main kit from the beginning.  And the decals are simply a waste of money as far as I'm concerned.That said... if you're rolling in cash, want to build a pretty good replica of the original Enterprise in large scale, don't want to, or are unable to, work very hard in making that...  buying the model and this ""accessory pack"" and a little glue can result in a model which will look ""pretty darned good"" until you get up pretty close.If you want to do a ""perfect"" version of the Enterprise, or want more configurability (and electronics reliability) you'll be treating this as a ""starting point"" but will be altering it significantly... perhaps even ""drastically"" as I'm going to be doing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLJJQMC26VHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090TOVBG#wasThisHelpful","RMLJJQMC26VHJ","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a nice, sturdy ironing board since I was in college, many years ago.  I had a silvery-silicone-coated cover on it initially, and that cover lasted for many years, but recently the elastic finally ""crumbled"" and it became useless.  So I needed a new one.The market is just full of what I consider to be tacky, ugly, and (since not coated like my old one was) not very useful ""covers.""  But I wanted one which would be equivalent to my old one.  Most of them, I think, reduced my testosterone levels just by looking at them, too!This one fits the bill perfectly.  I'm very pleased so far.The cover comes ""packed inside itself""... that is, rolled/folded up inside the ""storage pouch"" mentioned in the description.  You will NEED TO BE CAREFUL as you unpack it, because if you're not careful, you could easily shred the inner foam-rubber liner.It's also, like most older-style covers, a bit... Okay, more than ""a bit""... TIGHT, at least initially.  The fabric will stretch, over a short period of time, to conform properly to the shape of your board... or at least, it did with my board!Once on, it provides a great, heat-resistant and stain-resistant surface on which to do your ironing.Personally, I HATE ironing... but when I have to do it, I want a top-quality board (and cover) to do it on... and this one is the best I've seen since buying my original, decades ago.

"It was odd ""reviewing"" this...  as it's a replacement part for a larger system, and thus it's sort of strange, trying to not review the top-level system along with the replacement component.So...  let's do both.  The Logitech Z-5500 speaker system is a TERRIFIC 5.1 speaker system,  providing outstanding ""computer-focused"" surround sound for games and in-office-media-playback.  However, it has a few design defects and quality issues.My first control pod failed while the unit was still under warranty.  I sent it back and Logitech sent me a replacement.  The second one still functions, but the backlighting no longer works (making the display nearly unreadable in low-light conditions) and the display itself occasionally stops working entirely.The reason for this is simply that the internal electronics overheat...  sufficiently so that the surface-mount components on the board can ""migrate"" over time, if allowed to become warm.  The little LEDS are usually the first thing to ""float off"" of their surface-mount pads, while the display follows suit soon afterwards, and finally the two large integrated circuits (at which point the unit ceases to work at all).The problem is that there are only a few vents on the rear of the unit, and that surface is slanted so that there is no real way to get air circulation through the enclosure.The easiest solution (for a NEW UNIT) will be to disassemble it and drill a pattern of small holes on the upper and lower faces of the control box.  Air will then move through the unit through natural convection, and this may well be sufficient to prevent the ongoing failures so many users have experienced.A bit more complicated, you can mount a small fan inside (or, I suppose, outside?) the grill on the back... IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOLES I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED... to force air into the case (and out the holes I talk about which you'd add), or potentially to pull air out through that existing vent pattern.  I've actually ordered a fan which I plan to install in that location... 40mm x 40mm x 10mm... inside the enclosure.  It's a 12V fan but is supposed to be able to start at down to 6V, and the pod received 7.5V power from the main subwoofer, so it should be an effective (and quiet) cooling solution.The defect is that they really screwed up on their ""thermal engineering"" and the thing simply overheats... ESPECIALLY if under heavy use, but it gets ""too warm"" any time it's powered on.If I succeed in getting the new unit to work, I'll ""refit"" the old unit (resoldering the display and the surface-mount LEDs) and do the same cooling to it.It's worth noting that some people have noticed that the ""PID"" (""Product identifier,"" I presume) on the back is significant to determining compatibility.  My original one was a low number (I can't recall the exact number), the replacement Logitech sent to me was a higher number, and this unit is somewhere in between, and all work for me.  However, supposedly, the ""PID"" can result in some subwoofer/ampliers not working with some control pods.  I have no idea why, but you can find lots of information about this online, and I recommend you look into this and make your own informed choice.  Whether or not you have a good experience or a bad one may, if the internet is to be believed, depend on getting a unit in the right ""range.""Finally, all of these seem to be coming from a common location, whether you look at Amazon, Ebay, or a few other locales I've check out on the net.  I recommend using care dealing with the vendor.  While I eventually got satisfaction, initially they sent me a $5 USB dongle for a mouse instead... and when I tried to contact them via telephone, was blown off by the young asian woman who answered the phone and who refused to even let me speak to anyone else, and who eventually hang up the phone on me when I insisted that, since the ""business"" I bought from was the same address and phone number as her ""business"" address and phone number, she should at least be able to hand the phone to the person who ""worked at that business"" there.I did get things straightened out, but it was a very annoying (and more than a little insulting) way to be treated.  I informed others at the business, and I HOPE that they have altered their procedures to provide better customer-service.  So don't judge them entirely based upon my own experience, but rather just go in ""with your eyes wide open"" and protect yourself, in case they haven't corrected their internal issues.Since I have not yet received the fan I've ordered to install in this, I'm currently using an external, USB-powered fan, blowing across the back vent, which is serving to keep it more than adequately cool, by the way.  Even a small amount of air flow should do the trick.  But Logitech didn't really think that aspect of the design through.  So... if you have a failed pod, and need to replace it, this is a GREAT solution... but you'll need to address the root cause of the failure, or it'll just happen again in short order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10X77W3PSLWRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV56K6O#wasThisHelpful","R10X77W3PSLWRE","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really, really wanted to see this at the theaters, but missed it (due to some...  logistical concerns?) so I only got to see the film, for the very first time, this last weekend.  I was hopeful, but cautious...  who would know if it would be any good?I avoided the reviews, until after I'd seen it, and then read the ""rotten tomatoes"" reviews on the film.  I find myself wondering what film some of these people were watching, and whether or not the reviewers have any idea what they're talking about.  It seems that most of them refer to the 1979 movie as ""the source material"" and have no idea that the character of Superman has been around a LOT longer than that, and that the character has been played by many, many different actors, not just the late Christopher Reeve.I knew, the moment I first saw the actor in-character, though, that they'd finally gotten the casting RIGHT.  I've liked various actors at various times to various degrees, but I'd never seen any of them who looked like the character in the books, until now.  Henry Cavill is, in my personal opinion, the single best casting choice for this character yet, and I find it hard to believe that there will be a better one to follow.So...  the film starts, and we get Krypton.  Not the Krypton from the 1979 movie, but an amalgam of different Kryptons from the history of the character.  We see the ""organic, grown technology aspect,"" we get the floating drones (taken almost without alteration from the 1980s comic book reboot, by the same title as this film, ""The Man of Steel""), but we also get the ""pulp sci-fi"" elements of the older versions of Krypton as well...  including the once-ever-present ""flying beasts"" and so forth.Many, many reviewers recoiled with horror from this sequence... not because it's not faithful to the source material, and not because it's not ""good storytelling,"" but simply because it's ""not big white crystal spires with Marlon Brando in white"" just redressed.  So, let's be clear... THE KRYPTON IN THE MOVIE IS CLOSER TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL VERSION THAN THE VERSION SEEN IN THE 1979 FILM!  Got it, folks?The film, wisely, skips over the ""chronological origin story"" since we all, pretty much, know that the Kents found Kal-L, named him ""Clark,"" and raised him as their son.  We're not pounded over the head with a repeat of the full ""Clark growing up backstory"" but we are shown enough to tell the (rare) newcomer pretty much what's going on, without just rehashing old territory.We are shown General Zod...  but, unlike the (forgive the term) ""Cartoon villain"" Zod we've seen previously, we get a character who actually is not (at least in his own eyes) the ""bad guy.""  There is no doubt, in this film... Zod sees himself as the hero.. the savior of his race.What a refreshing thing to see in a film...  a ""bad guy"" who actually has a real motivation, real emotions which we, as the audience, can relate to.  Isn't it almost shocking to see a ""villain"" who becomes the villain because, in some twisted way, he's trying to ""do good?""  I LOVED this.  It was so, so much more satisfying than another ""mustachio-twirling guy"" (through granted, I still love the cartoonish villains from the 1979 film in their own way)We didn't get a full backstory for Clark... instead, we ""discover"" key moments in his past through flashbacks.  It works very well, because it's in no way ""contrived.""  We see scenes we KNOW are important, not because the producers are showing them to us, but because the CHARACTER is showing them to us...  it makes a difference in terms of the impact of each scene.There are stumbles, of course.  I found the ""death of Jonathan Kent"" to be really, really badly handled.  I get what they were trying to do...  show us that Jonathan Kent was more concerned with hiding Clark's nature than with anything else.  But...  I'm sorry, it was just SILLY.  Why not have Jonathan carry the child, and have Clark run back to get the dog?  (I mean, Clark would be faster...  and a LOT stronger...  and would have a far better chance of success.  And even if he had to use ""super power"" in some way, with the tornado behind him most people would not really notice, or would attribute it to their imagination!)I also didn't like how obvious it is, now, where Superman hails from.  Surely SOMEONE would stop to ask ""why did the Kryptonians attack Smallville, Kansas?""  Especially now that it's known that Superman ""grew up in Kansas.""  Martha, expect to see some visitors in black helicopters coming your way soon!I liked the ""wandering to find my way"" bit...  which, by the way, IS canonical, depending on which version of Superman you're talking about (Clark didn't necessarily go straight from Smallville High to the Daily Planet).  I realize some people will find this derivative of the scenes at the beginning of ""Batman Begins"" but the ""derivation"" of this far, far predates that...  read some Joseph Campbell, for his discussion of the ""hero's journey"" which always involves some period of self-exploration and even self-denial.I will admit that I was surprised to see Lois learning about Clark's identity before he worked at the Planet, but I'm OK with that.  And I liked the portrayal of Lois Lane, though I must admit, the actress playing her was... to my mind...  fairly ""generic,"" and easily replaceable.  (I actually think that the best Lois to date is Erica Durance, from the series ""Smallville."")The final conflict-stage of the film showed a LOT of violence and devastation...  and the action was non-stop.  This could have been toned down, a bit, I think...  the CGI effects went over the top...  but this was more consistent with what we see in the comic books than you might think.  (I just hope that Superman takes an active hand in the reconstruction, or it'll take many decades... after all, we've still yet to see a completed replacement for the World Trade Center!)The biggest compliant from ""serious"" Superman fans is the end of the final battle sequence...  where Superman kills.  But I find that to be a truly sad complaint, showing a lack of grasp of reality (an odd statement to make in relation to a ""comic book movie"" I suppose).  IN REAL LIFE, there are situations when there's simply no option.  You can try to ""make peace"" but sometimes, if the other guy is unwilling to make peace with YOU, you have no choice but to knock him down, and make sure he can't get back up again.  In this case, Zod was trying to continue to murder people...  personally, no less (the tens of thousands of dead from his ""technological attacks"" previously would, to his mind, be collateral damage, not ""murder"" per-se) and there was NO WAY that you could restrain him, imprison him, or otherwise make him stop... other than simply stopping him, permanently.By killing Zod, Superman saved hundreds of millions, if not six billion, human lives.  A heavy price to pay, but one that a TRUE HERO would have to pay (side note - this is an ongoing discussion in ""Batman"" circles...  is Batman actually responsible for all the deaths caused by The Joker, since had Batman simply killed the Joker early on, none of those people would have died?)The end of the film... apparently after a major reconstruction effort in Metropolis (and maybe it was the ongoing help in reconstruction which results in Superman becoming, nominally, headquartered in Metropolis rather than, say, New York or Los Angeles or Chicago)...  we find ourselves with the ""status quo"" we all expect to see...  Clark Kent as reporter at the Daily Planet, working with Lois Lane.  Any future films in this ""cycle"" will feel much more... familiar?...  to the casual fan.There is NO LEX LUTHOR in this film...  but there are signs aplenty of the presence of ""LexCorp,"" as well as several small references to ""Wayne Enterprises"" and ""Ferris Aircraft,"" among others... showing that this film takes place in a larger DC Comics universe.And it's being talked about now that the sequel to this film will likely involve some other characters...  Batman and Wonder Woman, very likely (who MAY have even been seen in this film, in a much-debated point), along with Green Lantern.  Maybe we'll even see Green Arrow or some of the other characters come along, in ""realistic"" forms.You see, DC has taken note of the success of ""The Avengers"" and the ""whole Marvel Universe"" approach...  and they're unlikely to let this go.What you see in this film is the origin story of Superman...  in a way you've never seen before.It's not a ""darker"" story...  but it's not CAMP.  It's perhaps the first fully SERIOUS take on the Superman concept (Smallville, the series, was pretty serious at times, but was a bit too ""soap opera-ish"" to really count, in my opinion... and all the other versions were light-hearted, non-serious approaches).This is a Superman who exists in a world which we can recognize, with rules we can recognize...  and people who act like real people, not like ""cartoon characters.""I, for one, have been waiting to see this for a very long time.  And this film, a few minor flaws aside, delivers what I was looking for!EDIT:  As a side note, I strongly recommend the following (I have it as an audiobook) to give you a better vision of Krypton.

"I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Max Brooks' two ""Zombie"" books... ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" and the far better companion-piece, ""World War Z.""  Brooks created an entire world, an entire ""mechanism,"" and entire natural history...... and this movie has almost nothing whatsoever to do with Brooks' books.  Let's just be up-front about that.  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND why someone would choose to ""adapt a book"" and then produce a product with only one name (and two quotes from that character) re-used (and in different context), totally change the nature of the threat, totally change the nature of the narrative... WHY?It's beyond me.  It really is.That said...  as a ""zombie movie"" this film isn't bad.  It's not GREAT, either, but it's not BAD.  The biggest problems I have with this movie are with how utterly ludicrous certain elements of it really are.Brooks created a disease... including the cause of that disease, a virus called ""Solanum"" which has been present on Earth since the beginnings of the human race, but which (until the advent of modern high-speed transportation) has always resulted in small, localized outbreaks, never in a world-wide collapse.  Key to this is that the reanimated dead are, at most, SIMPLY HUMAN.  They are not, in any way, SUPERHUMAN.  If the human body cannot do something when alive, it cannot do it when dead and reanimated, either.  And in many cases, especially as the body breaks down, these abilities become less... and NEVER become more.While Brooks' zombies never tire, exactly, they also never heal...  which means that muscle strength decreases, often dramatically, over time.They decompose slowly, because the virus (Solanum) is deadly to ALL LIVING THINGS, including bacteria and insects, and thus most living things instinctively flee from an infection, or are killed immediately if they don't flee and come into contact with it (the partial exception being humans, which are ""killed and then reanimated"" rather than merely killed.)But the zombies in this film are ""SUPER-ZOMBIES!!!!""  (Duh-duh-DAAAAAH!!!)  They can do things no human body could do, even at its prime.  They can burst through plate glass which would be physically impossible for a living human to break.  They can climb up walls which no number of living humans could climb up.  A charging group of them can ""churn"" over a bus, flipping it in the process.  They can run and leap far, far faster than any mortal human can.Heck, I'm surprised that none of them were able to FLY in this film!Further, Brooks' zombies die in a process which is pretty well-established, and which makes a certain degree of sense.  From initial contact to death is usually around 24 hours, with reanimation usually happening at some point before three more hours pass in most cases.  You can imagine Solanum reproducing within the body at that sort of rate... it requires no MAGIC to happen.  But there is no microorganism ever seen, or even IMAGINED, which can reproduce at the rate seen in this film.  From twenty-four-plus hours, we now see ""twelve seconds"" to a fully transformed zombie.So... if you hope to be able to ""willfully suspend your disbelief"" while watching this film...  and if you have the slightest grasp of biology at any level...  you'll be unable to do so, PERIOD.Further, they came up with a ""Deux Ex Machina"" solution which was made necessary by the ""SUPERZOMBIE"" nature of the reanimated in this film...  which is just ludicrous and, again, totally inconsistent with real biology at any possible level.SO...  there you go.But on the POSITIVE SIDE... you have good characterizations, a reasonable amount of fairly interesting storytelling, and some real chills and thrills along the way.Yes, it's predictable.  Yes, it's trite at times.  And yes, it relies far, far too much on CGI-created visual spectacle and not enough on solid storytelling principles.  And it's one of the most scientifically laughable movies ever made in the ""zombie"" genre (and that's saying something, isn't it!)But... if you can put those aside, it's still a movie which you'll probably enjoy, just because you really do come to care about who these people are and what happens to them (unlike most zombie flicks ever made).I do not encourage anyone to take this seriously...  but if you want some brainless, light entertainment, it's not a bad choice.On the other hand, if you're the type who enjoys deep, multi-layered storytelling (not about ""I woke up and was chased by zombies all day"" but rather ""what happens to human society when pushed beyond the breaking point?"") you should pick up Brooks' book(s).  Or even better, get the unabridged audio book version (the abridged versions are nice, too, but to get the full story, and see how it all relates, you really want the unabridged versions).The audiobooks are really remarkable, in fact, for having a full cast presentation.  Realize, the book is written from the standpoint of a journalist recording interviews with survivors of the zombie war... aka ""World War Z.""  It's done in that tone... very much like you'd hear if the news did interviews with 9/11 survivors today.  The stories are arranged to tell the story of the whole war, both in chronological terms and also in ""conceptual terms"" (with sections describing their purpose, like one entitled ""Warning Signs"" and another entitled ""Blame"").  Each story is told in ""first person"" to the interviewer...  but the characters, and the full cast of big-name actors playing them, is widely varied, and no two stories are similar, really.You can enjoy this film, for what it is... but just realize, it's unrelated to the book, and the book is FAR, FAR more worthy of your time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFJNZQYGQTCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIN0#wasThisHelpful","R2YFJNZQYGQTCY","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's start off with the following disclaimer... I am a huge original-series Star Trek fan, and have compared each subsequent series or film to that original show.  In some cases, the latter works compared favorably, and in others unfavorably, but all have the original series as the main ""yardstick"" in my mind.  This film, and its predescessor, fall into that same category... as far as I'm concerned, they exist in the shadow of the ORIGINAL, and must be compared to it.  After all, the original is still watched, today, after almost half a century.  None of what has followed on has shown anything remotely like the same ""legs"" that the original show did.The reason that the original series was, in my opinion, so wonderful was almost something ""alchemical""...  a remarkable mix of many, many element which just came together to form a fantastic whole.  While the original concepts and much of the character development came from Gene Roddenberry, he was far, far from alone in the creation of the original Star Trek.  And much of what came into being grew, not from his imagination, but from the active involvement of others unrelated to him (Gene Coon, to me, gets more credit than Gene Roddenberry does, for example, and each actor had a large role in defining their own characters).The design, done by a man with a real technical design background (in aerospace), named Walter (""Matt"") Jefferies.  The prop designs, and many of the more complex makeup designs, as well as the Romulan design...  by a master artisan named Wah Chang.  The music (not just the original fanfare by Alexander Courage, but the many other musical elements, in many cases long since forgotten by modern Trek composers, and to me sorely missed)...  the scripts written, in many cases, by accomplished prose authors...  some really great art direction and some terrific episodic directors.  It all came together to create ""magic.""The original concept was that the Captain, the First Officer, and the Chief Engineer would be the three main characters.  However, this shifted as DeForrest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy just caught fire with the audience and the production team.  Scotty was pushed back a bit, and McCoy rose to the forefront.Many view the original as so successful because it played to widely recognized psychological models...  with Kirk as the ""superego"" (the deciding factor element of the brain in psychological theory), Spock as the ""ego"" (the purely intellectual, ""higher"" element of the mind) and McCoy as the ID (the more instinctive, emotional elements of the mind).  Whether this was ever really intended...  it WORKED, and that's central to who these characters are and how they best served in the series.Star Trek, at its best, was always about us trying (and not always succeeding completely) to rise above our base natures.  It was HOPEFUL, but it was also real... these were real people, who we could imagine knowing in real life, but they were ""us as we hope we might be, at our best.""SOme of the great lines in Classic Star Trek involved Kirk's morality.  Kirk refusing to kill the helpless Gorn commander, who had been trying to kill him...  and this is what proved to the keepers of the Arena that humanity had worth.  Kirk admitting that he's ""a killer, from a race of killers... but I choose not to kill today"" in another episode.Star Trek, classically, had a MESSAGE.  A message that, as flawed as we are, we can be better, and we can overcome, and we can survive, without giving up our humanity, and without giving into our baser nature.That... not the general shape of the ships, or the color of the shirts, or the names of the characters...  is what made ""Star Trek"" special.  The latter series tried, and USUALLY succeeded, in adherence to that, but the overall quality of those latter series varied, widely.  Nevertheless, none of them ever attempted to ""revise"" the original concepts and ideals of Star Trek.Until JJ Abrams came along, that is.The first movie, in 2009, was widely enjoyed by audiences...  for being a ""thrilling romp with awesome visuals.""  It performed better than other recent Trek films, and (in unadjusted-for-inflation dollars) was the highest-grossing movie in Trek history (adjusting for inflation gives different results, of course, but ST'09 remains among the top-earning Trek films made).But that first movie lost the nature of Star Trek which I loved.  They ignored (due, I assume, to utter ignorance of real-world protocols and, more importantly, the REASONS behind those protocols) military logic.  Putting a fresh cadet in charge of the fleet flagship, ignoring the likely tens of thousands of other serving officers with far, far more experience and qualifications?  Not likely.  Uhura getting aboard the Enterprise through ""blackmail"" due to her sleeping with her superior... that's why the real military has regulations making ""fraternization"" a criminal offense (subject to prison time) for the senior personnel involved.  They failed to understand what a singularity is...  they failed to understand anything related to interstellar distances, or even intra-stellar ones (seriously, Old Spock could SEE VULCAN DESTROYED from his vantage point, but his planet was not swallowed up by the same singularity???)Still, I could almost forgive all of that... the lack of logic, of thought behind choices, of the horrendously bad set and prop design...  if the CHARACTERIZATIONS HAD BEEN RIGHT.  But...  they were not.  These were characters who had the same names, and somewhat similar appearances, but who (for the most part) felt utterly unrelated to the characters as portrayed previously.Karl Urban's McCoy was the best of the bunch, in my opinion...  and Zachary Quinto, given the script he was fed, did a decent job as Spock.  Chris Pine was, in my view, badly miscast...  a decent actor, but his ""Kirk"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Kirk I grew up with.  They created a new character, from whole cloth, and named him ""Jim Kirk,"" and expected us not to be bothered by the fact that he had nothing at all in common with the character we know.  As much of a fan as I am of Simon Pegg, I thought his ""Scotty"" was terrible...  like a bad Saturday Night Live parody.  I didn't mind John Cho as Sulu... he's a fine actor who I'm loving in ""Sleepy Hollow""...  but I found the casting of Chekov and Uhura to be pretty poor, as neither actor had anything in common with the originals except for a partial skin-tone similarity in one case... and I'd been hoping that they'd hire an actual Russian actor and an actual African actress to play the roles.Still, in that first movie, they retained to a degree the central role of McCoy in the mix, at least.  But they ignored the philosophy of Star Trek...  it was just wall-to-wall ""attitude, explosions, and pandering.""  And, of course, they seemed to be trying (way too hard, frankly) to put together ""the original series status quo"" in just a couple of hours.In the end, I really hated it, personally.  The first film left me feeling like I'd woken up in the morning, gone into my child's bedroom, and found a stranger in there, pretending to be my child...  except in mocking fashion, torturing my real child's beloved pets and so forth.  Like a mythological ""changeling""... go look it up.Still, I tried to keep an open mind with respect to this second film.  Having ""put all the pieces onto the board in the right order"" in the first film, I had hopes that they'd treat the second film as a ""classic Star Trek episode"" as much as possible, relying on the structures and philosophies with the original series so successfully implemented.Sadly,I was disappointed at every turn.At least in this film they seem to have settled on a size and scale for the Enterprise... in the first film, the size of the ship fluctuated wildly, from more than twice the length of the TNG ship (itself dwarfing the original-series ship) to just about 2x the size of the original-series ship, to one sequence showing it smaller than the original-series ship.  This time out, it seems that the ""JJ-Prise"" is something like 1.75 x the size of the original ship... but of course we get another ""hugererererer"" ship in this movie... which dwarfs the city of San Francisco (though at that size, its fall from orbit through the atmosphere at the speeds shown would have taken a seconds at most, not the minutes it showed on-screen).The characterizations were not improved in this film, with the exception of Chris Pine, who I THINK was trying (with little help from the script) to give us a Kirk who was at least somewhat reminiscent of the original.  Spock was terribly disserved... and the ""soap opera"" between lovers Spock and Uhura was really, really badly carried off.  McCoy was almost ignored...  because, apparently, JJ wants the ""big three"" to be Kirk, Spock, and Uhura.  Urban did his best, but he was given so little to do in this film that it was shocking, frankly.  Pegg's ""Scotty"" wasn't as badly ""parody-ish"" this time around... but he still doesn't seem to be portraying a character with anything at all to do with the character played by James Doohan... despite their putting in a ""Scotty drinking"" scene.  (Drinking doesn't make a character... CHARACTERIZATION does!)  Super-girl Uhura was, to me, just horrendously FORCED... JJ Abrams and team wanting to create a ""feminist-friendly starlet character"" in the film...  except that it really doesn't work.  While Zoe Saldana is a nice-looking girl and I'm sure is a decent actress... the role that this character is supposed to play in this world would not the ""action hero"" that JJ wants her to be.  He found every excuse in the book to send her along on the ""action sequences"" but all this really ended up showing is why, again, FRATERNIZATION IS A REALLY BAD THING in a military or paramilitary environment.The biggest secret re: this film, of course, was ...  KHAAAAAAAANNNN.  It was the secret which was never really a secret.  But, of course, they did their level best to make us not think it was Khan by casting an actor unrelated to either the original presentation of Khan or to the fictional-real-world nature of Khan, and having the actor playing the part show literally no common psychological or personality traits with the Khan we all know.  In other words...  why call him ""Khan"" if you're not going to make him even remotely similar to Khan as we know him?  I'd have bee happier if they'd left him with the ""assumed name"" he initially has in the film, and come up with some other reason for him to be a GOD.And that's what he was.  Khan, in the original series, was a man.  A man whose genetics had been improved through eugenics (laboratory-level selective breeding, NOT ""genetic code rewriting"" by the way!).  Stronger, faster, smarter... but still HUMAN...  just representing the pinnacle of what humanity might be...  say, the top 1% of today's strength, intellect, and so forth, all combined into a single person.But Khan in this film is MAGICAL, it seems.  His strength is akin to Clark Kent in uniform.  He's literally invulnerable to injury or damage (and has ""magic blood"" which, instead of consuming other genetically-dissimilar life, somehow can ""cure anything that ails ya!"" regardless of whether you a ""superman,"" a normal human, or a little round fuzzy lifeform from halfway across the galaxy with a totally unrelated genetic structure).  Heck, it can even bring the dead back to life!  And it'll only cost you $9.99... plus you get this set of Ginsu Knives!  (Yes, that's sarcasm... but that's exactly how I felt about this story as they showed that cheap ""McGuffin"" at the end.)Naturally, they have a massive uber-starship which dwarfs anything ever seen...  and yet can be operated by a crew of one.  (Question... if you only need one man to crew the ship... why have it be so big?  What's the point of the size of the ship in the first place?  Other than to be ""kewlerererererer and hugererererererer"" than even the JJ Enterprise, I mean?)  And this ship, with the help of this one ""superman,"" has somehow led to technological breakthroughs that the entire rest of a hundreds-of-trillions-strong population spread throughout the galaxy could never have thought of.  Again, see, it's cause ""JJ's Khan is a GOD.""  It's faster, better, stronger, tougher...  and somehow, NOBODY IN THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY-RUN UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS HAD ANY IDEA THAT THIS WAS BEING BUILT?  How, I wonder, did they fund this?  Girl scout cookie sales???  Who worked on it?  And is the JJ-verse press so totally controlled that nobody ever reported anything on any of this?  In other words...  is the JJ-Trek future really a fascist utopia?  Because, barring that, I fail to see any way that something like this makes any sense whatsoever.So...  we have this huge ship... and why?  Because ""it'll look kewl crashing into the San Francisco Bay and wiping out half the bay.""  Again, a real issue of lack of understanding of science...  such a crash would not have just ""left a groove"" and knocked down downtown San Francisco... that much energy would have wiped out EVERYTHING.  The waves alone would have wiped out every city within many miles of the SF Bay.  The impact would fracture the San Andreas Fault, and anything still standing would be down in short order.  It made NO SENSE...  but it sure did make for a kewl CGI effect, didn't it?  (Crashing something the size of the TOS Enterprise would have been much more reasonable...  but you wouldn't get those kewl sequences of a tilted saucer ""skating"" through the San Francisco skyline, would you?)Okay...  so...  characterizations - BAD.  Plausibility (remember, SCIENCE FICTION is not the same as fantasy...  it projects from what we know, it doesn't contradict what we know!) - BAD.  Design - only the most minor of improvements from the first film (at least we got minimal exposure to the Pabst Brewery this time around, and the phasers seemed to be a LITTLE bit improved... at least they didn't do ""product placement flippy shots"" to try to sell toy phasers this time!) but still, overall - BAD.This is not to say that the film isn't entertaining...  but the entertainment value is based entirely upon the ""spectacle"" of it, not based upon anything remotely akin to ""making the audience think.""  It's not impossible to do both in a film...  a movie like ""The Island"" from a couple of years back hit the ""thinking"" and the ""outrageous action"" targets equally well, for example...but this one, while a rousing success on the ""visual spectacle"" level, utterly fails on the ""makes you think, and makes you care"" level.And that second item - making you think, and making you care - is where Classic Star Trek was at its best.  Unfortunately, JJ Abrams and his team seem not to have a grasp of how to do that.Fortunately, it seems that Abrams will have minimal involvement in the next film...  at the very least, he won't be directing, anyway...  so it'll be interesting to watch and see how a new director may approach this property.  A new team, even one including elements of the team from the prior two films, could make that ""magic spark"" happen and so there's still a chance... slim, but still there... that the third film (and likely the last one with this cast and production team, I strongly suspect) might finally give us a ""Star Trek film"" which brings us the things that so many of us loved so much about the original show.  Not the costume design, not the set design or ship design, or prop design... though all of those could be much, much better... but the charcterization and writing... the direction and acting.There's hope for the future, but it's a slim hope.  This movie had ""hope"" too... and those hopes, for me at least, were totally dashed by this film.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDYKLD0C9RG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTSDDVO#wasThisHelpful","RUDYKLD0C9RG9","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little tree ornament is very accurate to the filming miniature as built by prop-master Wah Chang during the original Star Trek TV series.  (Chang also did the phasers, communicators, tricorders, and several of the most famous alien designs, including the salt vampire and the ""Balok puppet."")The only disappointing element of this is that it's a battery-powered device, and does not plug into the tree lights like the older ones did.  So, it only lights for a few seconds after pressing a button on the back, and does not stay lit.So, for design accuracy and execution - 5-stars.  For functionality as an ornament - 3-stars.

"Some years ago now, ""Polar Lights"" shut down and was acquired by ""Round 2.""  Round 2 has re-issued the prior two 1:350 Star Trek kits (the movie Enterprise and the NX-01 ""prequel"" Enterprise) but this is the first of the large kits developed entirely under the auspices of Round 2.This kit is very nicely made, overall, but there is still significant room for improvement.  In order to understand why this is the case, it's important to talk a little about the Enterprise itself.The ""real"" Enterprise, of course, never existed.  The only ""real"" ship is the one which appeared on TV sets in 1966,1967, 1968, and 1969 (three seasons) and then in re-runs for years afterwards.  There were several models used, during the run of the series, to represent the ""real"" Enterprise, and these models were not all identical.  From the tiny little ship seen in ""Catspaw"" to the 3' long model used in the pilots and on a few rare occasions afterwards, to the shop-built AMT kit used in ""the Trouble with Tribbles,"" to the 11' long model which is the best known.  Later on, we've seen several CGI versions and a new model built for the Deep Space 9 episode ""Trials and Tribblations.""The one thing that can be agreed upon is that the ship should LOOK like it looks on-screen.  But what the various details on the model were supposed to represent...  that's an often-contested, widely-disagreed-upon subject.  And the various ""versions"" of the ship... both in terms of different models, and in terms of the real physical models being revised multiple times during the series, results in a wide range of ""interpretations"" for the individual viewer of the show(s).Many years ago, the 11' model was donated by Paramount Pictures to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, where it remains today.  The model was ""restored"" at least twice, though there are only minimal records of the first restoration, so there are some contested matters related to what the model looked like before, and after, that restoration.  Later, the model was ""restored"" a second time, resulting in an overall improved and restored model, but with a paint job which almost no one approves of (with very, very strong, blatant ""panel lines"" all over the ship, and very, very heavy weathering).During the second restoration, one man, a long-time Star Trek fan himself, was given the task of recording the state of the 11' miniature Enterprise, and he did so in a great deal of detail, perhaps even more than the owners had imagined he'd go into.  That man's name is Gary Kerr, and he's parlayed this, ever since, into a ""personal claim to fame"" where he has used this opportunity to present himself as the ""main authority on the ship.""There are some good points, and some bad points, re: this.  The GOOD POINTS are that he collected a tremendous library of information on the REAL state of the model, from the original paint colors used, to the original markings, to the physical construction of the model, to very specific and pretty accurate physical measurements.  The bad points, ultimately, come down to the fact that he's drawn his own conclusions re: certain features, and has declared those personal opinions to be ""gospel,"" effectively telling anyone who views things differently that they should just shut up and accept his word for it.When Round 2 chose to make this model (long demanded by the fans), they (quite reasonably) hired Mr. Kerr to consult on the project, and he had a major hand in the design of this kit.The development process was long, drawn-out, and involved an unusual degree of interaction with the ""fan community,"" which I'd argue is a good thing... until the ""authorities"" started belittling, denigrating, and generally attacking anyone who disagreed with their position on certain FICTITIOUS design features.  It became, frankly, a matter of pride... or rather, a matter of EGO...  in some cases.Further, some basic rules of molded part design ended up being ignored, and other basic rules of economics got ignored as well, in order to make a kit which met a far, far too long list of ""wish items.""The most serious issue with this kit, frankly, is the extravagant, excessive cost.  Realistically, the model really ought to have sold (in the basic ""plastic only"" form) for about $70-75.  But the part count is far, far higher than it needed to be, and the parts are made with very, very thick plastic, in areas where this was not only unnecessary but in fact was harmful to the product.This reflect ""good intentions,"" no doubt...  the desire was to make a model which was stronger than prior versions, and it succeeds on that count.  But it also fails in a number of areas, as the thickness of the molded parts results in two issues which could easily be predicted by anyone with significant injection-molding experience.  First, a with thick plastic, the cycle time has to be VERY long, to avoid major warping of parts and of severe sink-marks (the little indentations on the outside surfaces, adjacent to the inside ""rib"" structures, caused by non-uniform cooling of the plastic material).  In fact, certain parts simply cannot avoid ""sink marks"" as this model has been built, and I have yet to see any ""warp engine nacelles"" which lack the significant sink-marks.Further, the kit was molded in multiple colors, and in the case of the ""windows and lighted features"" parts, most of them are provided in three different forms (translucent white, transparent, and smokey-dark-grey-clear).  This is a LOT of parts, and a lot of mold-switch-overs, to make the final kit.  (And if you add in the additional molded parts in even more color combinations and transparency options in the ""lighting kit"" it becomes even more significant.)So...  these two factors, alone, contributed a HUGE amount to the too-high retail price of this model kit.  Had the model shipped in ""hull grey"" alone, along with clear parts, the cost would be significantly lower.  Yes, you would not have the ""option"" to built the model without painting, in that case, as is the case with the final version which has been shipped, but I doubt very much that anyone is going to build this model without painting it, so the extra cost involved in all these various colors of plastic is, in my view, entirely wasted.And there are several parts which were made separate, for the purposes of the ""molded in color"" feature, which would have simply been part of a larger part (ie, the inner nacelle trenches), saving tooling complexity as well as part-count.  And, very likely, resulting in the absence of the ""sink marks"" present adjacent to that ""trench"" as well.The second major issue is one which reflects the ""I'm saying that these are this and that's all there is"" attitude...  the grid lines on the primary hull.  In this case, ""the authority"" declared that these marks were ""really always intended to be engraved"" and thus the kit was made that way.  (And anyone who questioned it was put down, forcefully, for arguing in favor of a model which more closely matches the ""real"" state of the 11' model...  jokes were lobbed about re: ""giant space pencils"" and the like, for example.)Now, on the 11' model, there were no engraved ""panel lines.""  There were, however, some VERY VERY FAINT pencil lines on the top and bottom of the saucer section.  These were drawn using a standard mechanical pencil, using light pressure.  Now, remember, the TV show was on the air in 1966-1969, when color TVs were a pretty new invention, and no one had dreamt of ""high definition"" nor had anyone imagined seeing the original models in HD.  And on those TV sets... the ONLY SETS that the makers of this show could have imagined that anyone would ever see the model on...  the lightly drawn pencil lines were totally invisible.  Even with Blue Ray transfers from the original film stock, and 1080p HD displays, they're almost never visible, but today, you can occasionally BARELY make them out.So... many people consider that the ""grid lines"" should not be there at all.  And still more would prefer them to be very, very fine lines on the surface of the ship, not etched into the model's skin.  (In my own case, I view these as being something like the applied antenna elements you may have on your car's windshields...  basically, conductive material applied in tape form... but ""your mileage may vary."")  And, of course, some people are really very happy about the presence of them on the kit.The problem is that more builders seem to be filling these in (a very long, painstaking, trial-and-error process) than are building with them in-place, as far as I've seen.  In my own case, I intend to fill them in, then lightly drawn lines on using a mechanical drafter's ""lead holder"" and 9H (""super-hard"") lead sharpened to a needle point, resulting in almost invisible surface lines.But there's another problem... the gridlines were eventually made fine enough that they're ""reasonably easy"" to fill in, or also ""reasonably easy"" to scribe to make more obvious...  but the models' surface finish was never fixed.  Let me explain.  When doing mold-making, a process called ""electro-discharge machining"" (EDM) is often used.  This results in a very close shape, but in a ""grainy"" surface, as the features are made by individual electrical discharges vaporizing little pits of metal from the tool.  So, as a rule, you POLISH the tool after the EDM process to get a smooth surface.In this case, there was no polishing operation performed after the EDM, so the entire saucer has a rough, ""pebble"" surface.  This means that the builder really needs to wet-sand the entire dish, with increasingly fine grade wet-or-dry sandpaper, to remove this surface and provide a smooth surface.  Again, this effectively cancels out the ""molded all in colors"" feature...  and, when combined with the need most modelers feel to fill in the (not present on the filming model except as invisible pencil lines) grid lines, and the need to fill in a lot of ""sink marks"" across the model... results in a LOT of (tedious, rather than ""fun"") time spent on fixing these issues.Finally, it's worth pointing out that the model's interior sets are not, in fact, in 1:350 scale.  The interior setpieces happen to be about 1:400, instead.  Now, this is something I personally discovered several years ago, when attempting to build a full 3D model of this ship, including interiors, in CAD software.  The interior sets simply do not match up with the exterior at the long-established size of 947' overall length.  I discovered that the sets do, in fact, work if the ship is upscaled to 1067' in overall length...  with the window positions working nicely as well when compared to on-screen deck heights.  If this were a model of a 1067' long ship, it would be 1:404, not 1:350.  Well, 1:400 is a commonly-used scale for naval vessels, and you can even get 1:400 figurines and accessories which could be used along with this model to provide additional detail, if desired.  So...  as far as I'm concerned, this is a 1:400 kit, not a 1:350 one.Overall... this is an excellent model of the classic ""TOS"" (the original series) USS Enterprise.  It's the best option yet produced, but it COULD be better still.  The main flaws are (a) excessive cost (something which can be addressed later in a second-production run, if Round 2 wants to do so, by shooting it in ""basic"" colors alone, not trying to make it ""build without painting as an option""), (b) significant issues with part warping, sink marks, etc (difficult to totally eliminate without creating entirely new tooling, unfortunately, but these can at least be minimized by careful process control during the molding procedure, and by additional material in the locations which are impossible to prevent ""sinking"" in), and (c) the grid-lines and ""coarse, pebbly"" surface texture, both of which can easily be removed by simply polishing the tool surfaces, usually part of any molded part tool design anyway.Ideally, this kit should sell for $75.  If you add in the ""weathering decals"" and the photoetch material (one item of photoetch is available through Round 2, and at least one other ""supplemental set"" is available, in this case both designed by the same talented guy, but both should really have been part of the ""kit parts as provided)...  the kit would be a reasonable sale item at $100-$110.  And the ""lighting kit"" is dramatically overpriced as well, for a production kit (it sells for a price you'd expect for a one-off ""garage kit,"" not a mass-produced kit).In the end, the sales of this model kit have been very badly impacted by the excessive sale price...  but the maker can easily recover any losses by simply revisiting their choice the first time out and selling a less expensive version (with a few less ""niceties"") later on.If you want a great model of the Enterprise, this is your best... perhaps ""only""... option right now.  If you have $400 to spend on a model kit (not counting your time, or the cost of painting, etc)...  that is, $150 for the basic kit, $175 for the lighting kit, $25 for the basic photoetch and again for the supplementary panel, another $25 or so for the ""weathering decals,"" and quite a bit just for putty and sandpaper to fill the lines...  you can turn this into a very nice replica of the original series starship Enterprise.  If you're prepared to spend a lot more time, and even more money, you may be able to turn it into a museum-level replica.  (Go check out ""Youtube"" to see some examples of some outstanding build-ups.)But...  if you're not a dedicated modeler who's prepared to spend a lot of time, energy, and money on this... I can't recommend it.  It's far, far too expensive for the ""casual builder,"" unless they've got more money than common sense.I recently obtained one at a discount, and obtained the two photoetch sets as well.  I intend to turn this into a 1:400 replica of ""my personal version"" of the ship, and I'm going to make significant modifications, both inside and outside, not the least of which will be the use of microscope slide-cover glass for the windows, with individual interior ""set pieces,"" and some custom lighting (which may end up being similar to, but will not be identical to, the options provided in the light kit, as sold by Round 2).  I've wanted to built this ship, in the way I imagine her, since I was a kid...  going on a half-century now.  This model will give me the first chance to actually do so.  And I intend to spend a lot of time, energy, and money doing so.If you're not really ""that much in love"" with this ship, you may want to hold off, or build one of the various less expensive, but less accurate, options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LC7W3GRKQBRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C5GWEW#wasThisHelpful","R1LC7W3GRKQBRL","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note, to be clear, this isn't technically a ""weapon"" in-game (and certainly not here!)...  it's a gravity field manipulator, used to pick up and move very heavy objects... in game, that is, obviously.  But, once you have it, it becomes the most effective tool in your kit and gets used more than any ""weapon"" in-game.In Half-Life 2, this device is used to solve problems... or to pick up and hurl heavy objects at attackers, or to hold items in front of you as shields.  It can be used to handle hazardous items (like plasma spheres which will kill you if they touch you) or to move planks around to cross gaps.The introduction of this device into the game made Half Life 2 so much more than just a ""shooter"" game, in other words... it meant you had to THINK, not just ""run and gun""... and that made the game far more enjoyable to me.The replica has been a long time coming, and was delayed several times.  I received mine (unexpectedly, at this point!) on Saturday, and it's Monday today, so it's still new to me.You'd expect it to come with an instruction sheet, but there is none...  so a little ""problem solving"" goes into setting it up.  I actually thought the little silver screw on the handle end was a real screw, in fact... be careful, because the silver ""screws"" are molded and don't turn! (I nearly damaged mine!)It takes three ""C""-cells (not included), and comes with a bit of duct tape (the in-game device has tape over part of the indicator dial, holding it to the body... you have to apply the tape yourself... so look at pictures from the game to get it ""just right.  And that's all that's in the box.  The device, the left-hand-side handle grip (which just inserts and rotates to lock into place) and the bit of silver duct tape.The unit has a pair of hidden ""feet"" near the front, which snap down so that the device can sit on a tabletop in an upright fashion.  I do hope that they make a STAND for it, similar to the Portal Gun stand, though, as I'm displaying both as a ""companion set"" of sorts.  The ""kickstands"" work fine, though.THe whole front end includes a lot of translucent orange plastic.  I had sort of hoped for plain (or even ""metal-appearing"") plastic, with the color provided by orange LEDs, so that the ability to put in blue LEDs (for the ""supercharged"" version from the game) would be more practical.  I do suspect that, at some point in the future, NECA will release a ""Deluxe"" version of this which can operate in ""normal"" (orange) or ""supercharged"" (blue) mode, but that's likely a long ways off, given how this one is made.There are three controls.  On the right-hand ""side cylinder"" is the on/off switch.  There's no sound when the thing powers on (of course, it's always powered-on in-game, so they'd have had to INVENT something for that, so I get why not!) but the front end lights up and it looks just like in the game.Next to the left-hand side-cylinder (and the side grip) is a button which replicates the ""gravity hold"" sound effect.  On the underside of the main grip is a trigger button which replcates the ""toss/push heavy object"" sound.  And, if you press both buttons simultaneously, you get the ""can't do it"" chirp from the game.  So, that's pretty much all the real in-game sound effects.The three ""mandibles"" are nicely articulated and reasonably sturdy (maybe moreso than the rest of the prop replica???).Overall, this ia a great replica of something really cool...  but it's BIG, and it's PRICEY, and it's not PERFECT.  And, it requires a little work on your part to make it a bit more realistic (I plan to provide further weathering on mine, especially on the orange bits, using ground pastel chalks and a fixative spray).  And, if you don't get this now, don't be shocked if alternative/improved versions come out eventually (as was the case with the portal gun... the final version was quite a bit superior, and less expensive, than the original release version!)I just really, really hope that a full stand is forthcoming sometime soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R222RQKRKQKDPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZ6KVZS#wasThisHelpful","R222RQKRKQKDPK","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started a new job recently.  The company IT policy is unusual...  while they only supply bare-bones systems, you can ""upgrade"" on your own if you like.  For example, while I got a powerhouse CAD workstation, it came without speakers (and only onboard sound).  Of course, audible feedback is crucial to so many different computer activities, it's nearly impossible to work without hearing your ""chimes"" and ""beeps"" and so forth.  So, I needed something.I came to Amazon, shopped around a bit, and found these.  I tried to check them out on Logitech's website, but found that they weren't listed there.  Well, they ARE, but not on the ""consumer"" side.  See, these are specifically part of the ""business solutions"" side... they're intended for ""office"" use.And on that basis, they're very, very effective.  The sound quality is acceptable, but by no means could it ever be described as ""high-fidelity.""  Nor is it intended to be.  And the maximum volume level is quite low, particularly compared to the big 5.1 system I have in my home office.  But it's just about perfect for an office environment.You get a very basic sound system...  which entirely bypasses the ""on-board sound"" as it's a self-contained system.  It provide good clarity (teleconferences are crystal clear, for example), but you lose the highs and lows which you might want for listening to music or watching movies... or playing games.There are two issues I have with these, and they're relatively easy to work around.  First... my desk has two monitors, but the wire between the two speakers isn't long enough to span both.  I had to cut the wire and splice in an extension.  Easy to do... the hardest part was finding wire which was suitable for the job.  But it worked out just fine for me.Second... these have the issues that every single Windows ""USB Sound"" solution which uses the default drivers will have.  (Devices with custom drivers will often, but not always, avoid this issue... for example, my Logitech keyboard at home has a sound chip built in which doesn't suffer from this issue (but I don't use it, anyway) and my G-35 headphones also are USB but have custom drivers.The issue is with the default ""Windows"" USB audio drivers, and how they handle volume.  The ""overall system volume"" control is very nearly useless... and that's what the volume buttons on the right-hand unit control.  As other reviews have stated... you have two options, really... top-volume level, or ""off.""  That's not an issue with the speakers, it's a programming error from Microsoft.This isn't a HUGE issue, however.  The ""volume control"" does provide settings for individual programs, which are in percentages of the set ""system level"" volume level, and they work just fine.  And the OS will remember where you left those settings, so it's really a ""one time"" fix for each program.For those who play games, and so forth, this would be a royal pain.  But for those who are using this in an office environment, as I am, this proves pretty much painless... so far, I've only had to adjust the volume levels for ""Windows Media Player,"" in fact... because that's the only thing I use which does much more than provide ""beeps"" and ""chimes"" and so forth for audible feedback.If you have serious needs... I do NOT recommend these.  But if you need a nice, decent, serviceable set of speakers for a WORKING environment...  a student computer for doing schoolwork, or an office computer...  these are just fine.  That, after all, is the intended target user base anyway!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Z503WOSB13N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZH98LU#wasThisHelpful","R3Z503WOSB13N","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up in both the hardcover and ""Audible"" versions, the day of its release.  Thankfully, the Audible version is an unabridged version.  Sadly, it's not narrated by Gutfeld (except for the introduction).  (Greg, please, consider doing a version fully narrated by yourself...  the guy you got did a fine job, but it's just not the same without your voice!)To those who have come here to read the various reviews before purchasing, by all means, do so.  In particular, pay attention to the various low-rated ""reviews.""  I have found myself wondering if at least one or two of those was actually posted by someone in order to promote the book, as they are, uniformly, just excellent examples of the very point Gutfeld is trying to make.A bit of history, first...  I had never heard of Gutfeld (despite having previously been a subscriber, at various points, to some of the magazines he edited, WHEN he edited them...  which just goes to show, we only notice the editor when the editor is making him/herself the story, rather than just doing their job!)  But one night, I had a bit of insomnia and decided to turn on the news.  I flipped over to Fox this time.  I assumed I'd end up watching a re-run of Hannity, or O'Reilly, or someone like that, but that wasn't the case.  Instead, I saw something that really, really surprised me...  something I'd never heard of, called ""Red Eye""... and made me laugh out loud.The first bit I saw was a ""Greg-alogue.""  And while it was funny, it was also right on target.  As I continued to watch, I discovered that some of the people on the show that night were conservative, but some were liberal... and they were GETTING ALONG, discussing the issues in a casual, non-mean-spirited way, being honest about how they felt, and you just knew that afterwards they'd all go out for drinks together with no hard feelings.It was refreshing.  It was fun.  It was REAL.  And I decided to DVR the show for a while, just to see if that was a fluke.That was five years ago, and I'm still DVRing it every night today.  I watch the show in the late afternoon... catching the prior day's show when I get home from work.  It's one of a handful of things I really, really want to see.Not long ago, there was a push to move Red Eye forward to a more reasonable time slot - midnight, rather than 3AM.  I'm completely convinced that, if this were done, the show would trounce all but the top two late-night guys, and would pose a real ""threat"" even to them.  But I think I get why this hasn't happened yet... the show, after all, isn't typical Fox fare.  (though it fits better there than it would on any other ""news"" network...  if it weren't on Fox, and if Comedy Central hadn't sold out entirely... ie, if it were still the network that Penn Gillette had so much of a role in building.. .it would belong on there, I think!)Okay, so I'm a Red Eye fan.  I also enjoy ""The Five,"" though that's not a ""must watch"" for me like Red Eye is.I ended up getting Gutfeld's book, ""The Bible of Unspeakable Truths.""  And it was terrific.  Everything I love about Red Eye, condensed and compressed into bite-sized chunks, perfect for ""mental snacking.""  And having Gutfeld read his own book really made it perfect (again, my ONE complaint about this book).I've been watching him promote his new book for some time...  and I LOVED the title (fully of both the truthfulness and sarcastic mockery of idiocy which I've come to appreciate so much).I already knew, long before the book was released, what the reaction would be from many quarters.  Like the book store employee here in Austin who managed to ""misplace"" the entire initial shipment somehow... and ended up getting canned for doing so.  Yes, the book is proudly displayed with the rest of the ""new releases"" now!And I predicted that the ""paid political posters"" would show up and post a series of attacks on the book, intended to trick ""undecided"" readers into not giving it a try.  No shock, that's what's happened.  A couple of the ""very negative"" posters here show some hint of potentially being real people, but even they are more than a little bit... suspect?One thing I've found on Amazon is that the worst books, movies, music, etc, are usually the ones which have ""only average"" reviews.  The best products are those which stir up passions... including strong passions EITHER WAY.Well, this book definitely meets that criteria, doesn't it?Gutfeld is a very smart guy.  His intelligence is more along the ""verbal intelligence"" or ""abstract idea intelligence"" line, rather than the ""math problems intelligence"" line, of course...  but he's masterful at what he does.  He can take an issue, pare it down to the reality behind it, and present it in a way which is almost impossible for anyone (at least, anyone who has any interest in being honest!) to dispute.  And he does so in a way which is humorous, rather than ""preachy.""The most important thing to realize about Gutfeld is that he's about the least ""hateful"" person you're likely to see in this field, either right or left.  Lots of ""leftists"" are going to assume that he's a ""rabid right wing"" type, and will attack him for his ""hatefulness,"" but realize, those people have no knowledge of who he is or what he says... they're only illustrating their own hate.""The Joy of Hate"" isn't promoting hate, you see.  It's promoting FREE THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION.  ""Hate"" as so often used by the left, is not intended to describe actual hate, but is simply the term they use to label any speech, thought, or expression which they, personally, well... hate.And that's the irony, which Gutfeld so aptly demonstrates throughout this book.  Those who claim to be the ""proponents of tolerance"" are in fact, the least tolerant among us.  Read some of the hostile, negative reviews, and see examples of this form of utter intolerance for any position different from their own.  They simply refuse to tolerate anything which they disagree with... they hate those who they disagree with... and they attempt to mask their own intolerance and hate by labeling those who they hate and refuse to tolerant as ""intolerant haters.""If you like to think for yourself...  if you don't mindlessly conform to their standards...  they'll hate you and refuse to tolerate you.  But you know...  as the old saying goes, you can tell who a person is by the enemies they make.  I'm proud to know that the most hateful and intolerant in our society dislike me for not being a mindless sheep, following the ""dictates"" they feed to me.  And I'm pretty sure that Greg Gutfeld feels much the same way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ADMBDX19QKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307986969#wasThisHelpful","R12ADMBDX19QKW","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own two of these devices... one for my computer at home, and another for use at work (since my current employer doesn't supply this sort of device, and makes us work with the generic, cheapo Dell mice and keyboards unless we spend our own money).Back quite a few years ago, the company behind this created a controller called the ""SpaceOrb"", aka the ""Spaceball"".  This was, essentially a pool cue ball on a stick, which you could manipulate to achieve six degrees of freedom.  (That's three axes of rotation and three directions of movement.)  Eventually, the assets behind this technology was purchased by Logitech (who had previously had their own, less successful, mainly-oriented-towards-games device) and the current ""puck"" style devices came to be.  It's very similar to the old technology, insofar as the device provides both movement (by pulling, pushing, or ""lifting/pressing"" the puck, or rotation, by tilting it or rotating it.  It's less expensive than the old version, and seems (to me) to be a bit easier to manipulate overall, though that's a matter of personal taste I suppose.There are many applications where this device can be used.  It's not just useful for pure-3D applications (it can be used to pan and zoom in graphics programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, for example).  One of the most ""fun"" applications for using this is Google Earth, where it can be used to fly over the 3D terrain, through the 3D city streets, and so forth.  It's terrific to get a feeling for locations you're going to visit in the near future.I suppose there may be some applications for this in games, though I have no idea how this might work.  The MAIN role of this is for use in 3D application.  Virtually every CAD program today has full support for this (or other similar devices - and there are a few out there from other suppliers).  You can move a CAD ""part"" or ""assembly"" just by holding the ""puck"" in your hand and applying rotational or translational pressure on the device.A significant number of 3D rendering packages also have full support for this... programs like Lightwave, Maya, 3DStudioMax, and so forth.  But realize, if the program does not support 3D controllers, or if 3DConnexion hasn't provided a ""plugin"" to provide that support, this will not be useable (or at least, it will be very difficult to get it to do what you want!).There are some programs out there...  especially some game programs which were ported from consoles to the PC...  which can become confused when this is plugged in.  So, on rare occasions, I have to unplug it (otherwise, a game character may start spinning uncontrollably!)  The ""Dead Space"" games are notoriously bad for this, for example.  It's a trivial thing to fix, but it's deeply annoying.  It's not the fault of 3DConnexion, though...Once you've gotten accustomed to using this device (or any of the other devices with the same ""core"" controller element which 3DConnexion makes, most of which have a bunch of extra buttons in addition to the ""puck""), it's hard to go back to using the mouse  and keyboard to do the same thing.The price is right... this device is hundreds of dollars less than the other ""extra buttons"" versions, and give the functionality you really need (I don't need to program ""shortcuts"" into the buttons, but I DO need the ""puck"" element!).One small issue...  on occasion, with earlier versions of the software, I would have USB detection failures.  This hasn't been an issue in four or five years for me, though.  But nevertheless, it's something to look out for.  If the device isn't properly detected... say, because you plugged it in before installing the drivers...  you might have occasional annoyances with getting it to work properly.  Fortunately, more recent driver versions do a pretty good job of cleaning out ""bad"" registry data caused by plugging it in without drivers installed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6YM0QMDTVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LB7G00#wasThisHelpful","R20I6YM0QMDTVK","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first...  this OS will not run on native 64-bit hardware, unless you can get your hands on one of the third-party ""recompiled"" kernels which can be found on hobbyist sites on occasion.  If you have early 64-bit hardware (say, the first 64-bit Athlons) you'll likely be able to make it work, or any 32-bit hardware.  Drivers for more modern hardware (video, audio, etc) are occasionally ""fan-created"" and out there, but the base OS will likely not support your hardware today.  So, your best bet for playing with this is to revive an old PC sitting in the back of a closet or in your basement or wherever.  (You can also run it in a 32-bit virtual machine, by the way, which I'm doing on my i7-based system in my office)The main draw to having this now would likely be to either revive old hardware which can't support modern OS's, or to explore REALLY GOOD OS DESIGN.  Yes, the BeOS is still the best example of what I'd consider PROPER operating system design I've ever seen.  It was designed from the ground up, in a very logical, very efficient manner.Key to the advantage of this OS is that it's the only ""pure multithreading"" support OS I've ever seen.  If you have a windows machine, and occasionally notice that one application will ""take total control"" and will freeze up other applications... this CANNOT HAPPEN on the BeOS.  The worst case, if you really overtax your system, is that everything will keep running, but will (proportionally) slow down.  Nothing will ever ""hang"" due to not being able to get to system resources.Also key is that this OS is, for all practical purposes, unlimited in terms of the number of CPU cores available to it.  Windows artificially limits the available CPU cores, while BeOS will simply farm off threads to any available core or processor, at any time, where they will run with minimal oversight from the operating system.  The OS does only what an OS SHOULD do...  it plays ""traffic cop"" for the running applications.  (Now, imagine a version of this which was recompiled to run on today's multi-core, multichip i7 type processor cores...  which would be relatively trivial for a company with the right resources... OS source code, a programming team, and Intel's core command set and timing references.)This is the best ""set"" of stuff you'll find.  BeOS r4.5 isn't the final release, but it's the last release which has hardware OpenGL support (Microsoft illegally denied, through a ""filibuster/veto"" action in their role on the OpenGL ARB at the time, BeOS's ability to implement OpenGL for v5.0/v5.1) and works just fine.  The BeOS Bible is a great book, and is really crucial (in my view) for getting the most out of the OS, and for understanding how to set it up, and how to really use it.And ""Gobe Productive"" is a terrific office ""suite.""  Gobe actually put out a Windows build of this and I use that, fairly often, even today, on my main working machine.  It's a low-overhead, fast, totally integrated application which has pretty decent (although now dated) MS Office compatibility.  The nice thing is that this is not a series of applications making up a suite, but rather a single program which can handle all varieties of document types - and can integrate elements of them into a single document, pretty much seamlessly, without needing anything like ""OLE"" to accomplish it.  You can insert a fully-functional spreadsheet into the middle of a word-processing document, just for example, not as an ""external object"" but as part of the document itself.  I LOVE that.I'm still sad that BeOS was beaten down by (illegal, in violation of antitrust laws) actions from Microsoft...  but it's a moot point now.  Be is long since gone, and their employees are scattered to the winds.But...  the FUNDAMENTAL OS DESIGN here is absolutely sound.  If someone were to use this same approach, today, but were to write native 64-bit code and provide support for native 64-bit hardware, and modern drivers for modern hardware... AND provide for OpenGL and OpenAL video and audio......  that OS would beat anything else on the market today, in terms of power, efficiency, ease of use, and programming compatibility.The main drawback would remain ""most software is compile to run in Windows, using elements of Windows,"" and those would need to be re-compiled, or a ""Windows virtual machine"" would need to be provided to allow for basic compatibility for the majority of contemporary software.  Those programs would run essentially the same in the ""virtual machine"" as they would on native hardware and Windows OS, so there's be no loss, but also no advantage.The advantage, then, would come with running software written to be ""Native"" to this supposed ""BeOS-like OS.""  That software would run circles around anything running in Windows.And, I suppose, you could have every ""windows"" application running in its own ""Virtual space"" and thus no ""windows"" application would be able to lock up and interfere with other applications... so that might be an advantage as well.Treat the BeOS as a learning tool today.  Learn the architectural approach used by the original team at Be.  Learn how they did things, and WHY they did things...  and, hopefully, take those lessons into the creation of a new OS.Windows 8 is terrible.  It really, really is.  I've tested it, and find that while the ""kernal"" level is sound, the user interface is a disaster of the like I've never seen before...  making it essentially impossible for me to use a computer the way I want to, and NEED to, for both personal and professional reasons.As a result, I fully expect another renaissance in the ""alternative operating systems"" market soon.Maybe, under another name, the BeOS's concepts may see the light of day again?

"Very soon, Microsoft is going to release ""Windows 8"" and I believe that this is going to be a disaster for Microsoft and will lead to another renaissance of ""alternative computer OS's,"" as happened back in the late '90s, when the BeOS came out.This is the last release of the BeOS.  Later ""fan-created"" alterations and add-ons came along, but as far as a released version is concerned, this is IT.Sadly, this final version is slightly hobbled by the forced removal of hardware OpenGL support, due to Microsoft's illegal activities, at the time, which resulted in Be having to withhold the OpenGL kit from the final release.  MS was on the OpenGL review board and used its veto power on the board to withhold authorization for Be to use OpenGL... one of the final nails in the coffin for Be.With Win8's horrific user interface issues, and the attempt to force all user to ""buy apps"" from Microsoft (along the lines of the apple store or Android market), conventional computer users (who prefer a PC to an iPad) will be left in the cold...  unless they go with an alternative OS.Linux comes in several flavors and is a decent alternative, but it's never become something ""accessible"" to the non-power user.  This, in other words, is exactly how things were with Linux back in the 1990s, and is still the case today.Quite a few years back, as I was becoming a bit more computer savvy, I decided to start experimenting with alternative (non-Windows) operating systems.  I tried several flavors of Linux, BSD, etc, and I also tried this...  the Be OS.The BeOS was different.  It was SIMPLE.  It was STRAIGHTFORWARD.  It was CLEAN, with a very small ""footprint"" and consumed very little system resources, but managed the system resources VERY well, allowing applications to run without any issues.Now, BeOS is ""obsolete,"" at this point, mainly because there is no significant hardware support effort (and all of that is by end-users) to allow this OS to run on modern hardware.  But, the core concepts of this OS remain very, very sound, and anyone creating a new ""alternative OS"" should take a very close look at how Be did things.Let me be very clear...  the BeOS is still (fundamentally) my favorite computer OS architecture.  The concepts behind it were perfectly sound, and the implementation was terrific.Unfortunately, Be was shot down by some illegal activities on the part of Microsoft (who never paid the price for doing what they did).  Be had managed to get their foot in the door with several of the big OEM computer manufacturers, allowing them to be shipped as an ""alternative, on request"" OS, or as a dual-boot solution.  Microsoft reacted very badly to this, and stated to the vendors that while they COULD do that, they'd ""cease receiving price considerations on Microsoft software"" if they did so.  So, Dell, HP, and the like, all bailed on their plans to offer this as an alternative.  And that, in the end, is what killed the BeOS.What's the advantage of the BeOS?  Well, it's got better multithreading handling than anything I've ever seen.  Have you ever seen one program, on your system, ""take over"" and cause every other application to stutter, stammer, and halt?  That doesn't happen... AT ALL... in the BeOS.  If you overtax the system, everything slows down, proportionally to the load, but nothing ""pauses"" at all.  And the BeOS was the first consumer OS to have, in effect, no limit on the number of processor cores (yes, there's a theoretical limit, but it's in the thousands of CPU cores).  By contrast, even today, Windows can only handle up to 16 cores, and they're not treated equally in the OS.  Most applications can only see one core, after all.The BeOS was different at an architectural level, and was so far superior over what was available at the time, and (in theory) is still superior to what is available today, that it caused Intel's VP of development to comment that ""I didn't know our hardware could do that!""Today, I still have BeOS (r5) running on an older machine.  I use it very rarely today, because there is no driver support for the BeOS for newer hardware, and the hardware from the period when BeOS was available is many orders of magnitude less powerful than today's hardware.  But it's still a great machine, and does things that even today's high-end Windows machines will ""stutter"" on slightly, even being many orders of magnitude faster overall.If you want to play around with the BeOS, and have hardware you can run it on, you should try it.

"Star Trek has had its high points and its low points over the years.  There have been some tremendous storys told, and some...  lackluster?...  ones, and some just terrible ones.Note that I grew up with the original series.  Yes, there have been additional spin-off type series, supposedly set in the same universe, and they can be treated individually, but as far as I'm concerned, ""Star Trek"" is the original TV series and the movies based upon that, not ""The Next Generation"" or ""Voyager"" or ""Deep Space Nine"" or ""Enterprise"" or the new ""reboot movie"" done by JJ Abrams a couple of years ago.  Those are all largely separate enntities, all of which (yes, including the new flick) have different characters, different situations, different storytelling techhniques, and so forth.  This doesn't NECESSARIlY make those other spin-off ideas worse, or better, just different.  You can make your own calls about the quality of each individual spin-off.  In other words, I'm just defining my terms here.That said, we can easily put the severan TNG-era movies into the comparison, as this movie far eclipses those as well.In 1979, ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"" came out.  It was the big-screen continuation of the original Star Trek TV show, supposedly ""updated.""  The quality of the visual effects was spectacular, and the new ship (it's not the same ship, it just happens to have the same name and the same general configuration) was pretty to look at.  The same actors were playing the same roles.But... the FEEL was all wrong.  It lacked the real, HUMAN, interactions which were at the core of the original series' best storytelling.  So we had a ship which felt dreary, depressing, and dehumanizing inside.  We had costuming which might have been comfortable, but was visually dull and drab.  We had dialog which occasionally ""hinted"" at the close ""just like us"" human interaction which the original series was so successful for using, but mostly, it was actors staring at pretty lights with badly-acted ""awestruck looks"" on their faces.SO...  despite being a technical masterpiece (for the most part), this first movie was not considered the sort of blockbuster which would have been required to make additional movies.Fortunately, someone at Paramount realized that it wasn't the fault of the cast, or of the overall concept, but rather of the leadership for the production, which led to the storytelling failures of this film.  And they realized that they had a lot of property, built for that first film, which would be able to be re-used at very little cost for additional films.SO...  they dumped the production team (including Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, who at this point had lost track of what he'd originally known so well when creating the original series!) and hired an entirely new production team.  A team who had no attachments to Star Trek whatsoever.They hired a well-known TV line-producer, Harve Bennett, as the executive producer (taking over from ROddenberry).  Bennett was someone who understood budgeting, scheduling, and the proper way to ""hire the right people and then get out of their way,"" all areas in which Roddenberry had failed, very badly, in while making TMP.  Bennett held sway over the majority of the remaining original-series films, with just a couple of exceptions, and much of the success of the films he led can be laid directly at his feet.They hired a really good director, who understood what the director of ""The Motion Picture"" had failed to grasp... science fiction is just set-dressing, and the storytelling must be about PEOPLE, not about ""fantastic special effects"" or ""high-concepts"" even if you're wrapped up in those things.  All the ""science fiction"" trappings of the story are there for is to open up possible HUMAN storytelling which might not be practical in ""real world"" situations.  Nicholas Meyer got that, and got it very, very well.  He, frankly, didn't care at all about the ""space"" elements of this, but he clearly understood the CHARACTERS.The budget was reduced, dramatically, from what was available in the first film.  Nevertheless, they had enough budget to create a new ship (the Reliant, a sister ship to the Enterprise) to make new uniforms (which seemed more real, and were much more visually appealing, patterned in large part upon real-world military uniforms).  They re-used quite a bit from the first movie (the two of the new sets... the space station transporter room and the Enterprise torpedo bay...  were both repaints of portions of a set... the Klingon bridge... from the first movie, for example), they raided ""stock prop"" warehouses for set-dressing (the same ""scifi set dressing"" bits seen in this film were seen in dozens and dozens of other 1970s, 1980s and 1990s TV shows), and so forth.  Heck, they made new ""communicators"" from found equipment from the local Home Depot!They did hire Lucas's special effects house, ""Industrial Light and Magic,"" to do the visual effects, and they did a fine job,  Again, to save money, they re-used some shots from the first film, so while the model of the Enterprise did get a new paint job or this film, it still has the original paint job in quite a few shots.My point is simple...  they were FRUGAL in this film.  Instead of planning out science-fictiony spectacle, as the first movie did, they focused almost entirely on the human storytelling.  The other stuff was, as it should be, all ""set dressing"" to help the audience forget that they're watching actors on a soundstage.  And it worked...  magnificently.  (A lesson which J.J. Abrams seems to have failed on, in my judgement, in his reboot movie.)The storytelling in this film is what makes it rise head and shoulders above any other Star Trek film, and over most non-Star Trek films for that matter.  We get characters who we can imagine actually knowing, and liking, in real life (something we had in the best examples of the original series as well, but lacked, entirely, in the first movie).  We got drama from situations which, while wrapped in science-fiction trappings, were really about the most fundamental human emotions...  a villain who has (understandable, if irrational) rage issues directed against the hero, and a hero who feels that his life is ""winding down"" and sees all the lost opportunities and mistakes behind him.It's a trope that ""Captain Kirk slept with every girl he met"" in the original series (it's not really true, by the way, but it's a trope nevertheless).  This movie showed the ""leading man romantic"" role he often filled in a very different light, by introducing the great love of his life, the ""little blonde lab tech"" he was mentioned as having ""almost married"" in the very first appearance of Kirk in the original series, and it turns out that he also has a son...  a son who doesn't know that Kirk is his father.  It actually explains quite a bit, and shows that there are consequences we all have to deal with for our choices.  And, thankfully, this turns out OK in the end (at least in this film!)The dialog is written so well, even with somewhat different visuals, there's no question but that these are the same characters we know and love from the original series.  It's dramatic, when appropriate, funny (in a realistic way, not a slapstick way) when appropriate, and just COMFORTABLE all the rest of the time.  No stilted ""science-fictiony"" dialog, just normal people having normal conversations about imporant things in their lives.The acting also reflects the pinnacle of the Star Trek films, and is a key element to the above.  Nick Meyer did a terrific turn as director, and as a result even some of the more lackluster actors turn in terrific performances.  I'm not a huge George Takei fan overall (""Sulu""), and I never really liked the Chekov character (though I grew to love Walter Koenig, the actor who played him, through watching Babylon 5) but this film shows both of these guys at their best.  Nichele Nichols, as Uhura, does a good job, but she's probably the most underutilized original-series actor in this film (a sad but necessary requirement of reasonable storytelling (the comms officer is seldom going to be a major player in real-life events, and in this film, the storytelling tool priority over ""giving everyone their moment""...  something later films ended up trying, way too hard at times, to do)  James Doohan's turn as Scotty in this film was also ""lightly written"" but had some really good moments.  But, as with the original series, this movie was built around the ""big three trio,"" Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.One of the things that made the original series work so well was that the big-three characters sort of grew into psychological archetypes...  Kirk as the ""superego"" (The psychology term for the part which makes decisions, based upon the input of the other two elements), the ""ego"" (the logical, rational side of our mind), through Spock, and the ID (the emotional, feelings-based side of our minds) which obviously was McCoy.  This is very clearly played out in a sequence in this film, set in Kirk's cabin, where they discuss the concept of ""Genesis"" in this film.Finally, this film did something I LOVED.  It took risks, and make ""permanent"" changes to the status-quo, in universe.  (I put ""permanent"" in quotes because, unfortunately, some of these ""permanent"" changes got reversed later...  so the brave choices made in this film largely got erased in later films, putting us back into the ""status quo,"" which was just a horrible mistake as far as I'm concerned!)The best films, but best TV shows, the best storytelling in general, must involve REAL GROWTH AND CHANGE.  This is part of why Babylon 5 remains my all-time favorite TV series...  and why, from a pure storytelling perspective, Deep Space Nine may in fact be the best drama told in the Star Trek universe.  You have to have real jeaopardy, real risk.  Characters... BELOVED characters...  need to be at real risk, and occasionally may need to die... and STAY THAT WAY.Otherwise, none of the storytelling ends up having any real impact.This film made real changes.  It introduced two three major new characters, all of whom should have become part of the ""recurring cast"" for future films (but one of whom was never seen again, one of whom was later removed entirely, and one of whom was badly recast... no offense to the replacement, but this character ceased to be the same character!)The situation at the end of the film isn't the same as we saw during the original TV series, or at the beginning of the film.  Characters have changed, new relationships are being formed...  and new character dynamics would likely be present in future films.  It was...  perfect.  It just works.  Beautifully.Later Star Trek movies were still fairly good, to varying degrees, but they lost sight of the ""story first, above all"" on occasion...  needing to give every actor their ""moment"" in each film (even if it doesn't really serve the storytelling), or drawing back from taking big risks, or (worst of all) REVERSING the ""changes"" which this film gave us, instead putting us back into the ""same thing, with no changes, but with older actors"" situation.The last ""Original series"" film was also the second best...  ""The Undiscovered Country.""  It's no shock that this film was also helmed by Nick Meyer, and while a bit lesser than this film, it's a fine film as well.  And it also deals with real change, albeit in different ways.If you only watch ONE Star Trek film, this is the one to watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MJIZI65S7AGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I3SYEI#wasThisHelpful","R3MJIZI65S7AGD","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Technically, this isn't a ""mouse pad"" at all, it's a ""mousing surface.""  It's a HARD SURFACE, not a soft one.  Traditional ""mouse pads"" are fabric-covered neoprene, but this is an entirely different thing.I've had mine for quite a while now.  I'm very, very happy with it.  I think I'd have a hard time going back to anything else, in fact.The device is symmetrical, on either side.  The differences are in the ""grain size"" of the texture on the sides.  One side has a larger grain (better for fast motion, supposedly) while the other side has a smaller grain (better for precision).  However, with a GOOD mouse... say, like any of the higher-end Logitech devices out for the past several years...  (MX mouse, performance mouse, etc)...  they are fast and accurate enough that it really makes no difference, from that standpoint, which side you use.  Both will work just fine.So, the real difference is in the ""feel"" of the surface.  The rougher surface provides greater friction, and the smoother one provides less friction.  I prefer the smoother side, personally.Now, realize that this is a plastic ""panel"" you're mousing on.  It's nice, and quite ""tough"" but it can be scratched or otherwise damaged.  If you allow junk...  granules of solid ""junk"" and so forth... to get between the mouse underside and the mousing surface, you'll eventually scratch up your mouse underside and the top side of this.  It's still up to the end-user to keep their working environment ""workable"" and that means keeping this thing CLEAN (and the underside of your mouse clean, too!) and not dumping cracker crumbs and the like all over the pad surface while using it!It's tougher to screw this up than an old fabric-on-neoprene pad would be...  but it's not impossible, and you need to be careful!The one area on this which I initially had a complaint was with the ""silkscreen"" printing on the wrist rest.  It was actually a bit uncomfortable to me, as my wrist was always rubbing over it.  Of course, that meant that it also ended up wearing, and then flaking off, and now it's completely gone. (I scrubbed it off the rest of way once I realized it was flaking away on its own!).  Putting this silk-screen material on the wrist rest pad was just DUMB.  But with it removed, the wrist rest is very comfortable.I am getting ready to move into a new office, and I think I may try to get one of these for work, as it makes my home use so much more pleasant.  I'll just have to explain why I want a supposed ""gaming accessory"" for a ""working environment"" I suppose.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262Y6FE7A67VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036WTBFY#wasThisHelpful","R262Y6FE7A67VR","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a long time, I owned a very basic ""three timer"" West Bend countertop model for my kitchen.  I can't even recall when I first bought that, but the white plastic had pretty much turned entirely yellow by the time it started malfunctioning.  After having it fail to go off (during a time I was... otherwise occupied, I guess... and ending up with my house filled with smoke from a burnt meal...  I knew it was time to replace it (not that I had much choice after venting my frustrations on the old unit... let's just say that the aged plastic shattered in a pretty explosive fashion!)I actually bought a couple of timers.  This one was my first choice, but I wanted a spare in case the various complaints I've read here turned out to be accurate for my device.Happily, I can say that this is nearly the IDEAL device from my standpoint.  And I've never had even the slightest malfuction, after more than two years worth of use.The features of this timer are far superior to any other timer I've come across, regardless of cost.Setting times is much, much easier with the use of a full keypad, rather than having to hit ""minute"" or ""hour"" or ""second"" over and over and over and over... and over... and over...I also really like the ""count UP"" feature, so I can see how long it's been since the thing went off, in real time.  Very helpful...  if a recipe says ""40-45 minutes"" you can set it for 40 minutes and you'll know, exactly, when 45 minutes is past, just for example.The sound of this is perfectly acceptable, though I actually prefer louder, more ""obtrusive"" noises... no timer out there is ""sufficient"" in that regard these days, I've found.  This is probably the best ""noticibiity"" I've  found in a timer recently, in fact.I've noticed that at least one reviewer mentions that the device is ""unstable"" on the counter... ie, that they press the buttons and the thing tips around.  I'm amazed to read that.  I mean, unless you're just POUNDING on it with your fingers, rather than simply touching the buttons (as is all which is required), I can't see how this could even be a concern.  The device is actually heavier and more stable than any other timer I've used...  and that's part of why it's my favorite as of today.The top surface is at what I consider to be an ""optimal"" viewing angle, when standing directly in front of it when it's on a kitchen counter.  This makes the device size somewhat larger than other similar devices...  it's really pretty bulky for what it does...  but I consider this an advantage, not a disadvantage.  However, if you are concerned about how much space it will take up in a drawer, for example, this might be an issue for you.Last...  the appearance of this is nicer than most other units out there.  I know, the metal and glossy-black-plastic trim isn't really a ""functional"" issue, and the appearance makes for a slightly more expensive device to produce.  Fair enough.  It's out in the open, all the time, and it matches other metal-and-black OXO items I have in my kitchen, so I like that.I recommend this, after more than two years of use, without any reservations.  It's the best I've owned, and the best I've seen while shopping, for that matter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7AC63F6P3U5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CDK0MM#wasThisHelpful","R7AC63F6P3U5M","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bough this cable to drop into my laptop bag as one of two companion items for my little Hauppauge USB tuner stick.  I have a MOHU ""LEAF +"" antenna, for over the air signals, and I have this...  and depending on the situation, I can pick up my TV over-the-air, or over the cable network.I wanted this cable, above most more ""standard"" cables, because of how thin it is.  Having a full-size cable in my bag would be impractical, at least for a cable of this length.I was concerned that the coaxial cable used in this, being as thin as it is, might be pretty poorly shielded, so ""radiated emissions"" would interfere with the signal.  So far, that's not really proven to be a problem, however, except for one time when I was in a hotel adjacent to a major ""high-tension power line"" tower run... an in that case, I was also unable to get over-the-air signals.  Suffice it to say, it's not necessarily healthy to be subjected to that level of constant electromagnetic garbage either, so I actually don't plan to stay there again.Yes, you can get better-shielded cable.  So if you're in a ""noisy"" EM environment, this cable might not be your best option.  But it's worked just fine for me, every single time so far.There's no issue with signal quality...  a thinner cable than this, in a ""clean"" environment, would be more than sufficient to get any high-definition signal.  The only issue is with ambient electromagnetic radiation (in the radio frequency bands, of course) which CAN be picked up by this cable, as the shielding isn't tremendously heavy.My advice?  Get this if you need thin cable (for portability, or for ""appearance"" if you like).  If it doesn't work for you, you'll know that you're in a ""noisy"" environment and need better shielded cable.  But few people are in ""noisy"" environments, so few people will have that sort of problem.And if you ARE in that ""noisy"" of an environment, you might want to look into WHY there's so much electromagnetic noise there... and whether you want to remain in that environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G4KNMPGZPGL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002YE35M#wasThisHelpful","R3G4KNMPGZPGL9","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off...  as several other reviewers have pointed out, (a) this is not a TOY (despite the ""ratings stars"" pretending that it is) and (b) this is an absolutely HUGE model!There are currently two different versions of this kit.  The original one, created by Polar Lights when they were a separate company, and a new, somewhat revised version which was re-released by ""Round 2"" after they purchased the Polar Lights label (so it will carry both names, not just one).  The differences aren't too extensive, but they're definitely noteable.The original release was done in blue plastic, while the re-release is in white plastic.  The original release has a ""three point support"" stand (two small holes in the aft underside of the saucer, and one slot on the underside secondary hull), while the re-release has a single-point support (using a solid steel rod) near the front underside of the secondary hull.  The ""three point"" support is actually a bit more stable, but most people prefer the single-point stand, for appearance sake.  And possibly most importantly (at least for the more casual builder), the re-release has a LOT more decals.  The original release had all the appropriate detail decals, don't get me wrong.  But when they re-released the kit, they also added in ""aztec pattern"" panel detailing decals, along with the original decals, making it relatively easy to create a very nice representation (not PERFECT, mind you, but more than adequate!) of the ship as seen on-screen, without requiring massive amounts of very detailed (and subtle) painting to achieve it.  An ""expert"" model builder will likely not use these additional decals, and will instead choose to paint the ship (exactly as seen on-screen... and realize, the model was repainted several times, so each film has a slightly different paint job, all representing the same ""real"" ship).  But that's a HUGE undertaking, and the average builder will be perfectly happy with the ""aztec decals.""This is one of the better replicas of the ""movie version"" USS Enterprise we've seen, to date, but there are some places where, between the ""design"" phase and the ""mold making phase,"" errors crept in.  Some of these are relatively easy to fix, while others are nearly impossible to fix.  None are ""really major"" (and the model is, overall, far superior to the previous AMT/Ertl version so many of us are familiar with!).  The issues are things like ""this window isn't quite in the right location"" or ""this row of panels on the neck isn't quite located right"" or ""the underside of the engine housing is slightly too flat"" or so forth.  Stuff that, to the average person, will seem like pure QUIBBLING, and only the ""scholarly studies"" of the original studio miniature would really bring to light.The model is designed to permit it to be lit, and (relatively) EASY to light.  There are lots and lots of clear bits in the kit, and there are places to run wiring throughout the model.  There is no way to run wires out of the model, however, nor is there any way to mount a switch, or are there any actual lights included.  So, if you want this kit lit, you'll have to put in quite a bit of extra effort.  For the average builder, that's just too much to ask, I suspect.The kit comes with interior ""set-pieces"" for several locations around the vessel which have larger windows, through which the interior can be seen.  In particular, there's a ""botanical garden"" (with rows of windows along either side of the secondary hull), an ""officer's lounge"" (aft of, and below, the bridge, on top of the saucer), and most notably, a complete internal ""landing bay/hangar deck/cargo deck"" facility, which reaches most of the way through the interior of the secondary hull...  the parts are really necessary to provide mechanical structure to the kit, whether they'll be seen or not... but you have the option of leaving the landing bay doors open, and of lighting this large ""set-piece"" interior, which makes for a REMARKABLE display!  And yes, there are several small shuttle and service craft included.The kit is pricey, but it's definitely worth the price you pay.  The biggest issue, for me at least, is WHERE THE HECK CAN I PUT THIS?  It's too big to put onto a standard 12"" deep shelf, and it's three feet long!  So, if you just want a simple kit to put into a small available space, this isn't the model for you!On the other hand...  especially if you're not going to light this...  it could be hung from the ceiling, using fishing line at several key spots, and would be a truly impressive display item!There are some aftermarket ""fixes and add-ons"" available...  photo-etch brass detail sets, a few ""fixed shape"" replacement parts, decals which will allow you to name your ship to whatever you want (if you don't want it to be the Enterprise), more and different shuttles, and even little figures you can put inside of the various larger windows.  These can be found through various ""garage-kit"" manufacturers, such as PNT Models, DLM (Don's Light and Magic), Paragraphix, and others.  A good place to study the kit, if you want to really go wild, and to see other build-ups, would be on the ""Starship Modeler"" website, or on the Hobbytalk website...  or just check ""youtube"" for videos, for that matter.If you want to see what this can look like...  Google is your friend.  I'd put up links to some example build-ups, but Amazon will likely remove those, so I won't bother.  But you'll find some truly impressive builds... with everything from a ""stock"" build-up, to super-detailed builds which are virtually indistinguishable from the actual filming model.If you want a challenge, which can result in a fantastic-looking final product, this is the kit for you.  If you want a ""casual build"" which can still look pretty nice, this kit is a good choice at the price it sells for now (~$60+ range).  If you just want a very simple ""toy-like"" model you can stick onto the top of a bookshelf...  this kit probably more than you're looking for.EDIT:  Someone marked this review as ""unhelpful.""  I'd love to hear what part of the review the person who did so is ""unhelpful.""  If you think I'm mistaken about something, please, point it out and we can discuss it.  Maybe you really hate this model and think I was too positive.  Maybe you really love this model and think I was too negative.  Maybe you don't care about the model at all, but just wanted to take a shot at the reviewer out of spite. There's no way to know right now.But if you felt strongly enough to criticize what I have to say, by all means, let's actually hear your criticism.

"Okay, switches aren't exactly ""cutting edge"" hardware overall, but I realized a while back that I needed one, and started to shop around.  There's no shortage of devices available, but this is the only one I found that ""really"" meets what I want.What did I want?1)  Small, with a ""normal"" shape/size (as opposed to funky, bizarrely-shaped objects which cannot actually fit, properly, alongside or in a stack with other devices I may own).2)  Sturdy, and well-shielded.  Note that the SECOND bit is more significant than the first.  There's a reason that ""professional"" electronics packages are normally housed in grounded metal housings, while ""consumer level"" hardware is usually in plastic.  Metal housings provide significant protection from both radiated EMI (electromagnetic interference)...  ie, ""outbound"" interference (which will affect other hardware) and radiated EMC (electromagnetic compatibility...  meaning resistance to ""inbound"" interference).  If in doubt, ALWAYS go with a metal housing.3)  No need for another ""wall wart"" external power supply.  In this case, the power supply is internal.  Which makes life a lot easier, AND means that if I ever misplace the power cord, I can just plug in any similar power cord... no need to do anything ""special.""4)  Ease of use and configuration.  Well, in this case, I don't even have to worry about which port is the ""upstream"" port... the device is smart enough to identify that on its own and thus I don't need flashlights and mirrors and the like to make sure I plug cables into the right ports.  VERY NICE!5)  Clear, easy-to-read indicators ON THE FRONT which tell me everything I need to know about the device (including which clients are powered on, and what data rate they're communicating at).I didn't really care all that much about the following feature, but it's sure a nice feature to have...6)  Only provides power to support actually-used ports.  Granted, the device draws little power under ANY circumstances, but even a small savings is still a savings.  I often find ""green technology"" features to be more of an annoyance than a benefit (such as wireless routers which shut down periodically... WHILE IN USE...  as part of their ""power savings"" features).  In this case, the feature is just that... a FEATURE, which in no way also becomes an inconvenience.  Nice...I actually bought this so that I could mount my wireless router in a spot where it gets the best wireless coverage for my home, and yet still have only a single network cable running from the router to the cluster where my various computers are (A total of six separate PC cabinets, running different tasks, different hardware setups, and different operating systems, at least in some cases!).If you don't have a ""cluster"" of PCs like this, but just have more than one... you'll still like having a quality ""switch"" like this, so that you can connect remotely to your router.  The ideal, frankly, is to have your wireless uplink separate from your router, but today, the trend is to have them integrated...  so if you want to place your router where it will work best for wireless purposes, a switch like this is your best option.As far as switches go...  I chose this because I determined it was the best option.  Having owned it for several months now, I agree with my original assessment.  You won't find a better switch than this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C7RVJK3K369T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033GFH2E#wasThisHelpful","R2C7RVJK3K369T","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these earphones.  I really, really do.  They're...  different... from any I've ever had before, though, and they took a bit of getting-used-to.I've had plenty of the supplied little earbuds provided with portable media players, and have never been especially impressed with the quality of sound from any of them.  So, with my (at the time) brand-new Archos 5 media player, 250GB, I wanted something I could get top-flight sound quality with.  I splurged (as it seemed at the time) on these ""expensive"" earphones, at a local store.Once I got them home, and opened up the package, I found three different silicone ""fittings"" for different sizes of ears.  (Note that there are quite a few more, available directly from Klipsch, and you may be able to find others which are also compatible.)These are unlike normal in-ear ""buds"" and actually have a small tube, with a silicone ""fitting"" over it, which seats into the ear canal.  It actually seals... and MUST seal... in order to get proper sound reproduction.  I didn't realize this at first, and was very dissatisfied with my sound quality.  I had to choose the right fitting, and then plug int deeply into my ear canal in order to get the sound quality I was expecting.Note that Klipsch sells both ""double row seal"" and ""single row seal"" silicone fittings, in multiple sizes.  You'll want to decide which works best for you, and that may or may not be one of the three size/configuration sets provided by Klipsch.  I have found that the ""medium ""size is the one which works best for my ears, so I bought a bag full of the ones I like best.  There are multiple sizes available here:  [...]  and there are other third-party replacements to be found out there as well.This set is nice and high-quality, but they provide the little ""tin"" for carrying them for a reason, folks.  Those of you who noticed that after several weeks, you lost sound in one channel...  most likely, you were coiling them up and sticking them into your pockets, right?  Well, if you did that, don't be shocked by the wires failing and losing a channel.There are a couple of things to realize - first... THESE ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR AIRPLANE USE, as far as I'm concerned.  Yes, I use them while flying... but I have to do the valsalva exercise (rolling the jaw, yawning, and exhaling to apply pressure to the ears... something I learned to do through SCUBA) in order to equalize the pressure in my ears.  The seal, key to this headset, is not really suitable for use when pressure levels are changing significantly.  So...  when flying, I use an over-the-ear set (which takes up more of my bag space, of course, but allows me to use them without having to equalize ear internal pressure!)Second...  unlike normal headsets, these are very effective at blocking out outside noise.  That's good, sometimes... unless you need to be aware of what's happening around you.  If someone tries to talk to me when I'm wearing these (even if nothing is playing), I need to reove them.  They're very effective as ""ear plugs.""And, third...  my ears are shaped in such a way that I need to reverse them.  I use the supposed ""left"" in my right ear, and ""right"" in my left ear.  They're just more comfortable that way for me.  Fortunately, this hasn't ever been an issue to me, but if I put them in ""the right way,"" the body presses against a cartilage bit on my ear at all times, which is uncomfortable.Given all that, though...  the sound quality on these is better than any other in-ear set I've ever used, and on part with all but the very best ""over ear"" phones I've used.They take some getting used to, compared to anything else I've used.  But the sound quality is truly remarkable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBEA10XR9S4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001V9LPT4#wasThisHelpful","R1YBEA10XR9S4N","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Polar Lights, now owned by ""Round 2,"" created this as their first ""very large scale"" model.  And it's VERY large.  It's not as huge as the two other 1:350 kits which have been produced so far, but only because this ship was supposed to be smaller than the other two.This is a fine reproduction of the ship as seen on-screen, and is set up to make for pretty easy lighting.  It's supported from below by multiple points, and isn't really suited for a ""single mount point"" approach.  The detail of the model is really nice.The one complaint I have has to do with some very small ""dish antenna"" around the model... which are just miniscule and are easily lost during assembly/handling.  I've now got to figure out how to replace some of these, in a more robust (and more accurate) fashion.  I'm leaning towards using metal pins (dull tipped, mind you!) and small sequins, to replace the fragile little plastic bits.Polar Lights later produced a 1:350 ""NCC-1701 Refit"" ship, as seen in ""The Motion Picture,"" ""The Wrath of Khan,"" and so forth.  It was also supported from multiple points, but is a fine model.  (Later, when Round2 purchased Polar Lights, they did a minor rework on the tooling for this, and now it's supported from a single, heavy steel shaft in the lower hull.  The new kit also has a much larger decal set provided.)And now, Round2 is about to release a 1:350 ""The original series"" USS Enterprise model... which should be just about 33"" in length... and is a ""dream"" for me, personally.If you feel the same way about the ""NX-01 Enterprise,"" this kit is the best you'll ever get.The reason it's so pricey is because (1) the kit is large to begin with, and (2) the interest level wasn't that high, so only one production run was done.  Essentially, its' a ""rare item.""  And as such, the price is what you'd expect.  When released, it cost something close to $100, as I recall.

"I have two different Archos devices... the Archos 5 Internet Media Tablet (250GB internal hard drive) and the Archos 5 Internet Tablet (NOT the same thing... bad naming conventions by Archos, mind you... this is the ""next year's version""), (500GB internal hard drive).I also have two battery docks, one for each device.

But when traveling, you need some extra power.  If you have access to a plug, on an aircraft, by all means use that.  But if you don't... and most passengers won't, I've found...  this can let you watch a lot of video, or listen to a day or more worth of music, without interruption.It's not all that complicated, really.  It's the same internal structure as the ""mini-dock,"" except that it has a single cylindrical lithium-ion cell inside, with a small ""battery management system"" (BMS) card attached to prevent overcharging.The device physically attaches through the dedicated Archos-custom hardpoint on the underside of the these two generations of units.  There are a lot of data lines and power lines in those connectors, plus a single pair which every ""add-on"" device has a resistor across, which lets the main device identify what the add-on device is.  In this case, the ""battery dock"" and the ""mini-dock"" are literally identified as the same device, as far as the Archos is concerned.  (There is also an HDMI dock, which is of essentially the same form-factor as the mini-dock but has significantly different functionality).The device comes with a ""wall-wart"" transformer/rectifier power supply.  It has a port to plug in an ""octopus"" plug which outputs analog signals (video and sound) to your TV set.  And it has a pair of USB ports (one mini-usb, intended to go to a ""host"" device, like your computer, and another full-size plug, which is intended to allow the Archos, through this, to behave as ""host"" to another device.As mentioned in some other reviews, not every device will be recognized by the Archos.  But so far, I've had great success...  keyboards, mice, external storage (all but one devices, including some hard disk enclosures, worked just fine..  though the power available is not very great, so avoid any high-power-draw devices!)I travel with the battery dock and the HDMI dock in my little Archos bag.  They both use the same power ""wall wart,"" by the way, as do all other Archos accessories except for the DVR Station, in these generations of products.  I keep the analog output cable, and a very nice super-thin HDMI cable (see here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006VFOHSY/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00), as well as a little Riitek bluetooth remote keyboard/mouse combo (see here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I4RW8C/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&smid=A2HBX5WXK67A8) and I basically have a very, very portable ""home entertainment system"" which I can use in any hotel room I find myself in.  I can charge... I can use the Archos to watch movies, listen to audio books, listen to music, listen to ""web radio"" or watch ""web TV""...  browse the internet... play games... etc, etc, all from the hotel room TV, while sitting on the bed or the couch.The biggest mistake Archos made with this generation of product was to not ship the players with, at least, the ""mini-dock"" by default, along with the transformer ""wall wart.""  If you have an Archos device compatible with this (the A5IMT, the A7IMT, the A53G (same as the A5IMT but with integrated 3G phone connection), the A5IT, or the currently-still-available A48 (same as the A5IT but without the GPS receiver), you NEED at least one ""docking station solution.""  And if you plan to use it a lot, having a secondary power source, like this provides, is a major advantage.Recommended highly for anyone who owns any of the above-mentioned devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C66XY6MY2KPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001D08A0S#wasThisHelpful","R3C66XY6MY2KPP","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do occasionally play some games, to be sure... but the feature list of this keyboard is not ""game-specific.""I wanted the following:1)  Backlighting - Check. Also, the backlighting on this keyboard can be shifted in color...  there are blue and red LEDs inside, and you can actually adjust the color from red to blue, through the entire range of ""purples"" in between.  And you can set up different color backlighting for each of three ""macro modes.""  This is NOT ""just for gaming,"" and I never use it for that purpose, but I DO use it, extensively, during video editing and for CAD work, just for example.  The backlighting can be switch on and off by a button at the top edge of the keyboard.2)  This keyboard has a built-in C-Media audio chipset...  which in theory can drive 5.1 surround sound, but is only accessible for 2.0 (ie, ""stereo"") sound on this keyboard.  It's basically the same chip that many USB headphones have in them, but allows you to connect an analog headset (or speakers and/or separate microphone) to the keyboard.  No need for the computer to have its own sound system...  so this is idea for ""work computers"" where there is no built-in sound.  While I do not need this feature, as I have a very nice sound card putting out 7.1 surround...  it's a very nice feature for the board to have.3)  The board has audio controls, which can be used to control your Windows volume level (not just the internal sound chip, but whatever your Windows sound solution is...  I have no idea if this works for Mac, Linux, etc, however), play/pause/rewind/etc for playback control and so forth.4)  The board has a mechanical switch which will disable the ""Windows Key.""  I leave this always switched off... I don't need the ""Windows key"" shortcuts, and find that it gets in the way.  I used to have to use a registry ""tweak"" to disable that... but with this keyboard, I don't have to.  NICE.5)  There's a row of twelve fully programmable ""special keys"" along the left side.  These can be programmed in three different modes, for any given program... and the functions of these can be set up to alter with whatever program has ""focus"" in Windows at the time.  It's VERY useful.  I can see how this MIGHT be useful for games, but it's useful for so many things besides games, I almost find myself annoyed that Logitech decided to market this as a ""game keyboard.""6)  The keyboard is not one of those massive, oversized things that most ""game keyboards"" are.  It's basically the size of any conventional keyboard, with just a little extra extension on the left edge (for the twelve macro keys).  It fits perfectly into any desk space, unlike those ""game keyboards"" which are typically just HUGE.It lacks the ""game features"" some other keyboards have.  It has no built in joystick or built in display, or so forth.It's just a terrific programmable keyboard.  More useful, in my opinion, for ""productive"" work than it is for ""gamers.""The only minor quibble I have is that I wish that the ""legs"" would raise it up to a slightly steeper angle... it still feels ""flat"" to me, even when it's up on the hind legs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MTQWA29EOLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RRLQIO#wasThisHelpful","R17MTQWA29EOLS","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that a series of different products are all being combined into a ""cluster"" of reviews.  AMAZON, PLEASE STOP DOING THIS!I am posting a review for the Zip-Linq Retractable Cat6 250Mhz Gigabit network cable, RJN5, 5' length.  Some of the reviews here are clearly for other products, unrelated to this, which is ""odd"" at best.This is a fine cable.  As with all retractable cables, you need to treat it with a fair amount of care.  ""Yanking"" randomly on it will cause premature failure, and the mechanism is delicate enough to be crushed if handled improperly.  It's not ""fragile,"" exactly...  it's really quite robust for what it is.  But I know some people rate things badly after abusing them and having the device fail under abuse.  So, treat it as what it is... a piece of technology... and it should be just fine.It's a pretty long cable, and it's really a true gigabit-capable cable.  It's not a ""Cat 5"" or ""Cat 5e"" cable, as some reviews here seem to mention.  As a result, it's actually a pretty large spool, just under an inch in total thickness, and about 2"" in diameter or so (I haven't measured it, mind you, I'm just estimating here).  The point is...  it's similar in diameter to my previous ""retractable network cable"" (Cat 5) but is over twice as thick.  You can't really tell this from the images here, so be forewarned.It's ideal for use when traveling, especially if you have a GB network you can connect to, though obviously you can use it with lower-speed networks just as easily.  While I'd prefer a full Cat6 cable which was smaller and easier to carry, this is a fine choice until someone releases one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24BR1OM8P8IQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006J1EUA#wasThisHelpful","R24BR1OM8P8IQB","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, this cable is ridiculously expensive compared to many other options out there, first off...  so don't buy it unless you actually need the advantages it provides.  But if you DO need these advantages... by all means, buy this cable.The advantages, you ask?  Well...  portability, mainly, for me.  I can wrap this up in a little pouch along with my Roku and toss it in my luggage, taking up almost no space.Signal quality is excellent.  Of course, I've never seen a ""bad"" HDMI cable, at least not yet...  but this one, despite the tiny cable diameter, seems to be immune to EMI (electromagnetic interference) at any level I would ever expect to see, and the connections are good and solid.  The gold plating is of decent thickness, meaning it's not already ""wiping off"" (as often happens)...  which is critical for a cable to be used for ""portable"" purposes.And finally, the last ""advantage"" is the ease of routing the cable.  You could get four of these, coming from your TV, bundled together, and you'd have a smaller, more flexible ""cable cluster"" than even a single conventional HDMI cable would provide.If you don't need the thinner cable, don't bother spending the extra money.  But if you have cable-routing/cable-management issues, or if you want a very small, high-quality cable to take with you...  this is the best cable on the market today, in my opinion.EDIT:  One thing I realized I ought to add to this review (based upon some issues a friend had while trying to use mine)...  this isn't like your typical HDMI cable in one other way.Virtually all HDMI cables are symmetrical...  meaning that it doesn't matter, at all, which end you plug into your ""source"" and which end you plug into your ""endpoint.""  This cable is NOT symmetrical in that fashion.  It must... MUST..  be plugged in, in one specific orientation.  One end of the cable is clearly marked as going to the source, with the other going to the endpoint.If you disregard this, you'll fail to get an output signal.  In other words, in order to get this device as small as it is, there's something ""electronic"" going on in the termination plugs on each end.  Most HDMI cables just have conductors going through, without any electronics whatsoever.  This is not the case with this cable.So...  if you plug it in the wrong way (ie, if you don't bother to read the markings on the ends!), you won't get a signal out of the cable at all.  I'd always just followed the instructions, but a friend (as I mentioned) tried it the other way, and no signal was carried through from the source device to the display.Definitely something worth knowing, and sharing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8F1K57U8XPXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VFOHSY#wasThisHelpful","R8F1K57U8XPXC","A3MU9G6YWKTGTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MU9G6YWKTGTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are prettier than I thought they'd be - they look much like the photo, but better looking ""in person"" - curiosity had me order them, and the look of them will have me wearing them should that special occasion come where I need something a little ""fancier."" They'd be pretty at Christmas, or a fall party. They remind me of fall - pretty fall leaves in October.Don't order them expecting quality jewlery if you like expensive ""quality"" jewlery, but instead like fun ""costume"" jewlery. On my ears, they look sweet. Not something I'd wear often, and I'd even consider giving them to someone who prefers gold and sparkle. These are just fun sweet earrings to wear - again, if you like ""Good"" jewlery, then they may not be for you. If like me you wear lots of costume jewlery and don't care a whit about cost or how it's made, etc, then give them a try.At first, I thought the shiny part around the gemstone were those fake looking diamonds and I hate that look, but, I was delighted to see that it is actually a nice silver design, and I prefer that to fake diamonds. Under that is more gold in a ""filigree"" design that's also quite pretty.The gemstones are nice - I don't know a lot about gemstones and quality, I only know what appeals to my eye, and these are clear and the color vivid.Normally, I would not wear something gold, nor would I wear something that looks ""fancier"" but these are so pretty, I may wear them when the occasion warrants it (or maybe just because I feel like wearing something sparkly and pretty!). I know I'm using the word ""pretty"" a lot, but that's the main word I think about when I look at these earrings.I can't find the current pricing on these, so I can't do a ""cost to pleasure"" ratio, but if they are reasonably priced, I'd say Amazon has a good thing going with their ""Amazon Collection"" of jewelry for those - I am curious what else they have to offer and hope they offer some more unique interesting jewlery -- something that isn't so sparkly but instead more to my tastes--something more simple, and silver instead of gold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31UJHUU5LMV0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEFSUEA#wasThisHelpful","R31UJHUU5LMV0C","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit skeptical about this product when I agreed to try out these running thong underwear in exchange for an honest review, but I was curious. I ordered the medium even though I wear a size 4 pants -- and the medium is the just-right size (I'm 5'2"" and about 114 pounds).Right out of the package they look ""sturdy"" and well-made. I washed them before wearing and they washed very well (I washed them twice right out of the package to see how they'd wash) and no problems drying them in my dryer either.At first, when I put them on, they felt snug and I worried I'd be pulling at them during my run. I put on my running/yoga pants and set out - and actually just forgot I had them on! That's a good sign for me -- if I forget I'm wearing something, then it's a good fit and a good product for me. I did my run and there was no slipping at all. That ""snug"" fit served me well for my run. These thongs stayed put! No riding up or moving about -I was very pleased!I tried them out again but this time I just wore them about the house just to see how they felt, and again, I forgot I had them on.

"Length: Below ShouldersHair Type: very baby fine, highlightedupdate! -- this shampoo does much better as the mountain cove fall dry weather moves in.

I'd use this in the dry times of the year but not in the summer. 3.5!---------------------------Folks, this is a huge bottle of shampoo! It will last forever. Just a dollop will do, because this shampoo lathers to a full-out foaming lather. It has a creamy feel to it - and that makes the ""moisture rich"" claim to be true: this shampoo does go on creamy and rinses out to leave the hair strands soft and silky.However. It's too silky and creamy for my baby fine hair, and after drying it, soon I'm left with limp locks, which is too bad, since I do like the way it leaves my hair soft enough to comb through it easily.As I've been saying for other hair, face, and body wash products, I wish companies would give us some more interesting scents. I'm so bored with the slightly sweet powdery(ish) scents--please! Can we have some citrus, some woodsy, some spice!This shampoo could be better in the winter when my hair, and the mountain air, is drier. Or, for someone with thicker, drier hair.

"Update: there is some fading rather quickly--I don't know if it's something to do with my hair or shampoo or the product, or if that's just how coloring goes in general. But, it's not been but a couple of weeks and I've noticed my hair is already changing. I don't mind the color, and in fact, some of my high-lights are showing through a little so it makes it look nice, but, still worth noting. I won't change my 4 star (yet) to a 3 but I'm going to see how much more fading occurs.--------------------------Good thing I didn't read these reviews before I bought this (at a store in my little mountain town)! I spent about 20 minutes just staring at all the different types of hair coloring products --completely confused! It's been years since I've colored my own hair. I've been having it highlighted for 4-5 years and was ready for a change and to save some money. I had my boyfriend apply it for me - we followed the directions EXACTLY as they said to - no variations at all. It was easy and no drips or mess.Even with all the shaking, at the end there seemed to be more of an ammonia odor than at the beginning, so we applied almost all of the product and worked it in real good to be sure - I have below shoulder-length hair so needed most of it anyway. I don't have many greys, so that's not an issue. I just wanted to even out my hair color and become close to my natural - within a shade or two lighter.After leaving in the 30 minutes exactly (after working it all in from roots to ends just as the directions state - so actually it's on your hair a bit longer at the roots), I rinsed it out -- my hair felt a little ""rough"" but after I used the conditioner, it was silky feeling.After rinsing and conditioning, I had it cut, and then I blew it dry. I was very happy with the shine and bounce and body! I haven't had shine and bounce and body for years!Now here is the ""warning"" -- I have medium-dark brown hair naturally - my highlights were a very light brown or very dark blonde - I chose the 600 Light Brown because I was afraid of going too dark after having lighter hair for so long - and because since I have partial highlights, i had my dark hair throughout and ""underneath"" -- good thing I chose the lighter color because it would have been too dark at the ends! I would consider going one shader darker next time, just to more match my natural color, but this color is nice enough. It's hard to know how the color will be with subsequent colorings since I did color over highlights, but it looks very natural. No one would know I colored it if I didn't tell them.The color isn't exactly as I would like it to be, but that's more the color I chose in relation to my uneven highlights and re-growth there with dark hair and light hair and strippy stuff where my highlights were growing out unevenly and not a reflection of the product -- I am curious to see what my hair will look like next time: I will try this product again in one shade darker for a more ""richer"" look and I am expecting great results.I have a pic to show the color - this was right after I blew it dry - a simple blow out with a round brush - nothing fancy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4SGSVS0MQT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5E81WY#wasThisHelpful","R2X4SGSVS0MQT7","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, there isn't a lot to say about cotton dishtowels!Are they ""attractive?"" - these aren't the prettiest dishtowels, but I didn't want pretty--I wanted a dishtowel I wouldn't mind if it becomes stained or a little frizzled from wear and tear. I wanted to scrub and wash and dry and generally give them a good ole kitchen workout. So, to that end, they are not beautiful but they are functional!Do they wash well?  - I've washed them and dried them and so far they are holding up fine. I can see where over time they'll look ""worn out"" but again, that won't bother me. They are a bit thinner than some dishtowels I have, so I do have a little concern they'll start tearing and looking a little worse for wear, but they also seem pretty sturdy, so there's that.Are they absorbent? - First thing I did after washing/drying them was to put one under the faucet to see how absorbent it is. It seemed to resist the water a little at first but I was able to wring it out and then use it to wipe the counters down without left-over water residue. Over time, with repeated washing, I expect the towels to become more water absorbent.

"I was a trainer for 6 years, and often used bands for alternatives to weight machines or free-weights--both for myself and for my clients. When I was asked to try these free in exchange for a review, I hesitated: often, in my past experience, exercise bands were not of good quality, and I've had them tear and snap in the middle of a work out. However, I was curious, so I agreed.First, the bands arrived in a nice mesh bag - where they can be stored when not in use: this is great, since I like things put away, and as well, to keep the bands clean, neat, organized, and to keep them from being damaged.I was also impressed with the sizes/resistance qualities of the bands; from very light up to very difficult. I have used these over the last two weeks to work out my entire body - including squats. Not only do they ""replace"" my free-weights and my tubing to give me a different work out, the different sizes/resistance quality makes for an easy, convenient, and fun addition to my resistance training. Also, I was able to do an anaerobic workout by working out my entire body without stopping--going from one muscle group to the other without stopping - very easy to pick up the ""weight"" I need from the bands and go to town on them!The ""weight"" resistance is noted on each band, but after a time, one could know by the color which one to grab (not only that, you can tell the resistance quality by the look of the bands: very very light is much thinner whereas very very heavy is much thicker)--or by the easy to read ""weight"" resistance quality marked on each band.These are also great for stretching while you are workout out, or stretching at the end of your workout.I'd recommend these as a great addition to any workout. The best workouts are the ones we will do. As well, the best training is when we mix up and change up our workouts--resistance bands are a good way to do this. I'm happy, and will purchase these as a gift for a family member who cannot use free-weights or go to the gym to use their equipment. These can be very gentle on the body - good for starting out a resistance training regime or if you have areas of concern (always see your doc before starting an exercise program!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TF12Z34E23AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WVO3X2A#wasThisHelpful","R3TF12Z34E23AG","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also smoothed some on without a washcloth just to see how it felt and whatever is in that gel does create a soft and silky feel! I don't have that dry feeling to my skin after showering--the air can be really dry here in the mountains, so having an emollient product is important. After towel-drying off, my skin feels great. That's the best thing about this shower/bath gel.What I don't care for is the scent. There isn't much scent to it-it's quite subtle, which is fine, but as I've said before with other products, why can't companies create better scents for women? It almost smells ""plastic."" Men have all these wonderful woodsy, citrusy, spicy scented products, while companies think women want flowery or ""grandmother from the sixties"" scents--I'm a grandmother but I don't want to smell like my grandmother did. I'd love a shower gel, soaps, face washes, etc, in spicy, citrus, woodsy scents. This gel scent rather bores me. But, I am giving it four stars because it does what it claims to do and there's not a 3.5 star option: makes my skin feel soft and silky and clean. But, please, y'all - give us women some stronger more assertive scents for gawd's sake!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2M2DRMBET9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VR1JA#wasThisHelpful","R2H2M2DRMBET9Q","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to like this hand lotion more than I do, but I can't be very excited about it enough to want to purchase it. What's good about it is it's a thick, emollient hand lotion that when applied softens my hands--but so do many other hand lotions for half the price and at a better scent. What makes it not exciting is that for the price at this size (see photo), it doesn't live up to that price standard. I think the marketers/creators of this hand lotion should give it an exotic spicy scent, or something citrus, or woodsy, so that, like another well-known brand sold in hair salons, there is that feeling of decadence or a ""spa-like"" experience. This lotion's scent is like grandma (and I'm a grandmother, but I don't want to smell like MY grandmother). There is also an almost ""chemical"" scent to the ""grandma flowery"" scent. As well, it takes a while for the lotion to soak into my skin, so if I'm at my computer working on a novel, I have to wait a while--it's a little greasy--yet, that wouldn't be so bad since when it does soak in, my hands do feel great.So, in general, give this lotion an ""exotic"" or citrus'y scent and/or give a little bit more for the money, and I'd be more inclined to purchase it. Honestly, just changing the scent would do a lot to pique my interest in this product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWARFPOKOANJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052OUDLU#wasThisHelpful","RWARFPOKOANJH","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't belive how nice this TeiKis set was when I opened the Amazon box. I received this set free in exchange for an honest review and I since I love giving positive reviews, I am always hopeful the product will be nice; because when the product doesn't deliver what it promises, I have to give a less than positive review whether receiving free or purchasing it -- this set goes above and beyond nice. My guy's really excited to use this on his grill, but I have my eye on this set, too!The set is not only beautiful, but there are more than enough tools for grilling, or for ""indoor cooking."" I used the knife (photos below) to cut into a lemon just to see how sharp it was - sliced right through. Though not meant to cut a side of beef, this knife will be great for multi-purpose all around cutting up of veggies, fruit, and even meat for inside or the grill. There's tongs, and a cleaning brush, and a ""spatula,"" some steak knives, corn holders, a themometer --everything you need.It all comes in a nice carrying case to keep the tools not only from scratching up but to keep them organized - and if you want to keep the tools outside, you can slip this carrying ""briefcase"" where you keep your grill.It comes with a meat thermometer - something I had a need of and now I can try out this one. I took a pic of the entire set - it's just as the Amazon photo advertised: and this doesn't always happen with products, believe me. I can't think of anything at all missing from this collection. And, as well, I can't think of anything bad to say. Once we get to cookin' and grillin' with these tools, I'm excited to see how they hold up. If there is any problem at all, and I don't anticipate a thing going wrong - I will of course be back to report it in an ""update,"" as I always try to do as I try out products over time.These tools would make a great gift set, and I already have it on my Christmas Ideas List for friends/family members who love to grill. Very nice set; quite nice looking; and a bargain for the price!----------I also received at the same time the BBQ injector, gloves, and meat ""hands"" or shredders - I tried to leave a review on that particular product page but couldn't - kept taking me here. So, while the BBQ tool set made me more excited and happy, this set (photo below) will be used just as happily. Especially the injector--stainless steel with two injecting ""needles"" that you just screw in. The ""hands"" can be used to pull out hot meat--using the thick thick heat-resistant gloves--or I think for shredding meat if you are so inclined. The gloves are super thick. The ""hands/shredders"" are a hard plastic-type material--I'd imagine they'd stay more ""cool to the touch"" - but again, the injector is the star in this three-piece set.Looking forward to having years of use of out of these products!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YDLDERWXCNJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5LE3JK#wasThisHelpful","R1YDLDERWXCNJ9","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: - the more I use these Calily oils, the better I like them. This morning I put in my atomizer grapefruit and orange in my bedroom, and in the bathroom I put peppermint -- both rooms scented with happy energetic scent. I continue to be impressed with this product.------------------I received these oils in exhange for a review (I just paid shipping costs), and I couldn't be happier with them! In fact, I was quite pleasantly surprised at the quality of not only the product (the oils) but the packaging. These would make a great gift. The oils are attractively displayed in a nice-looking sturdy box. The scents are varied - some of my favorites are lavender, spearmint, lemon, bergamot, eucalyptus, and more. A few drops are all you need, for these oils are potent, but without being over-poweringly scented. There are no ""artificial"" odors and that makes the experience even more pleasant. I put a few drops into an atomizer I have and let the steam waft the scent into the room: LOVE! I want to try some other methods of delivery, as well. Be mindful to wash your hands if any oil spills onto your skin, as it is strong stuff and could cause irritation, but simply washing your hands with soap and water takes care of that if you are sensitive to the oils.I want to purchase a box of these for a friend (or two or three!) - a really attractive wide-varied array of aromatherapy oils.

"I'm torn on whether to give this 3 or 4 stars, simply because it just isn't for me.

From the photo, I thought it had more of a ""white background backing"" but it's completely see-through.

If I put aside the fact that I'm not a ""lace person,"" I was willing to try it out for my guest bathroom, but upon receiving it, there is no way it'll work as a shower curtain.

But, I won't be hanging this. I'm trying to figure out just what to do with it - but really, I'll just be giving it away as it does not fit my decor at all. I should have known better when I saw the word ""lace"" - so in that regard it is not the company's fault but my own.

"You can't go wrong with Aveeno products.

"Hair type: below shoulder length, baby fine, hi-lightedI wasn't sure what to think about this product when I first poured some onto my palms---it is an ""oily-feeling"" treatment, and I feared it would make my baby fine hair look greasy. In fact, I knew I'd put too much onto my hands, and wiped some of it away, so a little will go a long way (this product will last me forever!). I then worked the infusion from about ear-length down to the ends into my just-washed hair--I did not put any at the roots. Then I blow-dried with a round brush. At first, I didn't think it did much, but when I walked out of the bathroom, my guy said, ""Wow! Your hair looks beautiful! What did you do differently?"" He ran his fingers through it, ""it's soft and silky - sexy!""I marched back into the bathroom and looked at my hair - yup, smooth, shiny, and silky all right. And after sleeping on it all night - even tossing and turning -- I woke to smooth silky hair! Okay, so, I'm sold!If you have baby fine hair as I do, don't over-do it -- just use maybe a dime-sized at most, and don't apply it to the roots - also, work it in really well into wet/damp hair, and then blow dry with a round brush--though I want to try it without blow drying to see what it will do.

"These are the strangest little berries -- and so beautiful in color, I put them in a jar and keep them on my kitchen counter. They have an intense flavor that starts out a little sweet and ends up with this unique weird after taste that I both love and am not so sure about (laugh) -- my brother ate a handful and said ""Mmm, these are good - wait!  I don't know - they aren't so good - but then they are. . . .?"" That's the Goji berry experience for some. I happen to like the unique taste, and that almost kind of ""burn"" in the throat (not in a bad way, just a strange way). I'll eat a handful right out of the bag (or jar) but note that they are not moist but rather ""hardened"" and dry. However, they can be soaked in water and added to recipes or made into a tea. But I prefer them as a snack out of the bag or added to my trail mix.They do become very dry - perhaps I didn't store them properly.

"age: 50sskin type: senstive with slight rosaceaI love and adore this serum!

I've had people comment, asking what I've done to my skin. It appears softer, ""brighter,"" smoother. There is absolutely no irritation for my sensitive skin, either. I've used only Oz Natural products, exclusively, over the months so I could better see how my skin reacts.

Though the lotion is relatively thick, it goes on silky smooth, and there is absolutely no greasy afterfeel at all. Afterwards, my skin feels amazing--soft and smooth and hydrated.The bottle should last a good while--not a lot is needed, just a few pumps will cover  your entire body. Great for after shaving, too--smooths and calms the skin.I was a big fan of another brand, and while I do still love that brand, I'm sold on this Curel now, and will be trying out more of their products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ZLTD1J4NBS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NKFU98#wasThisHelpful","R5ZLTD1J4NBS5","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not big on putting ""supplements"" into the environment - where I'm going back home to is on a little mountain where everything is wooded and ""natural"" - there is not a yard and everything grows wild as it would and does in the woods. However, where I've lived for the past near-year is a house in the suburbs with a yard and a pool. So, this product is perfect for that -- except for the pool part, which there has to be care taken that no product runoff is in the pool - easy enough in the front and side yards, and fairly easy in the backyard if one is careful not to over-soak.The bottle is easy to attach to the yard-hose, and there is a ""switch"" for water only or feed. No mixing required - just attach, turn on water, set to feed (or just water), and depress ""trigger."" I have small hands and though I'm pretty strong, it was a little difficult to keep the ""trigger"" depressed for very long, but some gloves, or switching hands, would work fine.I can't comment as yet on grass growth, but from other reviews I've read, this product delivers. My brother, for whom the yard belongs to, is excited about this turf builder, and I'll be leaving the bottle with him when I move back to my mountain.Can't go wrong with Scotts - it's been around a long time!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IHAT7PJHC0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009QAJ6VO#wasThisHelpful","R15IHAT7PJHC0J","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to give this FIVE stars because of the construction of this product -- it's extremely well-made. However, I will write off the bat here that this armband is way too large for me and will be too large for anyone my size or perhaps even anyone who isn't much bigger than I am: I'm 5'2"" and less than 115 pounds. I almost could fit this around my entire waist (if I really tried, and actually, I did!) And the length of it spanned too much of my upper arm rendering it useless for me, unfortunately--I couldn't tighten it enough and it spanned from my shoulder to my elbow in a way that it would be in the way of my activities.All that aside, if you have a large enough and long enough arm and need something that will not only hold your phone, but credit cards and license and some money and some keys and your earphones and a small dog (laughing- okay, not a small dog, but this thing is ROOMY), this will be a great product for you. There is a nice cushion to it that will feel great on your arm so you don't feel the items inside, but also will protect the items inside as you go about your workout or whatever.I received this free in exchange for a review and since I'm always honest, I hate giving such a well-made product 3 stars, and, since this product is so well made in a Five Star way, I know there will be those out there who will do fine with it, it is just too big for my body type, and for the type of workouts I do. It's hard to fault the company on some of that, but since they do call it a ""sports armband"" it has to be reasonable to assume one could use it in that way, and I, and perhaps others, will have problems in that area.Really, folks, this thing is huge. I just don't know. Unless you are a really Big person, and need to carry a lot of items with you when you are exercising or running or whatever, it's hard for me to imagine this thing on anyone's arm. I do heavy treadmill aerobics, and this would never work for me. Then again, man is this thing well made. I'm so on the fence about it. I think I shall give it to a man friend and let him tell me what he thinks!So, if you are looking for an armband to carry many items, feels comfortable (if you are a large enough person), and something very well-constructed, then this is for you. If, like me, you are smaller, it may not work for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2480T8YYL0GVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9AV4VW#wasThisHelpful","R2480T8YYL0GVE","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skin type: sensitveHair type: very baby fineage: 50sPackaged in an amber glass bottle with a dropper style application. Thick but not too thick ""amber colored"" oil.At first I didn't think I was going to like this Avocado Oil product. Many times ""oil"" products leave an oily film on my skin and it drives me crazy. But, the company was so kind and so enthusiastic about their product, and offered me a bottle to try in exchange for an honest review so that i was curious. Since I'm always honest, I was afraid I'd have to come on here and say I didn't care for their product. First off, when I received the product, it was packaged in a plain white box without any ""frills""  - okay, not so bad; after all, why spend money on fancy packaging? The bottle itself looks fine, but when I opened it and droppered some onto the palm of my hand, I was not happy with the scent--it's not an unpleasant or ""bad"" scent, just not one that I particularly like. As well, of course since it is an oil, it feels oily! But, I made a promise to try it and try it I would. I decided to apply this avocado oil over my entire body - hair included. A little goes a long way, y'all! I smoothed the oil over my face, lips, hair, my feet--paying extra attention to my heels, and over the rest of my body.My worries about it being too oily feeling were short-lived--this stuff absorbed into my skin very nicely! I was surprised! And my skin felt amazingly soft. It also helped with the heels of my feet -- I go barefoot a lot and have to work to keep my feet looking smooth and nice. This avocado oil will work amazing for my feet/heels. There was no irritation for my sensitive facial skin, either. I'd use this on my face maybe once or twice a week, but I more would want to use it on my body.Now, as for my hair--I would use this to deep condition my hair once a month or so, but it did make my hair look very oily. I thought it may absorb into my hair as it did my skin, but I woke to very oily hair, and I didn't use much. So, knowing that, I'd only use it as an occasional hair conditioning treatment.The scent didn't last too long, and it wasn't strong enough to put me off too much -- but I did apply a lotion to my arms and shoulders and chest just to mask the scent of the avocado product. That would be my one ""negative"" and really it's not much of a negative.I'll continue to use the product and see how it does for my skin when I move back to the dry-air climate of the mountains. That should make my skin even happier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SY6DESB7KMGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFACF3A#wasThisHelpful","R3SY6DESB7KMGY","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came back to give this 5 stars because it's really been a great cable ""manager"" - I travel a lot and this has helped me be just a little more organized.I read the reviews on this cable keeper and hesitated. I wasn't sure I wanted to try it. With any product I agree to try or that I purchase, I of course want to be sure I'm going to enjoy it, use it, really like it--because I love giving positive reviews when warranted. I'm always honest, but when I choose products I know I need and/or will enjoy, giving a positive review feels great.I was about to click out of the product description, when I looked down and saw the cords of my iPhone and iPad and keyboard and bluetooth earphones and and and - dang! So I decided to give this cable keeper manager a try.Now, there is only one cable keeper and for the price, I may hesitate buying if I'd just purchased this one for $12. Since I received it through Vine, I can purchase another one and the price won't seem out of line (two for $12.00). But, paying $12 for each one--I truly am on the fence about that. For, the good thing about this product is that: It was very easy to zip up my phone cords -- I have two in it now and I can plug in two connectors/adapters at once in the same outlet area, which will be awesome when I want to charge my phone and tablet at once without wires snaking everywhere. -I just thread the top part of my cords into the ""hole"" provided, and then just zipped it up and the cords easily positioned inside; there's room enough for two cords, which is what I did and I like. You can fold up a longer cord to make it neater but that defeats the purpose of the longer cord I have when I need a longer cord so I don't see the point in that unless it's for storage purposes. I like the idea of using these for storing the many cords I have and the cords my guy has when we are together. The blue is a pretty color; I can bend the cable keeper so that it stays put--for example, if I want to curl it up or fold it a few times, it stays that way; it seems to be quality made; it really did neaten up my cords; it looks more ""organized"" than when I have white cables flopping about every-which-a-way.All in all, I'm happy with this product. Happier than I thought I'd be, because of my initial skepticism. If they lowered the price just a little, I would buy a few more for friends/family. I am considering purchasing another one for myself at the price for which it is now offered. I do understand that a company must make profits--they can't make quality products and lose money, and so for that reason, why not spend a little extra on an item that works well? As a novelist, I know what it's like to have your ""product"" sold very cheaply but I also understand that this is how Amazon works and in the long run, your ""product"" gains a very wide audience through Amazon.Some considerations: I would like it made in varying lengths. I think putting it on sale for a while would benefit the manufacturer.  However, overall, I'm happier with the product than I thought I'd be, and I'm using it, so there you go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZV3TBQIKKKP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRGBNG0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZV3TBQIKKKP6","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skin type: very sensitive and prone to occasional breakoutsage: 50sComes in a nice-sized plastic bottle with pump application. Do not use very much of this product - you don't need to. A dime sized or so should give you enough cleanser on your dampened face. Using too much cleanser is only wasting it! And that goes for any cleanser or beauty product.I have weird skin. A product may seem to work and then wreak havoc on my face. It's part of the reason I joined the Vine program - my cabinets were full of product I'd spent money on that I'd have to give away or throw away. So when I find something that works, I hang on to it! I first ""judge"" a product by scent, how much is offered for the money, how it feels when I apply it to my skin, and then how my skin feels afterward--lately, as well, I am more and more looking at how it is made and what goes into the product. As for long term use, only time can tell for some beauty products, but for cleansers, since they do not stay on the face long, I can tell how much I will like them after only a few days or so of use. What I look for in a cleanser is one that does not have any ""grit"" or other kinds of ""scrubbing"" or ""exfoliating"" actions to them since they make tiny microscopic tears in the skin - particularly as you age. I exfoliate with my Clarisonic Mia or a soft cloth a couple of times a week. This routine works well for my aging skin. Neutrogena Cleanser is gentle enough to use the exfoliation that Mia provides without irritating my face.This Nuetrogena isn't organic or made from ""all natural"" ingredients as some of the products I do now use, but I wanted to try it anyway since I trust the Nuetrogena name, and as I earlier wrote, facial cleansers do not stay on the face long enough for me to worry as much. I pump out about a dime sized amount of the cleanser and slightly rub it between my fingers and then apply to my dampened face. Sometimes I'll use my Clarisonic Mia and others I'll use only my fingertips to cleanse my face in cirucular motions.The cleanser is soft and silky on my skin, and it has a very light but pleasant scent. I don't like heavy perfumy scents, and especially in my cleansers I prefer a lighter fresh scent.After cleansing, my face feels soft and silky. The price at under $8 here on Amazon is reasonable for the amount received. I'd consider purchasing this when the bottle is empty - but this bottle should last me quite some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232CI629W02ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YWC6#wasThisHelpful","R232CI629W02ND","A1A25TP5D0L22V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A25TP5D0L22V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These plastic measuring cups are in the Kitchen-Aid branded colors - ceramic white with black handles. They are handsome looking. They nest together well and aren't terribly deep, which I like for my particular shallow kitchen drawer. They have a flat bottom, so they sit on a counter evenly. I have two things I dislike. The first is the ring that holds the cups together: It is connected/clasped by a different type of transparent flexible plastic, one I expect to get lost or ruined in a dishwasher. Secondly, the measurements are printed on the handle in silver. Having had other printed cups wear off over time, I don't expect this paint to be durable. I would much prefer a raised molded number.

"Upwords is a play on grid-based word games like Scrabble. You build words that are not scored based on the rarity of letters, but on the number of tiles used. Letters played on the lower levels receive two points per tile, each letter played above that receives one - but you get to count every tile below that when making a new word by stacking. So there is a fair amount of strategy and inventiveness.The instructions are a tad vague as to scoring. It wasn't immediately clear that the lowest levels counted for two points, and the upper levels *and* lower levels when made into a new word, counted for one apiece. But once you figure it out, it's relatively easy to keep score.The board is plastic, with some felt feet on the corners. The pieces are white plastic. The trays for holding letters are rather flimsy. All told, though, it works just fine and nothing seems prone to breakage. I think it would have been nice to include a felt bag for the letters, in the style of Scrabble.This is a fun, quick alternative to Scrabble. A game can easily be played in less than 30 minutes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUBE75ODNFU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V82MFSY#wasThisHelpful","ROUBE75ODNFU8","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do I want from a toaster oven? Capacity, easy cleanup, and control. Well, the Hamilton Beach 31401 offers 2 out of 3 unproblematically, but the third is a bit more complicated (literally and figuratively).First, the positives. When the box claims that it can fit four slices of bread, it means it. I was using some particularly wide Pepperidge Farm bread, and I could still easily get 4 slices in. I used this to keep a batch of fried fish warm, too, and it fit the entire pound of fried cod with room to spare. All in all, I doubt anyone would be displeased. The rack slides out, albeit not automatically like some competing products. So you so need to shield your hand to do so. The toasting action is even across the oven (easy to test with 4 slices), and the stated ""oven"" temperatures seem accurate, too. Cleanup is not difficult, with an easy slide-out panel.My issue with the thing is the control scheme. As you can see in the picture, there are three knobs. The top is temperature, the middle is mode, and bottom is timer (I guess). The bottom knob has two little icons - a light piece of toast and a dark piece. The space between these icons is... well, there IS no space between them. It's like playing a game of Operation! trying to find just he right ""click"" for the dial. It is easy to over or undershoot. Then, in addition, the temperature dial at top has to be set correctly to toast. Why would these interact at all? Toasting should have a hard-wired ""correct"" temp, and should disable the temperature knob altogether. We had several toasting failures because of this. My only presumption can be that the innards of this thing are entirely mechanical, and so it is a ""dumb"" toaster oven, so to speak. If you turn a knob, it does its thing, regardless of the mode you're in.Because it does what it sets out to do quite ably (once you figure out the controls), I give it 4 stars. But the hair trigger and the wonky dial scheme won't let me go any higher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAH12ZOMX8P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YUDYVM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAH12ZOMX8P8","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not reviewing the game. It's the same Chutes and Ladders it's always been. Rather insipid for anyone over the age of 6, I'd say. No strategy, just counting.What I will review is the board, graphics, and pieces. This is a 70's retro design. I haven't played the 70's version (or at least haven't in 30 years or more), so I can't comment on the accuracy. I did like the pictures - they show little morality tales. Hard-working children who do nice things are at the bottom of each ladder, and are rewarded at the top for their labors. Lazy or mean kids are at the top of each chute, and get heir comeuppance at the bottom. My son (who is 4) enjoyed looking at each pairing and discussing how and why they succeeded or failed.That said, the board is rather busy, and it isn't entirely clear to a younger person which square corresponds to which chute or ladder.The game pieces are sturdy, though the plastic brackets are difficult for little fingers to insert the cardboard children into. The spinner works well once you punch it through. Spinning action is easy and can go for more than a few seconds.All in all, it's the same boring game it's always been.

"It is difficult to evaluate the claims of this product, because it claims to strengthen your core and improve posture. To the extent that any sort of ""ball seat"" does this, I believe this product would do so as well.As such, I will evaluate it on comfort and ease of use. The cushion is not terribly heavy, but it does seem sturdy, It comes pre-inflated, and seems rather squishy at first blush. But this is actually a good level of inflation, because it lets you sink in a tad while still supporting your rear-end. The color is unobtrusive in an office setting, and the diameter should fit most chairs. The nubbed texture gives you a bit of traction on the cushion, and isn't unpleasant.One thing I don't particularly like is that it requires a pin to inflate. The pin is included, but it is just taped onto the box, so it is easy to overlook, and as a small part is easy to lose. There is no pump included, either. I assume this is because the manufacturer believes that anyone buying this would also have a yoga ball. But is that really the case?All in all, this is a good cushion for those who want to try core strengthening through sitting.

"So here are my criteria for evaluating a dress shirt:-Are the sleeves baggy? Here, the answer is no. They are a pleasing width that doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing the Hammer Pants of shirts.-Is it a wrinkle nightmare? Again, no. Although it is not wrinkle resistant by any means, it was very easy to steam out the wrinkles, and even just being in a bathroom while I showered did the trick for most of them.-Are the buttons difficult to pass through the holes? Here, the answer is kind of. I would have liked a few more microns of clearance, personally.-Is it itchy? I'm going to say no. It's not smooth like silk, but it has a pleasing feel overall.-Does it have pockets? No! No pockets! I was taken a bit aback by this, as I looked for a place to stow my sunglasses. So I guess you should be aware of this fact before buying. It's not a defect, but a matter of taste.-Can I lift my arms without untucking the whole darned thing? This is an in-between answer.

"This is a review of the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 1040. It is a 1080p LCD projector lit by a UHP lamp. As its name indicates, it is intended to be a home theater projector, not a business presentation projector. Nonetheless, Epson boasts that this can produce 3,000 Lumens, which is enough to compete with some serious room lighting.I am a recent entrant into the projector game, having purchased an LG PF1500 LED-based DLP projector (also 1080p). That unit retails for about $100 more than this one, but they are both entry-level home theater projectors. As such, I think a comparison between them is fruitful.***Image Quality***The PowerLite certainly provides a crisp image. It was extremely easy to dial in the focus using the recessed focus dial, and the focus uniformity was even across the screen. It certainly felt as though all of the information from a Blu-Ray disc was being displayed on the screen (in this case a Vapex 1.1 gain 106"" white screen).The real weakness of this projector is its baseline black level. The darkest areas on the screen never dip below a dull gray, even with the Auto Iris engaged. I would compare these blacks to a budget LCD television like an Insignia or a Seiki. The LG PF1500, which is an entry-level DLP, handily beats it (please see the appended images for comparison, taken at the same ISO and shutter speed on the same screen image. The first is the PF1500, the second is the PowerLite 1040).As such, this would not be my first choice for a home theater projector. It simply doesn't get dark enough to let me immerse myself in the image and ""forget"" I'm looking at a projection on a screen. Movies with black bars (such as ""Ben-Hur,"" which I used in the screen shots) make this especially evident. 16:9 material (such as Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey) less so.With that said, please also see the third image I took of the 1040 with full room lighting. This IS definitely a projector to consider if you want to use it as a daytime TV (keeping in mind that you will need an external tuner or cable box with HDMI output) with minimal light control in your room (say just some blinds), or a projector to use in the office.***Build Quality***There are a host of nice hardware features. A lens cover is built in. Focus and zoom dials are recessed and are nice and firm, never falling out of position. The unit itself is not gargantuan by any means, weighing in at about 8 pounds and measuring about 10""x13""x4"". The power cord is a standard 3-prong PC plug, with no external power brick. This simplifies installation considerably. Standard mounting holes are on the bottom. The included remote is functional and reasonably organized, but not backlit. This projector does not feature a TV tuner or 3D, and has no onboard streaming functions, though it does connect to a home network for image sharing. The fan noise in Eco mode is admirably quiet. It is almost inaudible when the projector is mounted, and is even tolerable when sitting right next to it. Regular mode is another story - quite noisy.***Calibration***I performed a DIY calibration with Disney WOW. Contrast adjustment was ineffective using the Disney WOW disc - no value for contrast would show white bars on the right side of the pattern.

"On the pro side, and it's a very big pro, I like the flat wall plug. It really aids in installations behind couches and cabinets, which most home theater/entertainment center applications will need. I was able to nestle this power strip behind a cabinet a mere 2 inches from the wall. I also like the sliding covers for unused outlets.On the minus side, this strip doesn't feature any sort of differentiation between standard 2-prong plugs for smaller gear and ""wall wart"" power adapters, which a lot of the random stuff you might need near your TV (Chromecast or Fire Stick, Internet router) might need. As such, you are almost certain to have one or more unused plugs that are blocked by a wall wart's overhang.All in all, I like something like the Smart Strip better, since it has size differentiation and shuts off individual outlets to reduce ""vampire power.""

"Our baby enjoys this, and has found some pleasure in all three of the ""rings."" The top piece has a rubber cat he likes to chew, and the other rings offer interesting textures and are easily graspable.My only beef with this toy is the top - since it doesn't slide all the way down onto the middle post, it constantly invites the parent to pick this up and have it all fall apart while tidying up.

"So, this does what it says: Offers a portable 3,000 mAh power source that can charge devices that charge via USB. As the instructions indicate, it is better suited to phones than tablets, but it will charge them, albeit slowly. 3,000 mAh is more than most typical smartphones outside of the very biggest, so think of it as at least one more full charge, sometimes two, over your device's built in battery.There are one or two nagging flaws with this unit. First of all, though it has an LED indicator, it doesn't tell you much. It lights when the unit is charging another device, and it blinks when you're below 25% remaining on the unit. But from any point between 100% and 25%, your guess is as good as anyone's. It would have been nice if there had been a 4 step indicator, that is, 4 LED lights that show at least in quarters how full the unit is. I have a camera attachment for my smartphone that does this, and you can press a button at any time to see how much is remaining.The other irritation is the placement of the two USB ports. The ports are to charge the unit (from a wall or computer) and to discharge the unit (into your device). But they are so close together that it is difficult to have both be plugged in simultaneously. Now, this is probably a rare use case, but it could come up occasionally if you don't want to stow one of your cables while the other is in use.Anyway, it's a simple and useful charger at a good price. It could just have had a slightly more thoughtful design and a more useful indicator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MFVLVMA3DEUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRK8I7O#wasThisHelpful","R2MFVLVMA3DEUD","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are these knives more interesting-looking than the average knife? Sure. But I think the design ends up harming the convenience of these knives in terms of storage - they are too wide to fit into my wooden knife block in any slot but the one for the cleaver.  The knives are very heavy, which may lead to some fatigue during extended use. As far as cutting food, they work fabulously. The weight does lend itself to easy cuts, since you can let the knife do most of the work. The knives cut ripe tomatoes with absolutely no tearing or mashing of the fruit, so I was quite impressed.These knives come packaged in a faintly ridiculous glass and metal case with a foam insert. The instructions indicate that one can wash these in a dishwasher, but that it would be better to hand wash to preserve sharpness.Overall, I can recommend them as knives, but if you have limited storage space, they might not be for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CE6KKSGXSYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAOILUK#wasThisHelpful","R10CE6KKSGXSYY","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are comparing this scale to our previous Health-O-Meter electric scale. One thing the Taylor scale has over our previous electric scale is that it requires no waiting to turn on. You just step on, and it begins weighing you. It seems more accurate than our previous Health-O-Meter scale, as well, which seemed to only get to .2 pound increments and seemed to always add weight to the measurement. The Taylor gets to .1 pound increments and consistently reports the same weight upon repeat measurements. It also seems to weigh your clothes very accurately, so strip down!The profile setup system works well, with just a few button presses necessary to indicate which (of four) profiles you are, your height, sex, age, and activity level. Then, if you weigh yourself on a profile (selected before weighing with some arrow keys on the left of the unit), it will tell you your BMI and the recommended number of calories to maintain that weight. While of course these numbers won't be perfectly accurate, they are a nice start to being aware of your choices.The scale is very low profile and is completely flat. It feels very stable, but I will say I liked the curved aspect of our previous scale in terms of keeping a person on it. Being glass, you might find it nearly invisible on your floor, so be careful and avoid any Kramer moments!For the price, this really can't be beat.

"I am comparing this to the TP-Link TLPA-211 powerline kit, released a few years ago. The short version: this Netgear kit performs equally well, with far easier installation, for a competitive price.The long version: when Netgear says ""plug and play,"" they MEAN it. The TP-Link required multiple attempts with a laptop linked up to get it to sync with the second unit, and if you unplugged one of them, it was all over and you had to go through the onerous process again. The Netgear was this simple - I plugged in the first unit and hooked up the LAN cable from the router, then went to the next room and plugged in the second unit, hooking up the LAN cable to my devices (I connected a TV, PS3, and AV Receiver). That's it. No button presses. No syncing. Certainly no fiddling with software. Plug and play.Performance wise, I get my full 30 mbps down and 10 mbps up from my internet provider. So I can be certain the powerline units are no bottleneck. I haven't tried streaming video from one PC to another, as this is not something useful in my setup. It also has a hardware ""firewall"" of sorts, making the network connection impregnable, though I haven't tried it yet.But really, at this price, you can't go wrong.

"I am reviewing this unit in comparison to a Waterpik WP 900 combination electric brush and water irrigation kit. I have to say, in comparison to that kit's brush, I like this one better. It has a few things going for it - the Oral B heads offer great variety, and the included head has lots of swishing action across the whole brush head. The brush itself has two very nice features in its 30 second timer (it buzzes and lights green every thirty seconds, helping you time different mouth areas) and its pressure alert (a red LED blinks when you apply undue pressure in your mouth). These two features make you really aware of your brushing behavior, something the Waterpik does not. I wish the brush had dimmer LEDs that didn't blink so aggressively. At night, this brush had me turning it every which way to try to obscure the light at bedtime.As far as the bluetooth functions go, I was unable to test them, as I use Windows Phone. I realize this will not affect 90% of smartphone users, but it does me. The app purports to track brush usage over time to offer improvement advice.In comparing this to the Waterpik WP 900 (available on Amazon), the Oral B is a superior brush but includes no flossing element. The Waterpik also costs significantly less. As such, It's not a slam dunk recommendation. If you prefer lots of data and lots of brush head choices, this might be the one to go with. But if you want a decent brush sans bluetooth, and an excellent water flosser, the WP-900 might be the way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYPLI0YWSZTQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8ODI5I#wasThisHelpful","RYPLI0YWSZTQG","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife reports that there are several uncomfortable aspects to this underwear. The cut of the underwear hits her in weird places, and not because it's shaping underwear, but because they just come up too high. Theoretically this would be a good thing, but it hits in a weird place and ends up rolling down (my wife is post-pregnancy for what it's worth). The rear of the panty also does nothing to shape, unlike Maidenform's brand of shaping underwear. It is just flat fabric. There is a tag on the side seam that is very uncomfortable.

Despite not having tons to ""control"" down there, the long bottom part of the camisole rides up incessantly, creating an unsightly bulge underneath the parts that are actually being controlled.

"This product was relatively easy to install on one of my two toilets. The one it didn't work in was too small to accommodate the device without it interfering with the various elements of the toilet mechanism. But in our more spacious toilet, it worked fine, once it was placed on the side of the toilet away from the plunger lever. Unfortunately, this led to the purple clip of the tablet holder showing from the front of the toilet. I wish it has been white or beige, which are far more common toilet colors than purple.Once installed, it's a matter of sliding the two cleaning tablets into the purple holder, which allows the water that fills the bowl to pass over them and dissolve them over time. The tablets are rather crumbly and the packet they come in is difficult to open without a scissors. Flushing happens normally, no detectable difference. So far, after a few days, the bowl seems clean with no obvious buildup, I will update as the month goes on.The instructions are a bit tiny, and don't offer much detail for those who might not be familiar with the inside of their toilet. Luckily, was passingly familiar with how everything worked. There is an installation video on youtube if you need help.All in all, I think the tablet holder device should have been smaller, a different color, and easier to slide the tablets into.

"At first glance, this SoyJoy bar is weird. It's a little cube-shaped sort of twig, unlike a traditional bar shape. As such, you will probably think it can't be terribly satisfying. But actually, it does a pretty good job of filling you up for a while. I have found that one bar can tide me over for maybe two hours, if I am hungry, in advance of a meal.Taste-wise, the bars are sweet. Included among the ingredients are sugar, raisins, blueberries, pineapple, and coconut. The bars rate 140 calories, which is rather high given their weight (1.05 oz.), but the ingredients are all pretty wholesome, so I don't worry too much about it (interestingly, eggs, milk and butter are among the ingredients as well, despite a notable lack of artificial preservatives).I find myself wishing for a nut to be included, like walnuts perhaps. The included fruits do have a bit of interesting texture after you finish eating it (I can feel some coconut and raisin in my teeth after just having finished one), but I want a bit more of a crunchy note.I think this would be a very nice addition to a school lunch, or a workout bag. It provides somewhat lasting satiety, and isn't loaded with all sorts of bad stuff. It should be noted that these bars are rather expensive, as well, at over a dollar per.

"This unit does what it advertises - sends an audio signal to Bluetooth headphones without a noticeable lag. As far as ease of use and functions go, this has it all in order. The top button includes a blue-red LED light that lets you know whether it is trying to pair. Included is a magnetic ""hook"" with some 2 sided tape on one side, which gives the user an option for mounting. The unit charges via an included USB cable.My problem is this: since this unit is basically replacing the function of a Bluetooth transmitter, its utility is primarily for devices that lack such a transmitter. But there is only one kind of input into the device for audio - a 3.5mm stereo mini jack. This takes all sorts of devices that would be really nice to stream to Bluetooth headphones out of the running. I have an A/V receiver and a Blu-Ray player that I'd LOVE to send wireless audio from, but can't, because these devices either lack a 3.5mm mini jack entirely, or only have one as an input. Essentially, if your device doesn't have a stereo mini jack output, you're kind of out of luck (the manufacturer did include an RCA wire to mini jack adapter cable, but this is a legacy cable without a whole lot of application, since again, you would need a device with RCA wire output, not input).Without HDMI or Optical Digital input, the utility is this device is sorely limited for me.

"On the plus side, this unit is big, which allows you to place 6 bottles and other pump accessories onto one of two interior shelves. The unit is easy to put together. The top shelf is semi-adjustable, but to make it higher than the preset notch, you'd need to rest it atop the bottom items.On the minus side, the cord is short (~3 feet), which makes placement difficult. You have to disassemble the interior of the unit to pour water in, which is kind of a pain. There is nowhere on the unit to store the water fill cup when not in use. The user is supposed to supposed to wash items with soap and water first, so ""sanitizing"" doesn't replace washing, though this is pretty standard. It does raise the question of just what is being sterilized after washing with soap and water.  The biggest flaw however is that there is nowhere to hook the lid after opening, so a person needs to put the dripping wet, dome-shaped lid down on counter to unload the unit. It is awkward and inconvenient. Oddly, a cycle take 6 minutes if full, but a lighter load takes longer.As far as cleaning goes, the measuring cup to pour water has a mesh strainer that may catch some mineral deposits in tap water, and the instructions suggest using filtered/distilled water. You clean unit by using vinegar, with a suggested frequency of once weekly.The bottom line is that if you need a sanitizer for one of various reasons, this does a decent job, but it has irritating caveats that will require you to make extra space and go through extra steps to get the job done.

"***Content***I won't spend a lot of time discussing content. These are Hitchcock's US films that are currently held by Universal Studios. Is it a complete catalog of Hitchcock's classics? No. Missing are ""The Wrong Man,"" ""Notorious,"" ""Dial M For Murder,"" and ""Strangers on a Train,"" among others. But this set does contain his very best: Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds, Rear Window, North By Northwest (under license from WB), Rope, Shadow of a Doubt, etc.The question, content-wise, is whether you would be justified purchasing this set when the much cheaper ""Essentials"" collection contains the first five of the very best films listed above. I think the answer depends on what sort of fan you are. If you want the cream of the crop and aren't particularly interested in diving in to his lesser-known catalog and watching his evolution as a film-maker both before and after that peak period, then save yourself seventy bucks and pick up the ""Essentials"" set. They're exactly the same discs, albeit with cheaper packaging. But if you really want to learn about movies, and be entertained, and watch a prolific director change with the times, this set still provides a lot of value for the dollar. Fifteen movies at an average of seven or eight dollars apiece is a pretty healthy bargain.Extras are copious on the ""greats"" and bit less so on the catalog pieces. Almost all of them are ported over from prior DVDs, and so are low-res letterboxed/pillarboxed presentations. Sigh.***Packaging***The set is contained in a relatively sturdy box, and includes a nice softcover book of about 60 pages that shows movie posters, production drawings, and contains some info about each movie. The binder containing the discs is a bit more problematic. Each disc gets its own page in the binder, with graphics similar to the packed in book. But the sleeves are quite flimsy. Where, say, the Star Wars set or the Alien Anthology set were made of thick foam boards that housed each disc, these are very thin paperboard sleeves. Several of my sleeves have already started to let discs slip through the bottom where the glue should be stronger, as opposed to holding the discs securely inside. So although the box, book, and binder are all quite handsome from a graphical standpoint, the binder ends up coming off cheap.***A/V Quality***These video transfers are a real mixed bag. A few of them rank up with the best blu-ray discs from similar periods: Vertigo, North By Northwest, and The Trouble With Harry each offer superb detail, rich color, and a very film like experience. Others like Rear Window and Rope are pretty good, but suffer from strange digital noise owing to the way these prints were processed. Some, though, are absolutely wretched. Family Plot and Frenzy are edge-enhanced messes crawling with strange digital noise but also smoothed to heck with DNR. The Man Who Knew Too Much offers up totally bizarre colors, with several actors looking gray and ashen.Audio is mostly excellent. When soundtracks have been ""upgraded"" to 5.1 channel, they sound respectful and accurate. When we have stereo or mono tracks, dialogue is clear and no undue noise seems evident.***Conclusion***This is a great set, and will be thoroughly enjoyed by Hitchcock fans and fans of great cinema. But it has some serious flaws. The packaging stinks and fully a third of the movies look terrible by the standards set by other Blu-Ray transfers of movies from the 30s through the 70s.

"On the plus side, the cars are neat, and they are reminiscent (probably intentionally) of the Pixar car characters, which ought to please the toddler set. Our son enjoyed playing with them and racing them down the ramps. There are a lot of pieces, giving the builder flexibility in creating stands for the ramps, or even bridges, since there are four of the ramp connector pieces included.There are a few flaws with this set, though.First of all, don't let the box fool you, there is no container for these pieces. So you're on your own when you want to put it away. Secondly, I'm not a big fan of including stickers. It's clearly just a cost saving strategy by the company. Have you ever tried to apply tiny little stickers to blocks in the presence of a 3 year-old? Thirdly, the instructions follow a really weird convention in which the prior steps' blocks are grayed out, presumably to make things easier to follow, but in fact making it difficult to see where the current step's blocks go. Also, the instructions are small photographs taken from a strange angle, and would be somewhat difficult to follow even without the odd color scheme. The suggested configuration of blocks isn't terribly stable, using small ""one dot"" blocks next to each other as supports, which is never very sturdy.So all in all, I give this set 3 stars, meaning an ""OK,"" average, middle of the road toy. A box and better instructions would have made it a 4. Better customized pieces with paint instead of stickers would have made it a 5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214TU34HRLC0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J05N3MS#wasThisHelpful","R214TU34HRLC0U","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kobi Straight Tip Candle LED is an E12 ""Candelabra"" base bulb with a tall tip. AS far as build quality goes, this seems nice enough, though the top point has a slightly rough edge instead of a smooth taper (only really noticeable on the finger, not by sight). Heat generation is present but negligible compared to CFL and incandescent candelabra bulbs. The bulb is dimmable to about 10% brightness, which is typical for most current generation LEDs.Using a Kill-A-Watt meter, this bulb measured in at 5.9 watts used with a power factor of 82. This means that you are getting 77 lumens per watt, a good solid number considering this current generation of LED bulbs.Where this bulb really shines (so to speak) is in light dispersal. The dispersal is really even and wide, much better than the Lighting Ever LEDs I currently have in my ceiling fan. It's really best of breed from what I've seen of LED candelabra bulbs.Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MS9IDOXASMLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9WRUNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2MS9IDOXASMLX","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am replacing a Nalgene Tritan OTG BPA free bottle, which had a fragile cap (it broke within a year or so of light use). My typical use case for a water bottle is while teaching, needing water for wetting my whistle so that I can keep speaking. So I want to replicate the function of the Nalgene (easy one handed drinking, no noise, not too large) and still have a dishwasher safe bottle that won't break.I am already more confident in the durability of this bottle. There is no hinge, which was the failure point of the Nalgene's cap. The Contigo has a very sturdy screw top that seems immune to the kind of breakage that dropping or jostling the bottle might create. There is a spring mechanism with the spout seal, but it is entirely contained inside the cap, so I think it will last long term.As far as drinking goes, the Contigo makes no sucking noise (as some straw based bottles like Camelbak do). When the button is depressed, water flows through by gravity, requiring no extra effort by the drinker.This may not be the ideal exercise bottle because of the need for a button press, and because of the relatively small spout width. But for what I need: secure, durable water conveyance in a conversational setting, it really fits the bill.UPDATEI have had one spill in a bag. Perhaps I got overconfident as to the water-containing abilities of the bottle. But at least one of the measures (cap, switch to prevent button from depressing) failed, which resulted in water leaking on some other things in my bag. I should add, this was simply a bag on my passenger seat, so it wasn't being jostled. Accordingly, I've docked a star. Still a good bottle, but not ironclad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEIESO7L6BUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVODHO4#wasThisHelpful","R3HEIESO7L6BUC","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All questions about cloth vs. disposable aside, these are some pretty nice diapers.1. They absorb and hold a LOT of moisture. They do a good job of wicking it away from the skin, too, which helps prevent rashes.2. The ""velcro"" attachments are really excellent. The double-locking sort of velcro strips do a great job of adhering, but allow for easy re-adjustment, too. We've used diapers that didn't stick nearly as well.3. The leg-line does a good job of containing any accidents. We've had no leaks in a downward direction.So look. These diapers will do a good job of keeping your kids and your house/clothes dry.

"1. These pans do a good job of distributing heat to give a nice, even cook. I fried and scrambled eggs, made grilled cheese sandwiches, and made hamburgers/veggie patties in them.2. These pans are really heavy. This is a plus and minus. On the plus side, I used these pans in tandem as sort of a panini/grilled cheese press. They're that heavy. On the minus of course is the increased difficulty in maneuvering the pans.3. The non-stick coating works great but is EXTREMELY fragile. I took a grilled cheese sandwich off of the pan with a metal spatula once, and gingerly at that, and still saw scratches in the coating. This was pretty disappointing compared to the T-Fal pan we also have.So, all in all, I can't really recommend these pans for everyday kitchen use. They cook well but the coating is too temperamental to be relied upon long term. Go with one of T-Fal's pans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSUPWRP73NUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFTRUOQ#wasThisHelpful","ROSUPWRP73NUW","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been living with these bulbs for a few weeks. I initially bought them for a bathroom mirror fixture, but liked the light (and the price) enough to purchase more of them for floor and table lamps. Here are my observations:1. These bulbs draw 7.2 watts of electricity, not 8. I measured several of them with my Kill-A-Watt meter, and they all came in under the advertised 8 watts.2. There is indeed a short delay when turning them on. I'd say a quarter second. Since I am used to the CFLs these replace, this is no big deal for me.3. These are of course in the decorative size, so they are wider than a standard bulb. Keep this in mind when you plan to replace bulbs - I like the wide globe for ""Decorative"" lights, i.e. lights that one might see at any given time (in a lamp, ceiling fan, or sconce). These might not fit in some ceiling fixtures - it depends on how close the shade is to the socket.4. The base of these bulbs gets hot, but not terribly so compared to other CFL or LED bulbs.5. The dimming function works, but is not great. They don't get terribly dim on the low end, cutting out at perhaps 20% of the dimmer range. Almost every other LED bulb I have goes lower than this one.6. The color temperature is cooler than an old incandescent. but it is by no means blue. It is a really pure white, very close to sunlight.All in all, for under five bones a pop, this is a great buy. Hopefully they last as long as the rated life. If they do, I'll definitely enjoy these lights for a long time. I give them 4 stars for the turn-on delay and for the lackluster dimming performance. But overall I'm very enthused.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZE8MF50OKKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EK6L446#wasThisHelpful","R1ZE8MF50OKKQ","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Content: Certain episodes are triumphs of presentation (particularly the leaded gas and global warming episodes). Others are a bit scattershot and frustrate by jumping around between subjects too quickly. Overall, a very entertaining show that provides a wide survey of current science, the scientific method, and science history. This doesn't go as deep as some documentary shows (such as Brian Greene's Nova specials or Neil Shubin's PBS shows on evolution), but it is a good show for whetting the scientific appetite.The Blu-Ray: Video and audio quality are generally excellent, with loads of fine detail. Black levels do fluctuate a bit, but colors are always vibrant. Outdoor HD shots are typically better than space footage, which shows the most variability in quality.The extras are rather lackluster. Only one episode receives a commentary. The lone making of documentary is pretty good, if a bit self-congratulatory. The interactive cosmic calendar is a waste of time and effort - too cumbersome to enjoy using, not enough content within it. I really would have liked to see deleted scenes, or perhaps additional spotlight documentaries on certain topics.In sum, this is a good buy to get a layperson interested in science. It will entertain but probably not completely satisfy someone who has already delved into the topic matter in other formats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDXR4ZZUJ6I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWULSTC#wasThisHelpful","R2EDXR4ZZUJ6I0","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an MDF picture frame with a faux wood finish.

"The topic of stock and bond manipulation might sound dry, but really it isn't. It's the topic of a new nonfiction piece, ""Flash Boys,"" by ""Moneyball"" writer Michael Lewis. So the question here is whether this treatment of the topic is a bland, paint-by-numbers thriller in the vein of Dan Brown, or is something more interesting. The answer is sort of in between. Character names have a penchant for sounding like Hollywood scripts (""Garret Reilly"" is the protagonist), and the style veers a bit florid at times (""Then Blackness Overtook Avery Bernstein."").Overall, this was competent and mostly engaging.

"Robert Stone has written what might be called an ""arty"" tale of an unexpected death, but he does so admirably free of overly florid descriptions or unbearably twee trickery. Instead, he creates an interesting set of characters surrounding his central victim, Maud. The character description is reminiscent of Richard Russo, though perhaps not quite as adept. The backdrop is a New York college, with the various types of people you might find there, young and old. Maud herself is a student, who gets involved romantically with a professor. Overall this was a very quick read and was entertaining and interesting, throughout. I did not really like the title, it indicated more of a murder mystery (e.g. all the other ""Girl with the Insert XYZ"" type cash-ins), when really this was more of a story about all the surrounding and contributing aspects of her death and the effects it has on the other characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QDPRYMO0Z80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618386238#wasThisHelpful","R17QDPRYMO0Z80","A3JZ5L52FM318H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JZ5L52FM318H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I jumped on this at the cheap refurb price, with the hope that it would equal my current amplified Terk antenna. Not only did it equal the Terk, but it bested it.The Terk had to be constantly adjusted to pick up signals from various locations (I am on the South Side of Chicago, within the city limits, a few blocks from the lake, about 7-10 miles from most broadcast antennas downtown). The Mohu seems to be much better at ""omnidirectional"" reception, since I have not had to move it from its optimal position. The signal strength across all channels seems equal or up to 10% better than the Terk. Problematic VHF channels come in at 50% and above, and almost everything comes in at 70-plus. CBS, which is really difficult to pull in in Chicago (don't get me started) comes in stably at 30%.Basically, it equals or betters the performance of the Terk without a wall-wart power source and without sticking out on our mantel. It's a slam dunk upgrade. Your mileage may vary, of course. All I can vouch for is its performance in a large urban area. It has freed me from constantly adjusting my very conspicuous amplified antenna.

"I picked these for my elementary age kids to wrap up for me for my birthday. I wanted something I could wear all the time, since of course they love when I wear/use their gifts. What I really love about these is that the ""MOM"" is easy to read if you know what it says, but can pass as just a pretty scrollwork detail.

"This is a large and beautiful play set. It really is so pretty without being little girl looking. It's wonderful for my kindergartener but will also last and look current for years to come. I could even see this in a teenager's room, as long as she was really into fairies.It's heavier than I expected and is made of some kind of plastic (vinyl?) which feels both thicker and less brittle than my daughter's Disney castle. The base of the main piece measures 12 x 14 inches and if you arrange the two side pieces as shown on the box the whole set is close to two feet across. Putting the whole thing together took less than a half an hour. No tools are required. The structural elements snap firmly (and somewhat loudly) together, while the pieces you might want to move or change around join together well but can be moved without fear of breaking plastic connecters. The little decorative roses and squiggles were easy for my kindergartener to put wherever she liked without my help.The light up flower on the top is easy to work, very pretty, and comes with batteries already installed with one of those little plastic tabs you remove so the battery doesn't get used up during shipping. Speaking of shipping, each piece is properly bubble wrapped and snugly placed inside the box so I wouldn't think you would get any damage in the mail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207IA1IQ03F5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP6W47Q#wasThisHelpful","R207IA1IQ03F5C","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good Sonicare, and an excellent choice if you are purchasing to be shared by spouses with different dental goals and concerns. The base has little pegs to hold two brush heads so you can alternate for yourself or have one for each partner. What I find strange is the addition of the pressure sensor to a Sonicare that is designed for more aggressive cleaning and whitening than those of us with sensitive teeth and eroded gums can handle. The included brush heads are not good for my eroded gums either, I much prefer the ""Diamond Clean"" brush heads. You should know though that all the brush heads are compatible with the different (recent model) Sonicare bases. I put the diamond heads on this brush to give it a thorough testing.The pressure sensor is a neat feature and I can trigger it by pushing harder than normal, but not enough to hurt (which would make it a useless feature). If you are continuing to erode your gums even with another Sonicare the price of this toothbrush is a small one compared with gum reconstruction surgery. This is a nice toothbrush and perfect for my husband, but I won't replace my own Sonicare Healthy White with it when the time comes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0QU9QNCLYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","R2H0QU9QNCLYF","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The interlocking pieces are well designed so they are easy to put together and don't fall apart when you need to move the toy around.

The rubberized blocks are manageable to put into place, but don't fall apart randomly. My 3rd grader isn't thrilled that they stick into their spots too securely for the Terraria dude to knock them out with this sword, but it's better than having them fall out and get immediately eaten by the dog.As a single purpose Terraria playset I would probably give this three stars, just because there's not that much you can actually DO with it. However,when my son was younger I really wanted to find him a generic structure he could use to play with all his various figures. This would have been great for that too!

"I bought this to read to my kids at bedtime. The premise of the book seems very cool at first (the idea of physically going into a book, and existing there and being able to interact with your environment and even characters) but the explanations of how this happens are extremely weak. Yes, I know, it's fantasy. But good fantasy should give you something to wonder about, this just doesn't. I also found it extremely annoying that the Kiel Gnomenfoot books were presented as being hokey and Harry Potter ripoffs, and then proceeded to become the focus of the whole book. I agree with the author, his book is hokey. It's like it was poorly written on purpose to show how poorly written some kids' books are.

"This is a great solar charging kit that comes with everything you need. For our family this is going to be an occasional use tool, brought on the occasional camping trip and providing me peace of mind in case of prolonged power outage.Things I really like:Everything looks top notch and well made and finished. Even the box isn't a tear open and throw away package, it's a sturdy container with molded places for each piece.The attachments don't just clip in (which I think would produce wear and tear after a while) but you clip them in and then screw a threaded piece around the attachment point to secure it.The solar panel itself has three attachments so you can directly charge items.You can chain the portable battery between your device and the solar panel so you can charge both at the same time.The kit includes a short, fabric covered cable which connects my Samsung phone to the portable battery. Now I don't have to take apart my wall charger to bring the cable with me.

"I use spray in my hair for two main reasons: When it's dry to smooth it down and add some semblance of style, or when it's wet to help hold my natural curls together. Spraying this on my dry hair has been a disaster every time I've tried it. It makes my hair feel sticky and really unappealing, and it looks worse. However, putting it on my wet hair is GREAT! I have natural curls that tend to fall apart into fluffy layers if I look at them cross-eyed but I don't always have time (or the desire) to do the whole gel-scrunch-diffuse dry-hairspray routine.

"My husband and I have been using these with our new Keurig 2.0 K250 for about a week and they have worked flawlessly. I love that they can go in the top rack of my dishwasher, and since there are three I am never without a clean one. To use just fill it up to the top of the dolphins (maybe 1/4 inch below the lid) with coffee grounds and place it in your Keurig with the hinge exactly at the top. When you close the lid the piercing needle will go into the groove at the bottom of the cup without damaging it. When I close the lid the Keurig acts exactly like it does with the licensed K-cups I bought at Costco.I choose a 10 oz cup and use the ""strong"" setting and the cup of coffe tastes just like when I run the same coffee grounds through my drip maker.

"Our first experience with Keurig was the K45 I bought my husband several years ago, and I hated it. The coffee was weak and the machine broke and had to be replaced. Twice. This little Keurig is such a HUGE IMPROVEMENT. I have cleaned and put away our regular drip maker, hopefully for good.What I like about Keurig in general is the lack of dishes to wash. I am a stay at home mom during the day but I work at night, usually until midnight. I'm not really in the mood to wash my coffee carafe and filter basket at 12:20am, and even less so when I crawl out of bed with the kids at 7:00.What I like about this particular Keurig is the ""strong"" setting. It makes a great cup of coffee, tastes just like drip, with the reusable K cup filled with the coffee of my choice. It's almost too strong, like the coffee at Starbucks, when I use the strong setting with the Peet's Alma De La Tierra organic dark roast K cups I bought at Costco.I think the whole proprietary K cups thing is pretty lame and I don't have the time or interest to sit around hacking stuff. I also prefer to use my own coffee to save money, keep plastic out of the landfill, and improve the variety of coffee available for me to use.

"I am so disappointed in this book, and for a long time I was so excited about it. I love mysteries and was thrilled at a smart mystery series for kids. The two main characters show the same kind of smarts, mild disobedience and lawbreaking in their efforts to solve crime that you find in a lot of detective novels for adults. In fact, the plot has less holes and is better thought out than some mysteries I have had the displeasure to read.Unfortunately, right when the plot starts picking up speed and rolling towards the end the author resorts to the kind of cheap attention getting tricks that keep me sticking to older books for my kids as much as possible. In this case the gag of choice (get it?) is vomit. Why do so many books aimed at upper elementary aged boys have to be centered on farts, boogers and the like? My son loves farts as much as anyone, maybe more, but we don't need this. This is a really good series, but I can't help feeling like my kid's intelligence is being discounted by this plot device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WV92FT8DZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544302060#wasThisHelpful","R33WV92FT8DZB","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Home to Chicory Lane is the first Deborah Raney novel I have read. I definitely liked the book, but it took until the second half for me to get into it. The first half seems very distant, and because I was getting the hear the characters' doubts and fears without having gotten to know them yet I really didn't like any of them very much. Also some of the details seemed wrong to me. The young couple in the book have moved from an apartment on the upper west side of Manhattan to a studio in Bedford Stuyvesant and keep talking about how much more expensive it is. I'm not an expert on New York but a quick internet search confirmed what I thought, that a two bedroom in the upper west side will run you between $4000 and $8000 a month, and a studio in Bed-Stuy is under $2000. I know this seems like nit-picking, but this move and the resulting financial hardship is a huge part of the plot.The second half of the book is much better. The plot picks up speed from angst and whining to decisions and action, and you finally start to see inside the hearts of the characters. Everyone's relationship with God also goes from being randomly inserted to a real part of who they are. By the end of the book I was enjoying their company and feeling good about the decisions they had made. There's not too much substance here, but still an enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FI30USCHTCSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426769695#wasThisHelpful","R1FI30USCHTCSJ","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.  I had really high hopes for it as the functionality that is listed in the description really makes it sound like a great point and shoot camera.  I have experience with lots of different digital cameras, from the more sophisticated D-SLR cameras to the simplest disposables.  So I was really let down with this one.First off, for the casual user who just wants a simple point and shoot camera, I would not recommend this.  Panasonic did a horrible job of making the basic camera functions as complex as possible, requiring several steps to making adjustments that other cameras innately have available with one click or turn of a dial.  However, even if this wasn't an issue, which after a few days of use it became a little easier to remember where certain features were located, the biggest problem that I have with this camera overall is the horrible delay between pressing the shutter release button and time it takes the camera to snap the photograph.  This drove me crazy on my old freebie smart phone, so when this decently priced camera did it I was really shocked.  Basically what happens is you go to take a picture of say your children, so you line them up, tell them to smile, and push the button, you can almost count to two before the camera takes the picture.  At this point everyone has moved and the picture comes out all wrong or blurry.  It's really a shame.  I even switched the setting over to ""action"" so that it would increase the shutter speed time, and the results were exactly the same.  So if you tried to use the ""action"" mode to catch a thrilling shot at a sporting event or something, the picture would be about two seconds later than the one you tried to take!  At that timing, what's the point?I tried playing with the ""WINK"" setting for taking selfies, and that also needs some more engineering from Panasonic.  It works, but barely.  After setting the camera to take a picture using a ""wink"" (in the same menu as the countdown mode) you have to really be patient with it, and stand there looking like a crazy person winking slowly at your camera in an over emphasized manner in order for the camera to start a 3 second countdown to take the picture.  Even then, I could only get it to take a picture once every ten or so attempts.  Or you could just set the camera to countdown mode, press the shutter button, and the 3 second countdown happens exactly the same way.For more experienced photographers, Panasonic didn't help you out either.  The manual settings for adjusting aperture and shutter speed require four different steps, toggling between menu functions in order to make your adjustments.  It really shouldn't be that difficult to do these kind of changes, and really wastes a lot of good opportunities by forcing you to do them.There are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYCSFTDYMJCXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBG68Q6#wasThisHelpful","RYCSFTDYMJCXV","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simple to install and holds the 23"" flat screen LED television securely.  The fact the two vertical bars that connect the TV to the mount are free sliding, it will fit on pretty much any TV or monitor that I can think of.  You can choose which hole combination fits best, secure them to your TV, then simply hang the TV onto the mount's base that you already secured to the wall.However, I have a Panasonic and the bolts that come with the mount for securing it to the TV did not work at all, so I had to use some different ones that I happen to have lying around the house.So be sure that if you have a Panasonic TV, to make sure that you have mounting bolts that fit before purchasing this mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FH6N7RCQEPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RB7ATC#wasThisHelpful","R18FH6N7RCQEPS","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love the functionality of seamless control going from the automatic focus to the manual focus by simply half pressing the shutter button and then rotating the focus ring.  I can easily get the camera to get a solid focus and then manually bump it in either direction, thus giving me so much more control over the final composition of my shots.Because it is a prime lens, you must be willing to move your body around a bit more in order to crop in and out of your desired shot, but for me the control that it gives and the quality of the final photo is worth any hassle I had to go through to frame the shot.This should be a lens in every DSLR user's bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPC6I7MGQMY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001S2PPT0#wasThisHelpful","R2CPC6I7MGQMY3","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a fantastic game!  My 7 year old son has really started to conceptualize strategy, so we figured that this would be a fun way to build on his growing enthusiasm.  After learning the basics of checkers, he was ready to try out this version.  Basically this is a turn based game where the roll of the dice determines what pieces of which colors a player gets to move.  Each player has a designated color, but you get to move not only your pieces but the other players pieces as well.  The fun ""dog"" twist is that the checker pieces are small dog bowls, and when a King is made, you just add a small bone into the bowl to represent the pieces promotion.So a big part of the game is to strategize about moving your opponents pieces as well as your own to optimize your chances to win.  It's a great spin on traditional checkers and really gets you thinking about how different moves can effect the game.  Even I am building a lot deeper understanding of checker strategy by playing it.I would highly recommend this game for anyone old enough to understand the basic game of checkers because even the most skilled player can be challenged by having their opponent manipulate their pieces, thus constantly changing the game.  Lots of fun for everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NX7JEZ6JL9PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1XA768#wasThisHelpful","R3NX7JEZ6JL9PV","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Some love it, but I can't stand it, so I was very pleased that this washes off cleanly without the feeling that I just put lotion on my skin.  The wash forms a great lather and for those that remember the 80's, it definitely works to make you feel, ""clean as a whistle""!The scent is pleasing, with a clear hint of mint.

"I was fascinated by the concept of this food so I just had to try it. It passes every criterion set by dog food advisor, no weird mystery ""meat"" or grain fillers. The label does indeed say ""complete and balanced"". My bulldog will eat anything including gravel so I knew it would be no trouble to get it into him. We do travel with him and I thought it might be nice to bring this little box rather than a big, smelly tub of kibbles.Mixing it up is easy, although like other reviewers I found that less water than suggested was better if your dog doesn't like soup. I was shocked at how not messy his face was after he ate it. When I occasionally give him baby food with his kibbles I think half of it ends up spread between his eyes and neck.

"This is a pretty good parenting book on how to recognize and nurture your child's spiritual connection with a power (whichever one you feel connected to) larger than themselves. The author discusses the difference between her definition of spirituality and adherence to an organized religion. She is open to having a spiritual life outside a church, but is never disrespectful to those of us whose spiritual life is centered in our church community, which I thought was nice.My educational background is in science, I have a couple of degrees in hard sciences. I am also a spiritual person whose faith is totally grounded in my church. I have never had a problem reconciling these two things, they are both who I am. I found the ""science"" aspect of this book a bit forced. It seems to be aimed at parents who are uncomfortable with religion, especially sharing religion with their kids.

I was so embarrassed at the way she looked I had to explain it to her teacher so she wouldn't think my kid had wet hair all day.

He still gets eczema patches on his knees, and has very dry elbows, chapped lips and skin around his mouth.

"This little set has two awesome parts:1.

We have a couple of the mini monster truck sets and a couple sets for the full sized trucks. I think this one is my favorite so far.

"I don't know much about morning sickness, as I was stricken with full blown hyperemesis with both pregnancies. What I do know about is the desperate struggle to get adequate nutrients to your baby when you can't keep much of anything down, so I thought this powdered pre-natal was a good idea and worth trying. Unfortunately it is yucky. I'm not even currently pregnant and I couldn't force it down. I think the problem is that they insisted on including iron, a substance which makes even pills leave a gross aftertaste. Sure iron is great to have when you're pregnant, but it's not critical like some other nutrients like folic acid. Speaking of folic acid, which you absolutely have to have to help prevent spinal defects, if you find you can't keep any pre-natal vitamins down you can take folic acid by itself.

"This book is less of an in depth discussion of topics and more like a collection of magazine articles. This is less surprising when you learn that the author has appeared on the Today show 25 times, and is trying to develop this book into a TV series. Dr. Holland offers you some pseudo-science such that the reason parents of young children who have been married for several years no longer have so much sex is based on a combination of changes in hormones and the ""fact"" that humans are not meant to be monogamous. The book is long on explanations but short on suggestions, unless you think that cheating or having an open marriage are ""solutions"" worthy of your consideration.There are chapters on getting more sleep, eating better, getting exercise; not exactly ground breaking aids to your mental and physical health. The author is also extremely passionate about marijuana, which she insists we call cannabis, because the name marijuana was made up by the Federal government to scare us because we all hate and fear the people of Mexico(?!?).

"This is a well written book that earns a place on the bookshelf of anyone getting started as a caregiver. The key here, is the ""getting started"" part. It is an excellent resource for people with aging, but still functional parents. It gives comprehensive guides and checklists (with space for notes) on financial, medical, and legal conversations to have. However, this is more of a narrative than the kind of reference book you look stuff up in. It is also quite specific to the type of caregiving journey the author had with her father: long distance care, followed by care in her own home, followed by care at a facility. The chapter on deciding whether you should have your aging parent in your own home was inadequate unless you had an ideal childhood, are financially well off, and are willing to do anything for your parent. Those of us with abusive parents end up as their caretakers too, and are less likely to be willing to provide care at home.All this being said I think this is a valuable book if you are at the start of your caregiving journey and I would recommend it to anyone in that situation. You would be best served by combining it with a more detailed resource that will actually answer your specific questions, such as Long-Term Care: How to Plan & Pay for It.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TIQXO8O4766/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373893094#wasThisHelpful","R12TIQXO8O4766","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since Graco is marketing the Argos as a 3-in-1, I have to review this seat in three parts: as a forward facing harness seat for toddlers and preschoolers, as a high-back booster, and then as a backless booster.Five point harness seat: FIVE STARSHigh back booster: THREE STARSBackless booster: ONE STARAs a five point harness seat for toddlers and preschoolers the Argos Elite, like the Nautilus before it, is a five star seat. I love absolutely everything about it. It is comfortable, sturdy, easy to install, easy to adjust the harness tightness, has lots of pockets for goodies, easy to wash. This seat has it ALL. With the Nautilus you had to un-latch the seat and re-thread the top of the straps as your child grows, but with the Argos you can adjust the headrest up and down without removing the top of the harness.As a high-back booster there are two flaws. The first is that the seat is so huge that your child will absolutely not be able to buckle themselves. You will be able to clearly see the female end of the seatbelt, but it is difficult even for an adult to get the male end of the buckle around and behind the armrest to click it shut. The second problem is that while it's obviously great to be able to raise the headrest you can't adjust the width of the seat at the shoulders. My 4 year old's shoulders don't fit comfortably between the sides and letting my 7 year old try the seat was a joke. He is probably the skinniest 7 year old on earth, less than 45 lbs, and there is no way he could ride in that seat with the back on. If you need a high back booster for an older kids I use this one: Diono Monterey High Back Booster with Adjustable Headrest, SurfAs a backless booster honestly this seat is a joke. While it is theoretically possible to use the Argos this way I can't imagine anyone ever would. First off it looks ridiculous without the back, big old plastic hinges sticking out the back. Second it is way too high. If your kid is so short that they could tolerate being boosted up this much they need a different seat. And they still won't be able to buckle it themselves.Graco is doing themselves (and their customers!) a disservice advertising this as a three in one seat. The honest answer is this is a seat that will safely and comfortably harness your kid up through preschool. It's a great seat for that and worth every penny! If you need that kind of seat you will love this one. Just don't fool yourself that it will be the only seat you ever need.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R399JCLQ0696JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTL45QA#wasThisHelpful","R399JCLQ0696JO","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been regularly using a Crock Pot brand slow cooker for the last 10 years. I wanted to try this Hamilton Beach one because it promises no more overcooked mush, and it actually delivers on that promise. Our old Crock Pot is a nice one, programmable on high or low for up to twelve hours. The two things that have annoyed me about it over the years are that the crock has to be hand washed, and the low setting cooked our dinners in closer to the time recommendations in recipes for high power. After a long day cooking you really did get overcooked mush.The first thing I made in the Hamilton Beach was a potato cheese soup. I threw everything in, used the intelli-time feature, and headed out the door to work. When I returned home I expected my soup to be boiling vigorously like it always did in my old Crock Pot. Instead it was held at a very low simmer, enough to keep the soup piping hot and cook the potatoes, but not so much to dissolve the potatoes into mush. What a difference! I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A27B3IUEOQUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J8MKKS#wasThisHelpful","R1A27B3IUEOQUX","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful Panini press that does a great job providing a sandwich that is nice and hot all the way through the middle, achieving a crunchy outside, all while not burning or charring the bread.I picked up this Proctor Silex because I thought that it would have a smaller grilling area than my Griddler by Cuisinart.  The Griddler is intended to do different kinds of grilling So I assumed that an actual Panini Press would take up a little less counter/shelf space so I gave it a try.  At the very least I was able to really do a thorough side by side comparison between the two.As it turns out the Proctor Silex Panini Press is a little thinner but the overall grilling surface area is about the same size as the Griddler.  The Griddler reached full heat level about two minutes before this Panini Press, so they were both pretty much ready to cook at the same time.  I made four pesto turkey paninis (all exactly the same), two on each press, so as to test the cooking times.  The Griddler finished cooking the sandwiches about three minutes before the Proctor Silex, so it does appear that the heating elements in the Cuisinart does push a little more power to the grill plates than this press does.  A bit of a positive for this Panini press is that it has a locking mechanism on the arm so that you can press the sandwich down and lock it in place keeping it pressed down for cooking.  The Griddler does not have this feature.Both made exactly the same quality sandwiches, as my family couldn't tell the difference between the two sets.  So at least so far both performed pretty much as well as the other, with the Cuisinart Griddler having a little more power for faster start up and cooking time.It was in the cleanup that the Griddler really takes a break away lead from this Panini Press.  Once all the cooking is done and the presses have cooled off, this Proctor Silex Panini Press cleanup requires that you wipe it down with a soft cloth, using mild dish soap for especially soiled areas.  You cannot submerge the press for cleaning, but clean it just like a regular waffle iron.  So it is a bit tedious getting into all the cracks of the press to get it really clean.  The Cuisinart Griddler though as completely removable grill plates that can be dropped right into a sink of soapy water.  Easy to clean, then dry off.Overall, I like the Griddler a little better (5 Stars instead of 4) just because of the ease of cleanup, which holds a lot of weight to me, but I think that most people  would be completely happy with choosing this one over the other.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOIQYF4UA468/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNMIWTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NOIQYF4UA468","A4EBYIKOMYFF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4EBYIKOMYFF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading many reviews I think there is a strong concern this perfume is not the original one from Calvin Klein.  My bottle seems to be the real deal.  The packaging looked like other Calvin Klein perfume that I have had in the past.  The perfume was not discolored, and the scent seemed to be correct.  This is a small sized bottle that is perfect to carry in your purse.

"imagine the fun and the excitement of building a fun and entertaining life through random chance.  We all grew up playing ""Life"", but this game is so much quickly, and isn't a lot of fun.  So we tried this game tonight, and it wasn't a bit hit.  You get to build the best life you can with these cards.  After about 5 rounds of this game, we had gone through the whole deck.  You can swap out cards with others, or build the best life you can from the deck.  This game is a quick playing game that takes maybe 10 minutes per round.I feel with the number of people you need to play the game with, and the limited number of lifestyle cards, this game has very limited play.  Yes, you will get some chuckles when you find yourself a rock star living in a cardboard box in Nowhereville.  I don't think this would be a game you would be pulling out more than once or twice.

"I want to like this more.  My entire house is tile.  I hate to grab the whole mop bucket out, and sometimes pulling out the steamer doesn't make me feel like the floor is clean, because there isn't scrubbing action with the steamer.  I like the scrubbing action of this floor.  So this would be great if it was designed for smaller jobs.Each time you use this you need to pull out the filter and wash it and let it dry.  This is a lot of work for when you want a quick and easy cleaning job.  I have cats, there is nothing like finding a hairball that has dried to the floor.  They tend to only offer one at a time, so for me, this is a lot of work pulling this out, loading up a tank, and then washing the filter.What this is good for is if you want to do large rooms of tile.  So the water spray isn't perfect, you have to squeeze the handle, and you may have to go over it a couple of times.  The wheels could use a redesign.  You can work with them, they aren't agile, they are functional.

"I am seeing this brand more often in the stores.  So far I have been very impressed with the Japonesque brand.  They offer a higher end products that are on bar with well known names here such as Make Up Forever, Urban Decay, and MAC.  So this is something much nicer than you would normally get in a drug store.The packaging is a big plus, a very nicely decorated case that is study.  So you can feel like the product won't break or crack in the package should you put it in your purse to carry around.  I think this is a big plus.  I have the purple shade number 06.  I thought the colors were very nice, and very wearable for most for either the office or  evening.The texture is a soft and buttery and they blend very well.  I wasn't in love with the pigmentation.  I always wear eye shadow with a primer and these lasted from 6 am in the morning until 10 pm when I washed them off at night.  This compact really does a nice job at giving you a great day look.  If you want something more intense I think you may need to enhance it with additional colors.  While the quality and lasting power of this shadows is amazing, the pigmentation leaves something to be desired.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3LE4LRL4HE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR677QS#wasThisHelpful","R2G3LE4LRL4HE0","A1KXONFPU2XQ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KXONFPU2XQ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an amazing lotion!! I personally feel like I need to go to a meeting when it comes to how many different types of lotion I own.  I am always looking for the perfect one that will sooth my dry skin, and keep it protected.  I do a lot of dishes, work with my hands continually, so I wash them very often.  My skin is often dry.  I really want a lotion that will add a protective layer.This is a creamy lotion, it feels soft and silky.  You will feel like you are putting on a protective layer on your hand.  This lotion feels so amazing,  it reminds me of my L'Occitane Shea Butter lotion.  This is much more reasonably priced than higher end lines, but has a very similar feel.  It is heavier, and will give your hands a protective layer that will last for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182FY328SEQJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2MYTYS#wasThisHelpful","R182FY328SEQJ7","A1KXONFPU2XQ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KXONFPU2XQ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for a good solid coffee maker this may be the one for you.  Black and Decker has been making consumer products for many years.  We know and trust their brand name.  While they haven't been making coffee pots for that long, I think this is a great first effort.  I have this machine as well as a Cuisinart.  I will say the one thing this model has over the other for me, is the programming.  I don't like to read directions, and I generally hope that a product is designed well enough for me to use without a lot of reading.  I could figure out how to set the clock and get this model up and running.I loved the filter, in concept.  You won't have to buy disposable filters, but rather you can use the one that comes with the machine, but I have a hard time cleaning it.  Since the blade of the mill is so close to the filter, it is difficult to make sure you are getting it clean without the potential of scratching or cutting yourself.  I don't enjoy having to refill the filter every time I want to make coffee, as I feel the need to clean out the filter.I wished the coffee pot would have been a stainless steel pot instead of the more traditional glass coffee pot.  I don't like my coffee to cook continually, and a thermal pot would have been nice.Nice coffee pot in many areas.  I think there were some design improvements that hopefully will come out in the next model.  You may want to look at other options in this price point.  The coffee tastes great, and it is very easy to program, for me these are major pluses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369B48RKN4PDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HZFK#wasThisHelpful","R369B48RKN4PDH","A1KXONFPU2XQ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KXONFPU2XQ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been recently exploring this line of make up.  I have to say I am impressed.  This is a really nice shade of eye shadow.  It is perfect for a lid color, or a highlighter.  It is a nice fleshy color with a slight shimmer.  This goes on creamy and and doesn't flake off.  If you are wondering what these are comparable to I think they are like Urban Decay.  These are a high end and high quality eye shadow.The packing is pretty, a nice multi-colored case.

"PROS:Compact design6 Separate Ink CartridgesSimple InterfaceGood photo qualityCONS:Limited paper storagePricySome of the plastic is flimsyThere is no real simple inexpensive printer solution for both photos, and black and white copies.Out of the boxThe un-boxing is fairly easy.  I thought this printer wasn't intuitive in putting this together.  There is a lot of tape, and you have to be very careful about pulling the tape off.  There are no additional cables but if you are going for wi fi you should be fine.  The power cord is the only item this comes with.You will need to remove items from the printer to get the six printer cartridges into the printer.DesignThe printer is what I would call light weight, but if you are buying this for your home, this should be sufficient.  I like the fact of that there are multiple printer cartridges because you can replace only what you need.  The LCD panel is nice, and designed as well.SetupI thought this was a bit tough.  Lots of tape, and lots of things that need to be moved.  I couldn't use the CD because I have a Mac Book Pro and it doesn't have a CD player.  So I had to download my driver.  It attached easily to my wireless network.PrintingThis printer dose do double sided printing.  I don't think it works well because the ink bleeds.  I use regular office paper.  I imagine that thicker paper may work better.  Photo reproduction is good.  I will still use services like Costco, or Walgreens when I want to print out multiple copies.SummaryI think this is a good printer, it is pricy, I think HP has less expensive options.

"This book is a wonderful Make-Ahead cookbook.  What I have often found frustrating about these books, is typically they are crock-pot recipes only.  This book gives a lot of recipes for recipes that you can freeze.  This gives you a lot of flexibility in preparing food that you really can prepare ahead of time.One of the aspects that I really liked about this cookbook is that the recipes tend to be from scratch.  So often crock-pot recipes, and other recipes that you make ahead use a lot of items that are processed.  This cookbook has a lot of recipes that are from scratch.  This makes it in my opinion for more superior because the recipes are from real food ingredients.

If you are hoping this book to be filled with concepts of statistics, it isn't.

Not a lot of romance but a few twists and turns are found, I was completely and surprised and in awe of this complex tale.  What a great privilege and joy to read.

An experienced woman of seduction and a virgin of seduction find their HEA.Well written with a couple of Wolf Hounds, a dark, damp, secluded castle, a reclusive professor, a birthday present, a Courtesan, all added to the mix make an exciting, seductive read.

"A unique English Medieval  Historical  set during the twelve century. A tale of mystery, family feuds, betrayal,  angst,  an outlawed  Knight, an errant Knight, Kings, civil war and much tragedy.A bit confusing at times.

"This rather choppy mystery set in the Falkland Islands with a nebulous ending is a risky departure for the author from previous novels involving the intriguing character Lacey Flint of the London police department. It is interesting to learn something of the lay of the land of this series of very isolated islands sitting off the very southeastern part of Argentina. The islands are hilly, craggy, windblown, mostly treeless with bogs and peat and hard to traverse in other than four wheel drive vehicles. And then there is the omnipresent sea. It all seems quite ominous.The story begins in Nov, 1994 with an eclipse of the sun pending and lifelong resident Catrin Quinn plotting revenge against her former best friend Rachael, who accidentally caused her two young sons to die three years prior. To complicate matters three other young boys have gone missing in those three years. Harbored suspicions are not held back when Catrin and her British ex-soldier friend Callum, who suffers from PTSD blackouts, happen to find the third boy alive. But if possible, things get worse when Rachaelâs youngest son vanishes.Basically, Catrin, Rachael, and Callum are put in a position where they have to confront their demons from the past and the present and hopefully the mysteries and reasons surrounding the boysâ deaths and disappearances will fall out of that resolution. The book seems a bit overdrawn as far as the psychological distresses and the mysteries recede as a result. Maybe a return to Flint is needed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAQJGWM200DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250028590#wasThisHelpful","R1LAQJGWM200DL","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rather sappy story is concerned with Becky Lynn, who escapes from small-town Mississippi and a very abusive past as a teenager to success in the world of fashion photography and modeling in southern California. Becky Lynn is likeable, unpretentious, yet determined, all of which she needs to be to survive in fast-paced, anonymous CA.Luckily, her interest in VOGUE as a youngster pays off when the fledgling photographer son of her CA beauty shop employer recognizes her eye for the perfect picture. Her new job as a photographerâs assistant throws her into the dog-eat-dog world of fashion and into the midst of several personal rivalries. Of course, sexual intrigue is also part of that world and Becky Lynn, oddly attractive, has her pursuers. And, in fact, her unusual looks are finally recognized and she becomes a leading model. Quite a turnaround for âwhite trashâ from Mississippi.The book is a quick, easy read and the fortunes of Becky Lynn hold oneâs attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHETRWB6R5KWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778327167#wasThisHelpful","RHETRWB6R5KWS","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this book is a widespread look into the anti-aging scientific world, one might expect a chapter by chapter approach that leads to a prescription for prolonging oneâs life. If that is the expectation, disappointment will follow. The author is a journalist, who examines seemingly a miscellaneous number of ideas held by scientists concerning particulars of body chemistry that detract or add to longevity. And then there is the debate as to whether people really will continue to get much older in the future, or are there biological limits in play?A few centenarians are introduced, but their age seems to be mostly luck, not due to a magic formula. Several persons the author meets take massive amounts of hormones and other chemical supplements, but again there is little proof that they work and could be harmful. Once through the book, one is mostly left with the fact that a sensible, moderate life in terms of consumption and exercise is the best bet against dying prematurely or possibly extending oneâs life.The book is a bit tedious, as the author drags out each of his chapters introducing a particular scientist and his or her insight into aging. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see where the research is on aging despite a good bit of ambiguity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KU9E24143DNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455527440#wasThisHelpful","R2KU9E24143DNG","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The incandescently beautiful Dominika Egorova, a mole for the CIA in Russiaâs security service, the SVR, returns in this fast-paced spy novel where she must use all of her wits and spy craft acumen to stay ahead of those who are determined to uncover the certainty of a mole in their midst.  She had returned to Russia a year or so ago in a spy swap only to be severely interrogated, which she managed to survive. Now, fully restored, she is providing information to both her Russian bosses and her CIA handlers regarding a high-tech seismic floor for the Iranians to stabilize the production of weapons grade materials. She has to be extremely careful in her reconnection with her main CIA handler and lover Nate Nash and likewise not raise the ire of her jealous Russian boss, Col. Zyuganov, a holdover from the KGB days.The story is ramped up when a disgruntled top CIA official in Washington under code name TRITON begins supplying information to the Russians. Of course, Dominika, gaining more and more standing in the SVR, learns of TRITON. It really is just a matter of time before TRITON learns of Dominika and exposes her, unless she can get to him first. The story has a certain edginess to it as Dominika must use guile and violence to keep out of the Russian torture chambers. Interestingly enough, Dominika becomes a favorite of Vladimir Putin, which gives her needed cover. Given his characterization by the author, it is doubtful that Putin would be a huge fan of the book.As in RED SPARROW, the author includes a lot of the nuts-and-bolts of spying, which is not surprising given his CIA background. If anything, this sequel is a tighter more compelling read than the first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DN1VFASF62QQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476793743#wasThisHelpful","R1DN1VFASF62QQ","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author readily admits that his turning 70 and losing cycling capability are the motivators for this book. It is his claim, backed up by a good deal of evidence, that large declines in performance can be avoided with training and habits that counter physical changes in older athletes. Of the two essential elements of training, that is volume and intensity, it is intensity that must be emphasized to counter the effects of aging. And that is contrary to the advice often given that older athletes must take a long, slow approach to training.Of all the declines in athletes, it is the reduction of VO2-Max, the ability of an athlete to process oxygen that most severely limits performance. After describing that change and others common to aging athletes, for example gaining fat and losing muscle, the author introduces a rudimentary training plan to address those issues. Key to his plan is the inclusion of aerobic-capacity and lactate-threshold intervals of varying intensity and duration. In addition there are more conventional elements like longer aerobic threshold efforts and weightlifting. His plan is tailored for those in any endurance sport. Periodization of training is also discussed with the elements of training adjusted based on where one is in a racing cycle.The main point of the book, that is the emphasis on training intensity, is noteworthy. In so far as the author sticks to supporting and explaining that idea, the book is good. However, there is some redundancy and the inclusion of bits of miscellaneous testimony from older athletes does not add much. The author also veers into general health topics of the aged such as sleep, fat, insulin, and diet. The book is a corrective to the notion that people somehow have to substantially decline in old age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VENNCPHFG7IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937715264#wasThisHelpful","R1VENNCPHFG7IU","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The night lawyer is thirty-something Eleanor Porter, who at night screens the content of a London tabloid to keep them out of legal trouble. Ellie is supposed to be a sympathetic character who has pulled herself together after being hospitalized in a psychiatric ward after a traumatic breakup with her married lover Will. And she has other issues, namely, that of her father suddenly dying when she was eight for which she takes the blame.Yet, she has the determination to become a lawyer and steadily advance through a manâs world of karate. She shows no fear in traversing the transportation systems and streets of London when she leaves work late at night. But now she becomes more and more certain that she is being stalked by an older man, who seems vaguely familiar. And Will reenters the scene.This story simply does not resonate as it consists of endless trips back and back to work with Ellie obsessing about her issues past and present. One hardly knows how to take her. Is she a strong survivor or is she a weak sister?

"The ex-pat community of 1920s Paris is known for being a home to many literary giants of the 20th century, but this book is a grim, realistic look at how the other half lived. The British Marya, a sometimes chorus girl, has been living in Paris with her con-man, Polish husband for a while. But when his racket is discovered, he is sentenced to jail leaving Mayra to basically fend for herself with scarcely a franc to her name.Fortuitously, or not, she meets an English couple who invite her stay in a small room in their apartment. Her life consists of endless outings to cafes, seedy bars, restaurants, and great deal of drinking. More significantly, she is virtually forced to become entangled in their rather antagonistic psychological games. The wife encourages Marya to take up with her husband and then makes life uncomfortable when she does. Eventually her husbandâs release from prison has to be filtered into this distressing situation.The book is basically a brief and bleak look at the miserableness of dead-end lives and the vulnerability, especially of women, of those with no resources to get their heads above water. The end for such people usually is not good. The atmospherics of the book are unrelenting in capturing the entire situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32P558BB3IUPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060135379#wasThisHelpful","R32P558BB3IUPA","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel, considered to be a classic and set in the early 20th century, is a tragic story of two well-to-do couples, one American and the other English, who spend a good deal of time together in Europe just before WWI. The entire story is told from the perspective of John Dowell, the American husband, as he roams back and forth over the thirteen years that they were together. According to Dowell, they were all âgoodâ people, always able to affect impeccable public behavior, keep a stiff upper lip, etc. But the marriages were not what they seemed. The book is basically a long, distressing examination of their unraveling, the attempts to paper over the cracks, and the tragic consequences.The story can be tedious and trying as Dowell freely skips around in time and locale, although in actually he is telling the story after the fact. The characters are not particularly appealing, but they do garner sympathy as the inevitability that matters will not end well for them permeates the narrative. Given the date of the novel it is an amazingly open exploration of the slipperiness of human affairs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BECY1UVHXCZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141441844#wasThisHelpful","R1BECY1UVHXCZF","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kat McCall, ten years before a very rebellious teenager, was an easy target for the police to try to pin the brutal murder of her older sister Sara, Katâs legal guardian, on. Luckily, she escaped conviction in a trial and moved to Portland and became a successful operator of bakeries. Now, ten years later, she is back in Louisiana seeking justice for Sara. To say that she is unwelcome is an understatement: the threats, both verbal and physical, begin immediately and the old police chief cannot contain his antagonism. She is obviously making one or more persons very nervous.Fortunately for Kat, Police Sgt Luke Tanner, the son of the chief, responds to her first call of vandalism at her sisterâs old home because they definitely connect. Over the next few weeks they uncover evidence, especially the whereabouts of various people that had been ignored years before. It turns out that there is no shortage of plausible suspects and they are faced with the unexpected task of eliminating most of them.The story is fast-paced and the interest level is high if for no more than wanting to find out who in a small town would brutally murder a very likeable high school teacher. Itâs always easy to nitpick the believability factor in mysteries. In this case, there are plenty of stupid and inept actions taken but all are within limits of credibility. The characters are not particularly well-developed. For example, we really have no clear idea as to Katâs appearance. However, another well-constructed mystery by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGK00BI2GXDPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042461#wasThisHelpful","RGK00BI2GXDPB","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt that the book's subtitle is a substantial overstatement, but the authors' enthusiasm must be seen in the context that few even know that Washington used a spy network in New York, let alone the very real risks that those spies took. In New York, which was under British control virtually the entire War, those with Patriot and Loyalist sympathies lived side-by-side with their true feelings often well-concealed; doubtlessly, suspicions of others ran high. Spying was truly risky business; spies were subject to being hanged.New York was the center of British operations during the War and was an obsession for Washington; he hated being forced out in 1776 and always looked for ways to make inroads back into the city. He needed timely and reliable information concerning British military activities â he needed reliable spies. In 1778 Washington tasked Major Benjamin Tallmadge to come up with a facilitator and recruiter for a spy network. This is the best part of the book: the identification and recruitment of six individuals who had the disposition to be spies and their general manner of gathering and delivering information. There is a noticeable lack of specifics about what was observed, but it seems that hardly any of the information was earthshaking; actually it was fairly ordinary, a lot of it just bits and pieces overheard in coffeehouses. It is debatable as to how much essential help was actually provided. The authors include the Benedict Arnold saga in the book, but the ties to the spy ring are virtually non-existent.A lot of the book is filled with conversations that the authors simply create to make the story flow, which could be rather disconcerting to those who want their history to be strictly fact-based. They do utilize records and letters recorded and written by some of the spies and even Washington. Also quite interesting are the steps that were taken to conceal the identities of the spies, even from Washington, the use of codes and invisible ink, and the circuitous routes of transporting the materials. Only one of the spies was uncovered during the War, the one female of the group, who to this day remains unidentified. Some of the spies only became known in the 20th century.This book does fill a gap that is pretty much missing from most histories of the Revolutionary War. It took a lot of sacrifices to defeat the superior forces of the British and this book chronicles just another example of that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIIZCKA8VR3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159523103X#wasThisHelpful","R1HIIZCKA8VR3N","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Detective Lacey Flint of the London police is just now recovering from a harrowing case where a Jack-the-Ripper wannabe also targeted her. As tough as she is, Lacey also harbors many demons. When a series of alleged suicides occur at Cambridge over several years, Lacey is selected to become an undercover student. But is she the right pick? Is she not too vulnerable at this point in her life? Can she remain a neutral observer as her instructions dictate or will she follow her instincts and allow herself to be drawn into the case to a point of no return?Lacey has to sort through some pretty grim stuff in her off the record investigation; some very sinister, knowing forces must be at work. As she gets more involved, one wonders whether Detective Mark Joesbury, her on-again-off-again boyfriend, will be able to extricate her from what will inevitably be a precarious situation?The story feels a little choppy and a bit farfetched. But the author has created a plucky, interesting character in Lacey Flint. As always, it is her thinking that is of most interest.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EE0W8GUI0C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250022568#wasThisHelpful","R7EE0W8GUI0C9","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel of historical fiction is basically a vehicle for the author to explore the changing mores of mid-twentieth century America and the pressures to conform to traditional values. Louise Brooks, the silent film star of the 1920s, is a key character, but the story actually revolves around Cora Carlisle, a married woman from Wichita, KS, who chaperones Louise on a trip to NYC to attend a dancing school.Louise, the amazingly beautiful daughter of a disinterested, avant-garde mother, even at age fifteen flaunts all conventions regarding dress, appearance, bold behavior, etc. Cora has the thankless task of keeping all of that under control while in NYC. But in a strange turn in this story, it is Cora who in NYC embarks on a life of discovery and handling socially delicate situations. Coming to Kansas on a train as an orphan many years before, Cora has to this point led a fairly quiet, conventional life, although with one dark secret.From this point, such issues as homes for unwed mothers, adoption of orphans, prohibition, homosexuality, marital arrangements, contraception, civil rights, etc will impact her directly or indirectly. Cora, despite her modest and trying beginning, is portrayed as a compassionate woman capable of changing her views. In many cases, she is forced to make changes for her own survival. While Cora is a likeable character, it may be a stretch to imbue her with such a large capacity for progressive thought and action. Also, it is a little disappointing that Louise recedes in importance in this story despite her intriguing personality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQ4S8YA0NUST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631433#wasThisHelpful","RHQ4S8YA0NUST","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lots of trauma in the authorâs novels: Detective Lacey Flint, victims, co-workers, and others. Lacey is on leave from a special unit of the London police after a harrowing undercover experience at Cambridge and is not doing well, having to exercise herself to death to escape her demons. Secondly, someone is killing young boys in London and leaving them to be found with their throats cut, drained of all blood, but no other injuries.But the leading character in this mystery is eleven-year-old Barney, a neighbor of Laceyâs and observant beyond his years. His mother has been missing for years, his father too has some kind of disappearing act going on, and he happens to live in the area where the kids are dying. It is his obsession, and possible connection, with the murders that eventually draws a reluctant Lacey into the case.Itâs not just her reluctance that must be overcome: she is on the outs with her boss Detective Dana Tulloch and her relationship with fellow detective Mark Joesbury is muddled.  When matters take a far worse turn, Lacey has to jump in with typical bravado, throwing caution to the wind.Lacey is a good character for the author, although after three novels she seems a little stuck in her hang-ups and relationships. The author keeps things moving, but in this case the plot is a little thin and ultimately falls on the unbelievable side. Capturing the thinking of Lacey continues to be the strength of the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQMKJ8FM95XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042232#wasThisHelpful","R2AQMKJ8FM95XZ","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This overly long novel is definitely maudlin with an oft-told plot, but the author in the end brings it around with an intense, moving ending. Teenage Katie, bookish, plain, and mostly friendless, one day finds a stunning, new girl Tully from a broken home waiting at her bus stop. No way should they be friends, but that is exactly what they become with Tully leading the way: sneaking out at night to ride widely around town on their bikes and generally pushing the envelope of Katieâs mom.Tully decides that they will be famous reporters and they both get jobs on the edge of the TV news business during college. But Katie cannot match Tullyâs ambition and ability to exploit every opportunity. They remain close, but distant, friends as Tully becomes famous as a TV journalist, while Katie marries and has three children. There are cracks in their relationship, but all is smoothed over whenever they meet. An issue that grows larger every year is Katieâs oldest daughterâs infatuation with Tully. Eventually the cracks become a chasm which seems too large for their teenage pact of forever friendship to overcome.It is hardly unusual that teenage friendships falter for any number of reasons. Tully and Katie are pretty stereotypical characters and much different. It is as much the lure of Katieâs family for Tully that keeps them together as anything. Ultimately they face a make or break moment that will finally define who they are collectively and singularly. The author plays the melodrama card well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXTJDD3KM288/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312537077#wasThisHelpful","R1MXTJDD3KM288","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beginning in the prairies of 1930s in the midst of the Great Depression and the ecologically damaging Dust Bowl, this is a book of devastation, desperation, and survival, but eventually shifting to more hopeful possibilities. The story is told by Lila, a young girl now maybe in her early twenties, who was essentially abandoned by her family at a very young age during hard times, but rescued by a hard-nosed drifter female named Doll, who carried a very sharp knife that she used when required. Their existence is pure hardscrabble, always on the move looking for work and/or food. Eventually Lila has to fend for herself, never forgetting the kindness of the tough Doll.Again on the move, that is the background of Lilaâs arrival in Gilead, Iowa where she takes up residence in an abandoned shack on the edge of a river, but also seeks refuge in a country church where sixty-something John Ames is preaching. It is a case of the lonely meeting the lonely. Ames lost his wife and son forty years prior and is smitten by Lila. Just out of the blue, she suggests that he marry her and despite her almost indifference, it happens.The remainder of the book has Lila pondering her new life where basic needs are met and her life is shared with a kindly old preacher. Having basically adopted Dollâs no nonsense view of life, Amesâs constant praying and religious interpretations of life donât resonate with Lila, but she shows remarkable adaptability and ability to dialog with Ames given her bleak history.The story is vaguely told. Lilaâs background is more suggested than described, and there is a good bit of skipping around among various scenarios from her past. The day-to-day details of her current life with Ames are also minimally drawn. What we see are really two rather unsettled people who are coping with serious issues in their pasts and are unsure how to move ahead. The reader is left wondering just who is this Lila?","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IK34472KYXGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374187614#wasThisHelpful","R2IK34472KYXGQ","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ânuts and boltsâ spy story by a former officer of the CIA shows the complexity of recruiting and maintaining âmolesâ in sensitive areas in a foreign country, the intricacies of everyday spy-craft, and the immense pressure and danger that are always present for spies. This story is concerned primarily with the lengths to which the top spy agencies of the US and Russia will go to find a mole buried within their own governments.The incandescently beautiful Dominika Egorova, the niece of a Russian spy agency director, has been extensively trained to recruit foreign spies using her wits and her physical charms. Her first target: Nathaniel Nash, a CIA operative who has been identified as being the contact person for the US spy MARBLE within the Russian government. But that can work both ways. Can Dominika be recruited by Nate? A real cat-and-mouse game ensues in the Finish city of Helsinki, as Nate and Dominika size each other up, looking for possibilities and vulnerabilities. But this fairly self-contained operation soon explodes involving more people, different locales, violence, and unanticipated outcomes.The amount of detail in the book makes it both interesting, as well as, at times, slightly confusing and tedious. The myriad strange Russian names and the number of agencies, directorates, centers, and the like require a certain amount of backtracking. Probably reflective of the authorâs many postings, he provides glimpses of local cultures, including food, as the story shifts among locales. Most of the characters are believable, though perhaps the author could have done more with Dominika and Nate, while leaving out her supposed ability to read others by associating a color with their persona. The plot does start to strain believability in its sudden developments and harrowing close encounters. One wonders if Dominika will resurface after a return to the bowels of the Russian spy service.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJAVRIKI6M6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476706131#wasThisHelpful","R1VJAVRIKI6M6Q","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt that figuring who one is and wants to become is a very difficult task for teenagers with a lot of room for getting it wrong or slipping, especially without decent guidance from adults and family. Grace, living in small Garland, TN and coming from a dysfunctional family, sees attaching herself to the popular Riley Graham, a classmate, and the well-to-do Graham family as the avenue to a better life; and they become inseparable. It seems like a good plan, but itâs a naïve plan and Graceâs idyllic life begins to unravel.First, Graceâs attendance at NYU creates some cracks in her relationship with Riley and upon a return to Garland she comes up with a scheme involving Riley to rob an historical site of antiques. Hence the authorâs opening scene: Grace is living in Paris under an assumed name as an antique restorer as she escaped from Garland letting Riley and his pals suffer the consequences. But now they have been paroled after three years; she knows they are not happy with her. How worried should she be?The story alternates between Garland, building to her ultimate departure, and Europe where Grace has had to live by her wits, including enduring some unpleasantness and dangers. The story is not without its appeal and edginess, but Grace is not consistently drawn. At times she seems very tough and resourceful, but then comes across as quite naÃ¯ve, vulnerable, and even unknowable. Actually, she is very vaguely described. How her life plays out seems muddled and not quite believable. Ultimately, she is a rather unappealing character.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171Y55WGZX3LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427503#wasThisHelpful","R171Y55WGZX3LY","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the death by assassination of Pres James Garfield in 1881 is the main focus of this book, the author also provides some insight into some of the elements of American society in the early 1880s. Garfield, born into extreme poverty, survived a near death experience while working on a canal as a young man to become a very learned man, president of a college, a Civil War general, and a member of US Congress. Garfield, a robust man with a pleasing personality and gift for oratory, was the compromise candidate out of the Republican convention in 1880, going on to edge a weak Democratic candidate for the Presidency.The 1870s and 80s were times of considerable political corruption, where political offices were often seen as means to reward political loyalists. It is this system that ultimately harmed Garfield. Vagabond Charles Guiteau, a failure in all of his endeavors and a petty thief, repeatedly intruded on the offices of Garfield and Sec of State James Blaine, insisting that he should be given an ambassadorship. Rejected at all turns, he decided that only Garfieldâs death would permit any such appointment.From todayâs perspective, an era of science and security, the authorâs description of the scenario around Garfield is almost impossible to comprehend. Despite Lincolnâs assassination a mere fifteen years prior, Garfield had absolutely no security detail. He literally walked around Washington at will. Secondly, the ineptitude of the American doctors in that time can scarcely be believed. The American medical community rejected as ridiculous the advances that European doctors made concerning sterile environments, finding concern about germs to be pure silliness.Led by the pompous Dr. Willard Bliss, the doctors surrounding Garfield gave no thought to probing his wounds with their unwashed hands. Bliss kept Garfield isolated and pronounced that he was improving despite the drainage of vile liquids and the loss of nearly 100 lbs. An autopsy revealed that Garfield had massive infections throughout his body. Had he never been touched, Garfield probably would have lived, as were thousands of Civil War veterans walking around with musket balls in them.  It can be  noted that even today tens of thousands die each year in the US from the introduction of infections by healthcare facilities.The author, strangely enough, devotes considerable time to the efforts of Alexander Bell, the inventor of the telephone, to devise a crude instrument to detect metal in a patient once he learned of Garfieldâs wounds. All of that was too little, too late for Garfield. It is the remarkable strength of character of both Garfield and his wife Lucretia that stands out in the authorâs story. Interestingly, Vice Pres Chester Arthur gained a measure of respect after Garfieldâs death by rejecting the influence of former New York Senator Roscoe Conkling.The book is not without interest, but it seems like an overdrawn overview with a good deal of repetition. Her story is really rather simple: âGood guy president is shot by a nut and his doctors finished him off.â","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJ4OJS6U8F6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767929713#wasThisHelpful","R1GJ4OJS6U8F6C","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the North Georgia mountains in the mid-1960âs, this haunting, but improbable, story brings together two much damaged, needy persons into a loving, volatile, and ultimately flawed relationship. Katherine Reid, an advertising executive and nearly forty, after a diagnosis of a terminal illness, buys a very remote, barebones cabin to live out her remaining days in utter simplicity and isolation. Little does she know that Danny MacLean, a twenty-something traumatized Vietnam vet with a very troubled past, is squatting in an even more inhabitable cabin near hers.Katherine actually begins to thrive in her spartan existence while Dannyâs concealed observation of her becomes an obsession. Their initial meetings are quite tentative, but soon hesitation gives way to a relationship that is both intensely physical and controlling. Of course, this headlong rush into intimacy will eventually have to deal with all of the psychological issues that have been lurking.There is a lot to like about this book. The author definitely captures the difficulties and perils of a remote, restricted life. While it is hard to imagine Katherine as a mountain woman, one can understand that these two damaged people in this setting could be inclined to cling to one another in an almost death-like grip. The real question is what can/will happen long term?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSNPCGDFQ1KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176957#wasThisHelpful","R3FSNPCGDFQ1KW","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This murder mystery set in London introduces Detective Lacey Flint, as she is part of a team desperately trying to capture a killer of women who operates in the manner of and sends notes evocative of the Jack-the-Ripper, while she has to contend with and keep hidden a troubled past. Disturbingly, the killer seems to be taunting and stalking Lacey.Lacey is a tough nut, a little hard to figure out, and tends to indulge in risky behavior. For example, she frequents places where hook-ups are possible and follows through on that. An intriguing part of the story is her relationship with Scotland Yard undercover officer Mark Joesbury, who is drawn to Lacey but strongly suspects that she is withholding information on the case.The pacing of the story gets a bit slow at times, but the unknowns lurking around the corner keep the pages turning.

"The dedicated, wily veteran detective Harry Bosch of the recently revamped LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit and his newly assigned partner Detective Lucia Soto have a case that is both old and new. Orlando Merced, the leader of a mariachi band, was shot and paralyzed ten years ago in a plaza where bands go to get gigs, the bullet lodging in his spine. Now, Merced has died from blood poisoning from the projectile. Because former mayor Armando Zeyas used Merced as a poster boy in his campaign to fight crime, the LAPD has come under pressure to solve this case.All who know the crusty Bosch from previous books, know that he leaves no stone unturned when digging for evidence and that he works the police process as well as anyone, having connections in all of the right places. In this case, Bosch thinks that everyone may have it wrong. Careful analysis of the crime scene seems to suggest that Merced was not the target in the shooting, and that the path leads to some well-connected, powerful people.Parallel to this case, Lucia has been secretly digging into the Bonnie Brae apartment fire of twenty years ago; it was a case of arson and she, herself, as youngster in that building, barely survived.  Harry agrees to assist Lucy, and discovers, strangely enough, that another crime on the date of the fire appears to be connected to that case. Ordinarily Harry would be soundly rebuked by the higher-ups for letting his attention be diverted, but this is another politically sensitive case which would make the captain look good if it was solved.The book is fairly consistent with previous Harry Bosch books, although his tolerance for newbie Lucy is a little out of character. One learns the streets of LA as Bosch drives among all of the law enforcement agencies, meets his contacts, and interviews witnesses and suspects. Characters from previous books make nominal appearances, including his teen-age daughter Maddie and an old flame from the FBI Rachael Walling. However, the author gives us very little of Bosch's personal life in this book. How to work a case and the education of Detective Soto take center stage. A quibble with the book is the rather muddled ending of the two cases. In addition, at the end a charge by a police official that Harry violated police procedures looks contrived.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSY55AR2VCUTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316225932#wasThisHelpful","RSY55AR2VCUTB","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this fourteenth book of the series, Kate Shugak, a pint-sized, native Alaskan investigator and resident of a vast wilderness called the Park, shifts the locus of her work to Anchorage to investigate a thirty-year-old case of possible wrongful conviction. Geography is not the only change in Kate this time around. Never before has she been willing to use her lithe, athletic, and sexy body to virtually paralyze and overwhelm a tough Alaskan trooper.Kate is skeptical when an exquisitely decked out, middle-aged socialite Charlotte insists that her mother Victoria was wrongfully accused and convicted of setting the family home on fire in which one son died and another was permanently injured in jumping from a window. Working with practically no evidence, Kate's quest takes her among the movers and shakers of Alaskan society, but more importantly seems to be worrying someone. People she wants to talk to or has talked to start turning up dead or hurt.The book is fast-paced with an interesting plot that is solvable for the highly observant. Somewhat disconcertingly, secondary characters appear briefly or are mentioned who have been defined in some of the earlier books. The Alaskan landscape, prominent in earlier books, is scarcely mentioned in this book. In addition, while Kate is a force to be reckoned with, in a couple of scenarios she exhibits physical powers in dealing with bad guys that are more like Wonder Woman than a real person. As always, a large half-wolf mutt Mutt is a formidable companion for Kate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2969IM8QQ9SU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312985657#wasThisHelpful","R2969IM8QQ9SU0","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If one needs more evidence that girls from broken homes and squalid environments are likely headed for lives with unhappy consequences, this is your book. In this case, the story is of two high school girls: Baby Girl is the tough, punker chick with a shaved head, glaring lipstick, and dressed in her brotherâs clothes, while Perry is the looker who generally defers to Baby Girl. Perry lives with her prison-guard stepdad and her once-pretty mother, now a boozer. Baby Girl lives with her uncle and brain-damaged older brother.These girls are trouble. Their favorite activity is to go carousing in the wee hours of the night: stealing cars for joy rides, drinking, and committing petty theft. Theyâre no better in school with their sleep-deprived disruptiveness. But there is a palpable sense that their obnoxious behavior and boldness will eventually have serious consequences.Theyâve both been carrying on a text message dialog with a mysterious âJamey,â supposedly a high school student. Though not boy crazy, neither rejects male attention, especially the striking Perry. However, on a rainy night, their pasts, attitudes, and naivetÃ© all come together in a shocking meeting with the shadowy Jamey. Now where do they turn?While the sleazy nature of trailer park living is hardly unknown, the author gets it perfectly. Unfortunately, the story moves surely and inevitably to a conclusion that, while not necessarily predictable, is completely consistent with having lived in an environment where a turn for the worse is far more likely than realizing oneâs potential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8J8NAJVO443/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374533865#wasThisHelpful","R2S8J8NAJVO443","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this fourth installment of the Frank Bascombe series, Frank, the authorâs alter ego, is sixty-eight and is now having to seriously confront the ebbing away of his life to this point. Those familiar with Frank in the authorâs three previous novels know him to be quite likeable but cautious and wary with a sense that the other shoe is ready to drop.In this collection of four pieces, Frank hasnât changed much, but he is if anything even more philosophical and seeing and resigned. He constantly points out convenient fictions that govern much behavior - even his own. Interestingly, appreciating that his life is in decline seems to instill an overriding calmness in Frank in his dealings with others.The stories take place in Nov and Dec of 2012 in New Jersey, where hurricane Sandy has just wreaked massive destruction. In âIâm Here,â Frank is placed in the awkward position of meeting a man to whom he sold a now destroyed seaside mansion years ago. While the loss of property is certainly dramatic, Frank is far more chagrined with the manâs artificial appearance after plastic surgery. In âThe New Normal,â Frank visits his ex-wife in an up-scale nursing home, while understandingly reviewing their attraction and decline.While it is interesting to revisit Frank Bascombe and his unfiltered view of life, the rather disconnected scenarios in this book do not have the appeal of the better plotted previous books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PO4FUIV6TU98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061692069#wasThisHelpful","R2PO4FUIV6TU98","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This often vacuous, melodramatic, and tedious novel is concerned with the behavior of a recovering, forty-year-old divorcee. Stella has figured out how to read and seduce men, which she uses to satisfy her desires as she flies around the country on weekends targeting men in airport hotels and bars. Though Stella is reasonably attractive, the author shares nothing of her background suggesting a predilection for or a belief in her one night stands. Secondly, the avoidance of disease, violence, and other complications seems wishful.And then suddenly â too suddenly â one of the men becomes more than a one-nighter. The melodrama is ratcheted up considerably as the gory, traumatic details of their pasts, including needy ex-spouses and children, intrude on this supposed love affair. Although there are plenty of graphic details of Stellaâs encounters, the characters donât have enough appeal to carry the book. There really is no plot. The best thing about this book is that it ends.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YXN6VZD8K4W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831622X#wasThisHelpful","R2YXN6VZD8K4W0","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think a life cannot be ruined in a heartbeat? Matt Hunter, a college student, comes to the rescue of a pal being beaten up at a drunken party, but accidentally kills someone. A jury, showing no mercy, sends him away for several years to a prison for hardened criminals. Never again will he view life the same. Now, ten years later, he is married to the beautiful Olivia and works as a paralegal at his brother's law firm, but Matt retains a perpetual wariness. No wonder - he is buying a house in his old neighborhood, but a town cop lets him know that he is not welcome. His past is not going away.Sure enough, Matt's newfound life does not last. Olivia, supposedly out of town on business, seems to send him a video of her in a hotel room with an unknown man. This is the start of a great unraveling of his life that ripples far and wide. It turns out that Olivia, who Matt met one weekend in Las Vegas while in college, also has a past that she would like to forget, but this time there are some serious, dangerous implications.The story quickly gets rather involved, extending back to Las Vegas and even reaching into a Catholic school in New Jersey. With several people turning up dead, Matt and Olivia have to go into full-on scramble mode to keep their pasts from burying them, while trying to come out the other end alive. The story threatens to derail at a few convoluted points, but actually is fairly interesting and manages to hang on by a slender plausible thread. Matt, being a sympathetic character keeps the reader's interest to the end, but most interesting is the stunning, Amazonian investigator Cingle. The author is known for creating transfixing secondary characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHZPKX7YKB9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045121577X#wasThisHelpful","R3LHZPKX7YKB9X","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this short mystery set in the barren wilds of Alaska, the tough, thirty-something investigator Kate Shugak is introduced. She has been asked by her ex-boss based in the Anchorage DAâs office to track down a missing park ranger and an investigator sent earlier to find the ranger. Frankly, the plot is really not well developed and is both rather simplistic and jumbled.Kate lives a hermetic existence on the edge of a huge national park in a very tidy setting after suffering a traumatic injury over a year before. The atmospherics of Alaskan living almost dominates the book: the conditions are trying and dangerous. In addition, the book is more sociological than mystery. The conflicts between âgreeniesâ (environmentalists), âoutsidersâ (non- Alaskans), and native Alaskans, in addition to the animosities between those who want to make the national parks tourist friendly and those who want to keep control with profit in mind permeate most of the interactions.At this point Kate lacks definition and is a little rough around the edges. In fact, all of the characters seem a bit too far on the quirky side. It is doubtful that the Alaskan tourism industry would recommend this book. There is promise in the book but needs to be tightened up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L967JE7EMX2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042513301X#wasThisHelpful","R3L967JE7EMX2Q","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short mystery set in the rural, coastal town of Binnacle Bay is an entertaining and fast-paced read with a well-devised plot and interesting and/or shadowy characters. Much to Chief of Police Pat Fitzlaffâs dismay, he finds well-respected architect Gus Murdoch shot dead in his secluded cabin and his wife Sasha is missing. There are no clues, but there is a crumpled note in Gusâ hand from Sasha giving her itinerary from the previous day. And a large, friendly dog of mysterious origin is found on the scene.The likeable Fitzlaff immediately encounters resistance in his investigation. The mayor wants a quick resolution â any will do â to save the townâs reputation for tourism, and several others seem to be lying or have a shaky past. Pat, who has a history with Sasha, canât dismiss the possibility that Sashaâs nosey journalism may have gotten her in trouble.Pat, an ex-Marine, has a certain rugged appeal and attracts female attention, although the author seems reluctant to pursue that path. However, it is his calm command of the situation plus an ability to think out of the box that enables Pat to move assuredly to a resolution that he did not expect. The authorâs descriptive powers also bear mentioning. The mist-shrouded landscape, the crashing sea, and the dense forests most definitely contribute to the feeling of danger lurking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNSDVE21YMCP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500704091#wasThisHelpful","RNSDVE21YMCP3","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Sydney, this somewhat suspenseful novel involves the fallout of the actions and interconnections of a group of students and young adults that occurred over twenty years ago. Now, nearing middle-age, these various individuals are hard-pressed to keep their lives from disintegrating as the past re-enters their lives.What happens is that Ceciia Fitzpatrick, married to John-Paul, inadvertently finds a letter that he wrote many years ago that is to be opened upon his death. His strange, distant behavior of late compels her to read the letter. The letter undermines the very basis of their marriage, but even she does not fully understand the reach of the letter. In another thread, Tess is astounded to learn that her husband Will and her cousin Felicity have fallen in love with each other. And Rachael has never come to terms with the strangulation murder of her daughter Janie in those earlier years. All of these lives will again intersect in trying circumstances.Getting past the melodrama of the book, the story is not without its insights into the regrets and ramifications of the actions of individuals. Furthermore, there is the inherent difficulty of really knowing others and how to respond to them. However, the characters are not particularly appealing. Most seem overly self-absorbed and wounded, but manage to stumble into the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0ANAIPUJ9NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159347#wasThisHelpful","R3A0ANAIPUJ9NY","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of the very sudden appearance of a 75,000 person city just west of Knoxville in the mid-1940's is not well known and this book certainly is not without merit in the telling of the story, but its execution leaves one grasping for a good understanding of the background of the entire project and many details of what occurred at Oak Ridge.Once the US realized that an atomic bomb was possible and could immediately terminate WWII, the need to produce the all important isotope of uranium for the bomb became imperative. A very secure place was needed for a huge complex of sophisticated facilities. The first priority was the accelerated construction of several massive factories, but of equal importance was the hiring of tens of thousands people almost overnight and providing adequate infrastructure, including streets, housing, food, etc. The people needed ranged from construction workers, clerks, operators, and janitors to nurses, doctors, and thousands of technical and scientific personnel. To personalize the story, the author selects a few representative women to follow, but, for the most part, they are only minimally captured.Several aspects of the Clinton Engineer Works CEW (Oak Ridge) are repeated over and over in the author's story. First is the incredible security surrounding the entire project. Virtually no one knew why they were there. Most performed a very circumscribed task. Badges permitted entry only to one's work place. Everyone was prohibited from discussing any aspect of their job with anyone: fellow workers, roommates, family, etc. And there were tons of undercover people to enforce those strictures. Many people were escorted out of the facility for talking too much. Perhaps they said the word ""uranium""? However, there was a justified fear of spies. Later it was discovered that spies did infiltrate the CEW.In addition, the living conditions were atrocious. The sudden carving of a city out of the earth left a lot to be desired. The Southern afternoon rainstorms made walking almost impossible; those who tried frequently sunk to their knees in gooey muck. The housing for many was crowded pre-fab huts. There was onerous male-female separation, even among the married. Of course, Oak Ridge being in the South, there was racial segregation. Most of the women that the author profiles got used to the conditions; the pay that was much better than could be made in local businesses helped considerably. The conditions and restrictions did create a lot stress. In the modern era probably half of the workforce would be under the care of a psychologist, but there were few such options for the workers of Oak Ridge.The dropping of the two bombs on Japan in early Aug, 1945 came as a shock to the workers of the CEW. They literally had no idea that they were producing the key part of the Gadget (bomb) that was being made in Los Alamos, NM. As the author shows, many did not know whether to be thrilled or horrified. While part of the CEW remained operational and does to this very day, the facility shrunk to one half of its size and most of the workers returned to their previous homes.The Oak Ridge story is both quaint and almost hard to believe. Unfortunately, in this case, its telling is a bit trying. The story is often repetitious, tedious, and scattershot. One suspects that there has been much left unsaid in regard to details and perspective.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPALQHMIT6UH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451617534#wasThisHelpful","RRPALQHMIT6UH","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the modern era there seems to be no limits to the deceptions that can be perpetrated on the Internet. Internet dating, virtually by definition, heads the list; everyone presents an imagined self. But things can get far more sinister. How about creating a totally false profile with a borrowed picture and then attracting persons for purposes of criminal intent? That is exactly the scenario that NYPD detective Kat Donavan stumbles into. Her finance from eighteen years ago seems to be staring at her on a dating site. She finally gets the nerve to email him. But he has no idea who she is; how can that be?Kat has a lot going on in her life. At the same time as the dating site snafu, the supposed killer of her father, a former NYPD policeman, is dying in prison eighteen years after being convicted. The problem is that she does not believe that he did it; his death will close that door forever. In addition, she gets a call from a teenage hacker who is upset that Kat is talking to the guy on the Internet who also happens to be dating his mother. Matters soon get rather complicated, even threatening.There are a lot of threads in this fast moving mystery. It is a juggling act, but slowly the author connects a lot of disparate people and events ranging over eighteen years. Kat is an appealing main character. There is enough plausibility in what happens to keep the reader's interest. Also, the story plays on fears of never really fully knowing just who one is dealing with on the other end of an Internet connection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZNTGAGLTBHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953493#wasThisHelpful","R26ZNTGAGLTBHB","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A subject that gets relatively little attention is what anyone believed a new American would look like after declaring independence from England in 1776. It actually took twenty-five years for that question to be somewhat resolved largely due to the huge influences of Jefferson and Hamilton in the 1790s who were the leaders of the two main political factions of the day, that is, the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. It is still debated as to which of those two most represents what America has become.Winning the war against England was foremost in the minds of the colonists in the late 1770sâ and early 80s; frankly there wasnât time for a coherent national policy. Yet there were serious cracks in the new United States that begged for resolution. The national political framework, that is, The Articles of Confederation, had no real power to compel compliance from the independent states in conducting national policies. There was no national economic or financial policy, the American army was hugely undersupplied, and the various states struggled with where to draw the line in permitting democratic governance. Consequently, only a few years after the War, the social and economic elites of the colonies came together in the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 to form the US Constitution, which provided for a strong national government.The author actually spends over one-half of his book in showing that Jefferson and Hamilton came to the 90âs via drastically different paths with virtually no interaction. The well-educated, philosophical, and reserved Jefferson, from Virginiaâs agrarian elite, authored the Declaration of Independence and remained in Virginia during the War. After the War, he served as an envoy to France for five years, missing the Constitutional Convention. The talented, ambitious Hamilton arrived in New York from the Caribbean in 1772 and attended Kingâs College, but is best known for being Washingtonâs top aide-de-camp during most of the War. At the Constitutional Convention, he so desired a strong national government that he suggested a president-for-life executive. He campaigned vigorously for the passage of the Constitution through his authorship of most of the essays in the Federalist Papers.However, it was as Secretaries of State and Treasury beginning in Washingtonâs first term in 1789, that Jefferson and Hamilton began an intense rivalry that subsided only with Jeffersonâs election to the Presidency in 1800. The core of their differences revolved around the size and scope of the national government. And Hamilton won most of their battles. He wanted a national debt funded by wealthy Americans; he paid the War bonds heavily speculated on at face value; he assumed the War debts of the states; he established a national bank; and he advocated the establishment of manufacturing. Particularly galling to Jefferson and fellow Republicans was Hamiltonâs desire to form a powerful state in the image of England. On the other hand, Jefferson envisioned an America of mostly independent farmers with a minimalist national government. Furthermore, he and the Republicans supported the revolutionary movement in France, which abhorred conservative Federalists. There were several more chapters in the contentiousness among the two including the Jay Treaty, the XYZ affair, and the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Federalists were the initiators of government policies in this decade, but the Republicans constantly chipped away at their head start and set a very different course with Jeffersonâs election in 1800.There is no doubt that the modern US is permeated with huge commercial enterprises, has a strong banking system, and is a world power with a vast military apparatus. That points to holding that Hamilton is truly the visionary. However, Americans have always been skeptical of power, either private or public, and are fierce defenders of liberty. They value independence. That all suggests that Jefferson is actually the one in tune with Americansâ core beliefs.The book does a fairly good job of detailing the fundamental differences between Jefferson and Hamilton, but it is a short book and is really only a overview. Over half the book merely describes their parallel journeys to their years of contention. In addition, the author devotes some time to their personal failings some of which are only marginally relevant, although Hamiltonâs volatile and paranoid personality was a source of trouble for him. The book is a nice introduction to the first and most important decade in the formation of the Union.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183XRSXKXJQT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608195430#wasThisHelpful","R183XRSXKXJQT1","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in 1945 wartime Moscow, this historical novel is an attempt to recapture the actual killing of two teenage children of elite Communist Party officials. However, to be precise, the book is far more concerned with the fear that pervades a totalitarian society where every action and word is scrutinized for its adherence to Party dogma and rules. Since everyone is potentially an informant, conformity of behavior is essential.In this story, a small group of literature students of the Stalin Commune School 801 have formed the Fatal Romantics' Club. When two of them are shot during a supposedly harmless game, their elite status and unusual interests attract the attention of the Russian state security apparatus. The lack of check on those with absolute power is shown when friends, brothers, and sisters of those in the Club are subjected to relentless questioning inside a prison as though they were enemies of the state.Doubtlessly, life in the Soviet Union in that era was grim and brutal, but the author has created simple stereotypes throughout the book, who seem more like cartoon characters than real individuals. Much of the behavior is over-the-top in terms of its ignorance, arbitrariness, brutality, etc.By far the best part of the book is in the following of the love affairs of two characters, one a senior at the School, the other a top Communist official, which demonstrates quite poignantly the difficulties of finding personal space in a society where everyone is monitored.While the plight of some of the characters at the hands of the Soviet state certainly invokes sympathy, overall, the book lacks the consistency, connectedness, subtlety, and believability to be compelling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLG1HASY5ZXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291882#wasThisHelpful","R2CLG1HASY5ZXM","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â¦ is the way to describe the authorâs latest murder mystery set near Dublin, Ireland with all of the spot-on Irish flavor and attitudes that dot all of her previous works. The backdrop to this story is a private, prestigious school for teenage girls, St. Kildaâs School, with all of the emotions and drama present that often pervade settings where girls are trying to find themselves and establish relationships with both girls and guys. A blemish on the Schoolâs image is that a year ago, Chris Harper, a student at an adjacent boysâ school, was found bludgeoned to death on the campus. However, the case was relegated to the cold-case bin in the Dublin police department.But suddenly, a year later, a note is pinned to a special bulletin board at St. Kildaâs claiming to know who killed Chris. Enter young, ambitious cold-case detective Stephen Moran and murder squad detective Antoinette Conway, a tough, no-nonsense, and disliked female. Over a very long day, Moran and Conway encounter any number of female cliques at St. Kildaâs who are determined to bury facts, mislead investigators, and protect their friends. Using group rivalries, sharp observations, and subtle pressure, Moran and Conway slowly eliminate suspects.The day is long and the endless interviews at times become tedious, but it is entirely believable that it would take considerable time to peel away the many subterfuges initiated by these girls about this case. The relationship of Moran and Conway is pretty shaky, especially given the volatility of Conway, but they discover that they complement each other well in their approaches. The story is interesting with continual new developments that keep the detectives scrambling to stay in the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBO4799DIDOOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026328#wasThisHelpful","RBO4799DIDOOE","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Only the most naïve individuals believe that Southern slaves were actually freed by various proclamations and Constitutional amendments in the 1860's. This work by a Southern-born journalist is another chapter in the unconscionable story of Southern elites keeping freedmen in virtually slavery for decades after the Civil War.The emphasis in this rather scattershot book is the criminalization of ordinary behavior that was enforced only against blacks. Not having a job, being out at night, being disrespectful to bosses, speaking loudly around white women, etc would get one hauled before a judge. What followed is nothing short of a conspiracy among law enforcement, the legal system, and business and agricultural elites. The guilty parties invariably could not pay the court-imposed fines or numerous tacked-on fees. The offending persons are then leased to an individual or a business for months, if not years, to pay off the fine. In that custody, they were treated as ordinary criminals and subjected to brutal work regimes and conditions, often being chained to work stations. The death rate among these leased persons was extraordinarily high. Inspectors, being a part of the conspiracy, never reported these atrocious conditions.Of course, this leasing system was only one means to keep blacks under control. The author also discusses the terror perpetrated by such organizations as the Ku Klux Klan and the suppression of voting rights. And then there was the sharecropping system, where small farmers were in perpetual debt to large landholders and local store owners. The so-called New South was not really so new after all. The revival of the South was built on the subjugation of freedmen no less onerous than the system of slavery before the War.The author intermittently focuses on one family grouping, both white and black, who lived in an Alabama county going back nearly two hundred years to show the details of this suppression. The book is written in journalistic mode with lots of names and digressions. The book makes for pretty grim reading. It is a terrible black mark on American history to realize that we as a nation permitted, even to some degree justified, this egregious treatment of freedmen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4NN9NXTY7CYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385722702#wasThisHelpful","R4NN9NXTY7CYG","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thirty-something and widowed Celia Cassill, the owner of a small Brooklyn apartment building, believes in privacy and separateness. She only marginally knows the long-retired ferry captain on the fourth floor, the middle-aged couple on the third, and George and his current boyfriend on the second floor. When Celia permits Georgeâs friend Hope, a very striking forty-something woman, to sub-let Georgeâs apartment, she cannot fathom that her content, controlled world would soon be unglued.But Hope is not as on top of her game as she seems; she is reeling from a divorce action. It is not long before Celia realizes that Hope is permitting herself to be debased by a former male friend. Beyond her insistence that lives remain private, Celia is especially affected by Hopeâs encounters because she had a similar experience with a stranger met on a NYC subway shortly after her husbandâs death. The psychology of all of this is rather tricky, but Celia finds herself being drawn into Hopeâs orbit with a strong desire to assuage what Hope is missing.Most of the book is what is going on in Celiaâs mind, as she has carefully constructed a life to move on from her husbandâs death. It is interesting to watch her scramble when Hope enters her world and other apartment problems intrude. Perhaps one could wish for more resolution at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32MLJ046S0FKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250050308#wasThisHelpful","R32MLJ046S0FKX","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This somewhat drawn out novel is concerned with life directions taken by two best high school friends, Mia and Lorrie Ann, and how their choices and circumstances impact and reflect their friendship. Both are from modest situations, but are quite a bit different. Mia is the tougher of the two, while Lorrie Ann is more attractive, good-hearted, and sees the best in others. Considering their ordinariness, it is surprising that the author has Mia, year's later, pursuing post-graduate mythology studies in Istanbul, while the pristine Lorrie Ann experiences any number of tragedies and is in a downward spiral.The focus of the book is on Lorrie Ann, as seen by Mia, and on her trials and tribulations. Slowly the details of Lorrie Ann's life are revealed, causing Mia no little consternation, puzzlement, and feelings of helplessness. Meeting in Istanbul many years later, Mia is again drawn to her but really cannot fully understand who she has become. Basically, Mia finally realizes that the bonds of deep friendship have no guarantees; some people will never be fully revealed.The book feels unbalanced. The beautiful, saintly Lorrie Ann is idealized at first, but then she is cut down at every turn. Meanwhile, Mia escapes her own shortcomings. Eventually, the Lorrie Ann/Mia saga becomes overstated and wearisome.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WAR2DBVK1M57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351968#wasThisHelpful","R1WAR2DBVK1M57","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What could be more exciting than love at first sight? Carol, an exquisite looking, older NYC socialite, and Therese, an attractive counter girl at a NYC department store, are both immediately taken by each other. That is not particularly remarkable, except for the fact that the year is about 1950 and there is virtually no tolerance for such love.The story is told from Thereseâs perspective and details her feelings, doubts, and joy as her relationship with Carol haltingly proceeds. Carol, with the most to lose, has to contend with others, including her husband, attempting to assail the status quo of her life. Most interesting is the several week long car trip that they take through the mid-West that is very critical to their relationship.

The author has to be credited for a very perceptive treatment of a controversial topic some sixty-five years ago.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU924NL0UZ8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1469971879#wasThisHelpful","RZU924NL0UZ8V","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a collection of about 70 articles culled from the website of the New Georgia Encyclopedia that pertain to the Civil War in Georgia. The articles are grouped as Prelude to War, The War Years, and The Warâs Legacy, but are so short that the book is perhaps best viewed as a âsamplerâ of the Civil War. The book is intended to give a flavor and a feel to the Civil War in Georgia, but is inadequate for a deeper understanding of the Civil War.Most of the significant battles that occurred in Georgia get a chapter; however, disappointingly, very few maps are provided to clarify the maneuvers. Supporting institutions such as hospitals, manufacturing facilities, railroads, newspapers, and prisons primarily located in Georgiaâs main cities are recognized. In addition, the situation for unionists, deserters, dissenters, women, and slaves are described.As this collection makes evident, control of the memories of the Civil War has always been very important to Southerners. Various cities, sites, organizations, activities, books, films, etc have sought to favorably depict the Civil War dating from its conclusion to the present day. In particular, the so-called âlost causeâ theme is often advanced. According to this idea, the Confederacy was a gallant cause waged by honorable men to fend off the depredations of unscrupulous Yankees. Slavery, according to them, was a benign part of Southern life that Yankee invaders destroyed. Some of the articles are critical of this idea, but others are accepting.In many ways the book and the online site are exasperating in their neutrality and passivity to the realities of the South, the Civil War, and slavery. One article in the first section claims that the Civil War was âvery much a political war,â that occurred due to political failure. What is not said, is that âfire-eatingâ Southern social and economic elites drove the political process. America has never figured how to give average citizens a meaningful voice in the political process. An article on Reconstruction scarcely mentions the incredible violence perpetrated on blacks and sympathizers, which continued through several decades of Jim Crow. One author amazingly suggests that blacks and whites hammered out an agreement about freedom after the War.The book is no more than a very minimalist introduction to the Civil War. Some of the places and organizations that remember the Civil War are not found in traditional histories, so may be useful. To learn about the Civil War and its aftermath such books such as David Potterâs The Impending Crisis, James McPhersonâs Battle Cry of Freedom, and Eric Fonerâs Reconstruction must be consulted.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R80GCAR4WEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0820339814#wasThisHelpful","R21R80GCAR4WEK","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this somewhat awkward, pieced together story, Joan, a second-tier ballerina, has a fling with up and coming Russian star dancer Arslan Rusakow in Paris - even helping him escape to the West. But, then it's back to high school sweetheart Jacob, who has been patiently waiting on Joan for years, and to a desultory existence in the suburban sprawl of southern California. Her son Harry is the only bright spot in her life, especially when she discovers in her dance studio that Harry is a ballet talent.Both Harry and Chloe, Harry's childhood friend, quickly ascend up the rungs of ballet, being selected for ever more elite training and experiences. Of course, at the highest rung is still Arslan. It is inevitable that Joan will again cross paths with him. Also unavoidable are the revelations of the entirety of her relationship with Arslan, much to the dismay of her family.Overall the story is rather lackluster; the author's injection of bits of melodrama does not rescue the book. None of the characters really spring to life. The author does capture the demands and cruelties of the ballet world; there is a rigid pecking order. The book really does not deliver up to its potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZS6LA2G3Q0SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307962903#wasThisHelpful","R1ZS6LA2G3Q0SG","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this relatively short work, well-known Civil War historian William Freehling discusses the miscalculations and misperceptions of white Southern secessionists and the deft handling of the Civil War crisis by Lincoln that ensured that the rebellious South had little chance of succeeding in their audacious act. The most glaring error of those leading the charge to succeed was their belief that slave-holding states would take a unified stand against the Union - that all Southerners were on the same page. In addition, their weird and oft-repeated idea that slavery was a form of paternalism was found to be totally false, as blacks deserted their former masters in droves when opportunities were presented.The author breaks the South into three critical regions: Border, Middle, and the Lower South. Only the Lower South had significant regions of large slaveholdings. Deep South plantation owners should have appreciated that fact moreso. Lincoln, actually a fairly conservative Republican, ensured the neutrality of whites in the upper regions of the South by his refusal to touch the institution of slavery in the first two years of the War. This permitted Union armies to operate with little opposition in those states and enabled them to control vital rail lines that connected the Lower South to industrial output in the North and to facilitate quick Union troop movements.The author points out that the South supplied 300,000 white soldiers to the Union cause and an additional 150,000 black troops. Also, as Union forces occupied greater portions of the South, thousands of fugitive slaves joined Union camps to perform backbreaking labor, freeing Union soldiers to fight battles. The South had no equivalent segments of the population to augment their armies after huge loses as did the Union.It is certainly true that the North had a huge advantage in the War from the very start in terms of population and industrial capability. But as the author demonstrates in this book, it is the divisions in the South that expanded that advantage permitting the Union to slowly strangle the South in a devastating defeat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22KYTMKPVNBCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195156293#wasThisHelpful","R22KYTMKPVNBCQ","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sculling is actually quite complex and the author hardly shies away from those complexities. There is so much to be aware of and to perform simultaneously: oar position: height, depth, length of travel, and rotation; the motion and posture of the body involving legs, back, arms, shoulders, and hands; and boat movement: water line, stability, boat check, etc, not to mention boat setup and equipment involving rigging, foot stretchers, oar selection, etc.While the author covers some rudiments of sculls and rowing, that is not his focus. He is far more concerned with the complexities mentioned and the many ways that rowers violate them and methods for correction. For beginners, this book would be pretty obscure: their heads would be spinning after trying to get through it. Experienced rowers looking to make subtle improvements in their rowing would perhaps be the main beneficiaries of this book, however, even then the brevity of the book makes explanations very succinct.The problem with the book is that the author seems to feel that he has written a basic book on sculling. It is not a basic book. It is more likely to be intimidating to an inexperienced sculler, rather than helpful. Somewhat grating is that despite so much emphasis on technicalities, the author suggests that rowers need to ""feel"" the right way to row. That seems contradictory.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5GVGI60ANP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0967465109#wasThisHelpful","R2S5GVGI60ANP6","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rather intense novel is concerned with the relentless mental and physical stresses that are part of elite rowing programs and how all of that can ripple out into later years. Rob Carrey, an accomplished senior high school sculler in western New York, has been given a rowing scholarship as a post-graduate student to the elite Fenton prep school, hopefully, for him, as a stepping stone to Harvard. Now, fifteen years later, having become a documentary filmmaker, he has been summoned back to Fenton for his fifteenth year reunion, not to mention the death of one of his crewmates.At Fenton, no longer is Rob the BMOC. In the first place, he had been unaware that his scholarship is for a rower on a four-man sweep boat. The only goal is to beat the rival Warwick team in the spring. And iconic, crusty coach Channing and the blueblood, mainstay of the crew Connor are unhappy that Rob is unwilling or unable to modify his rowing technique to get the necessary speed to win the race.The story is revealed as it shifts back and forth in time from present-day NYC where Rob is breaking up with his longtime girlfriend Carolyn to the past of Felton where Rob is trying to adjust to his crew including the enigmatic and demanding Ruth, the first female coxswain at Felton.For rowing aficionados, the detailed rowing information and the intense training will definitely grab one's attention. However, while one can hardly discount the immense pressures of sports, the drama that surrounds Rob at both Fenton and now in his present life seems somewhat overly done; he seems more resourceful than the author permits. His crewmates and his girlfriend are likewise underdeveloped and not well understood. The book's ending also falls a little flat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZY4FSNN4C8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125003003X#wasThisHelpful","R1GZY4FSNN4C8D","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This moderate sized book is meant to be an easily read, overview of the American Revolution beginning briefly with the French-Indian War and concluding with the election of Washington as the first President. The rudiments of the Americansâ grievances with Britain are explored, but there is only minimal discussion of the deeper political, legal issues. The culture and views of the average colonist are not concerns of the author.Most of the book is devoted to the American military campaigns, especially the strategies and actions of General Washington. The author hardly whitewashes the Americansâ efforts. There were disconnects everywhere: troops not being where they were supposed to be; huge shortages of supplies ranging from food, shelter, and armaments; inept military leadership; etc. And, clearly, the ineffectualness of the US Congress and the Articles of Confederation very nearly cost America the war. The war was very protracted with huge loss of life and property. However, in the authorâs telling a few key military leaders, soldiers who overcame tremendous hardships, and timely, sometimes lucky, military actions finally turned the tide against Britain.The author paints Washington as practically a saint in his patience, perseverance, and tolerance for the failures of others. In particular, Washington time and again put up with difficult personalities, including Benedict Arnold, who rewarded Washington by spying for Britain. A glaring shortcoming in the book is the absence of maps to follow the various maneuvers of Washington and others. While this book is not without merit in its own right, there is so much more to know about the American Revolutionary period than what the author covers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTL8NQ1CMMSN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451626991#wasThisHelpful","RTL8NQ1CMMSN0","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, having taught thousands of recreational rowers at Harvard, is well versed in what beginning rowers don't know, and thereby need to know, about rowing. This small, easily read book is a good introduction to many facets of rowing and also would be valuable to those who are not absolute beginners. The author is concerned only with sculling, that is, one man, two oars.The book begins by covering the basics of equipment, boat handling, and rowing technique. At each step rowing and equipment terminology is addressed. Later, refinements to basic rowing that permit one to become a true practitioner of the sport are added, including the possibilities of racing. An obscure part of dealing with boats is the setup of the rigging, that is, the apparatus that hold the oars. The author attempts to give some insight, but one suspects that the help of an experienced boat rigger is necessary. Mention of equipment that the rower should bring like what type of clothing for various conditions is not mentioned. Nor are costs associated with rowing detailed. Some mention of injuries would have been good, like what to do about blisters.Unlike some rowing books, this one is not geared towards coaches with obscure chapters on the physics of rowing, details of physiology, and the like. This book is concerned with the practicalities of rowing and its possibilities as an enjoyable activity for almost anyone with such an inclination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PU429SZ279P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1558217096#wasThisHelpful","R19PU429SZ279P","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This meandering, short piece follows the first few years of the author's efforts to learn the practice of rowing at age forty-something. As a classics professor, he was already interested in the military uses of rowing in ancient Greece. He also has the good fortune of living in a city on Cayuga Lake in upstate New York, where rowing is part of the local college community, which includes such infrastructure as boathouses and rowing tanks.The author responds to a ""Learn to Row"" flyer, despite his distinct non-athleticism and older age. As he admits, he is not a natural. It takes him a considerable amount of time to become comfortable with the nuances of rowing in addition to developing the posture and fitness required. The author is also plagued by injuries incurred while rowing, actually necessitating a two-year break from his learning process. While mentioning the risks of rowing, the author does a poor job of explaining the measures that should be taken to prevent drowning when flipping a scull in cold water on a solitary row. People do die every year while rowing.The author is obviously pleased that he found rowing at mid-life, if partly for the reason that it dovetails well with his professional interests. The book leans far too much towards the inspirational side with a lack of attention to practicalities. For example, what clothing is worn throughout the year in different weather conditions? What are the costs for clothing, equipment, club fees, etc? Is rowing really accessible to most people? We do not all live in Ivy League towns on a large lake.The author's personal journey to becoming a rower is mildly interesting though the story is quite hit-and-miss with any number of tangents, including into ancient Greece. The author's personal observations on rowing do not really compensate for the book's several shortcomings. It is hard to say how much help this book would be to a potential rower.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0XPHIUVVOQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684863308#wasThisHelpful","R2T0XPHIUVVOQX","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This manual, consisting of 70 articles by rowing experts and last updated in 1992, produced in association with the US Rowing Association, remains relevant today despite most of the entries being written in the 1970s. The editor is well known in the rowing community as a former rowing coach at an elite Ivy League school. The five sections of the manual are devoted to technique, rigging, training, coxing, and organization.By far the most interesting and developed sections are those on technique and training. The rowing stroke is broken down into minute detail, including its physics. The training articles are correlated with the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems of the body and the energy demands of rowing. Several articles are devoted to rower safety; in particular, what to do if a boat flips over with the threat of hypothermia.The book is pretty much geared to coaches, but would be of interest to anyone with a serious interest in rowing. As usual, in a book with this many articles, there is quite of bit of overlap among the articles with the lack of a consistent thread.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I4RI6M8FKTM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557870861#wasThisHelpful","R2I4RI6M8FKTM2","A1LKSZ9CYJ6829","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKSZ9CYJ6829?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bose Bluetooth Series 2 vs. Sennheiser Presence UC ML vs. Plantronics Voyager Edge vs. Plantronics Voyager Legend UCI began this review after Bose decided to cease production on their Series 2 Bluetooth.  Previous to this review I had been super pleased with the Bose, only complaints were the short battery life (started around 4 hours, and degraded to about 2 hours after a year) and the construction of the item began to falter after about 2 years.Highlights:Plantronics Legend- Comes with a ton of accessories.  Comes with a charging case that doubles as a recharger (too big for your pocket though).  Tells the battery life with each use.  Versatile fit.  Boom microphone should also help voice clarity.  Charging stands for desk.  Auto answers calls, voice recognition. Solidly Built.  Only over the ear Bluetooth I tested.  Was very clear, good volume.Plantronics Edge- Well priced for the quality.  Also has a charging case that doubles as a backup if you run out of juice.  This case uses micro USB.  Lightweight.  The least noticeable on your ear of the four.Bose- Very small.  Very high sound quality. The on/off button is a little flimsy and I have replaces one unit after about 1-2 years.Sennheiser- The boom mike slides in and out to turn on and off. For people that like to turn their devices on and off, this is super easy to use and intuitive.  Nice heavy-duty metal feel.  Great packaging.Cost:1. Plantronics Edge- $50-$602. Plantronics Legend- $1353. Sennheiser UC- $1504. Bose- Sold out- $200+ in aftermarketCase:1.) Both Plantronics cases also hold a charge, which is nice in a bind (be aware that the Edge case will not accommodate the Edge unit if it has the earpiece bar assembled.2.) Sennheiser- Nice, sturdy, high quality, but purposeless case.3.) Bose- I didnât notice or recall a case.Ease of use:1. Bose- Flip switch, put in ear.2. Legend- Flip switch, place over ear, slight adjustment3. Sennheiser- Put over ear, adjust the plastic holder- pull out mike.4. Edge- Place in ear, might have to fidget with the plastic earpiece, as it doesnât go on easy.[This feature is important to me, as I often use my earpiece when driving and I donât like to wear it when not in use, so the ability to pick it up, turn it on, and use it right away is important to me]Comfort:1. Edge- I find this one to be nice and lightweight, fits securely, and once itâs on, you donât notice it.  However **** this one did not stay in my ear without using the plastic around the ear attachment. Without that optional attachment, the Edge would not stay in my ear.2. Bose- Fairly lightweight, and if it fits your ear is nice, if it doesnât fit your ear, you will hate this device.3. Legend is very comfortable, but is also considerably bigger and heavier than the other devices.  If you wear it all the time, would get annoying.  This is however the most versatile fit of all of them.4.) The Sennheiser is a very snug and tight fit, but that can hurt it too, as it sometimes will pinch your face, and getting an optimal fit is not easy.  The rubber coatings are still pretty rough.Battery Life:- This is a tough category, as the Plantronic devices both come with carrying cases that also function as recharging stations, so in essence you can get twice as much life out of a Plantronics.  If you ignore this:1.) Sennheiser- Lasts up to 10 hours, and this seemed accurate.2.) Plantronics- both seemed to get around 6 hours.3.) Bose- this one gets about 4 hours, and then a year later less than two.*  Special note, all three devices other than the Bose announce the battery life.  The Plantronics devices both do it every time the unit is used.  The Sennheiser requires a small button push.  Bose has no feature.Sound Quality: This is a tough category as always. I use mine in the car (road noise) and have a larger head (harder for mike to pick up sounds around my cheeks). Your experience may differ depending on your signal, location, face shape, and usage.1. Bose: By far the most clear. Loud volume. People could hear me. I could hear them.  Most people have never known I was on a Bluetooth.2 (tie). Sennheiser- This one was very loud, no sound distortion2.(tie). Plantronics Legend-  This one also sounds very good, has a nice high volume, and sounds natural.  I didnât get to test this one in as many varying conditions, so gave the nod to the Sennheiser.4. Edge- I didnât like the sound on this one. People could hear my clearly, but they sounded distant and like they were on a speakerphone or in an echo chamber.  Volume was also lower than the other devices.Disappointments:Bose- The on/off button will wear out over time (1-2 years with heavy use).  The battery will also lose effectiveness during this time.  Bose battery life at peak is half of the others (3-4 hours). Can be a tough fit for some ears.Edge- HORRIBLE design if you require using the small plastic ear bar.  If you have this on the device, it will not fit in the charging station.  You will have to take it off every time you want to charge it in the holster.Legend- You cannot charge the unit directly without using a proprietary charging connection (though the case takes micro-usb). It is magnetics, so super easy to use, but if you travel, you need to bring the adapter or the special cord or the case. For business travelers, having to worry about yet another charging method might be an annoyance.Sennheiser-  Pairing can be a little tricky at first.  Putting the unit on and off your ear will take some practice.  Doesnât feel as secure on the ear as the others.Final Conclusions:This one is super hard, as I was hoping that 4 years later the Bose device would have been surpassed. I still think the Bose unit is the best Bluetooth, but the fact that it only holds a charge for 3-4 hours really makes it inferior to the other devices out there right now.  Even though the sound quality is still top notch.I still donât know what unit I am going to keepâ¦..Bose- Bought one of the last new ones before they discontinued it, but I hate the short battery life.Sennheiser- Build quality is great, battery life and sound are great, but the fit is a little uncomfortable.Edge-  Very comfortable, sounds good, but the fact that I canât use the charging station with it makes it annoying.Legend-  Great sound, great charging capabilities, but having the always have a special charger or the charging case on me seems annoying.I hate to say it, but this is my first review ever that will be inconclusiveâ¦.any recommendations???","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3GSJVSL1RJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNO3YHU#wasThisHelpful","R2E3GSJVSL1RJU","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bose Bluetooth Series 2 vs. Sennheiser Presence UC ML vs. Plantronics Voyager Edge vs. Plantronics Voyager Legend UCI began this review after Bose decided to cease production on their Series 2 Bluetooth.  Previous to this review I had been super pleased with the Bose, only complaints were the short battery life (started around 4 hours, and degraded to about 2 hours after a year) and the construction of the item began to falter after about 2 years.Highlights:Plantronics Legend- Comes with a ton of accessories.  Comes with a charging case that doubles as a recharger (too big for your pocket though).  Tells the battery life with each use.  Versatile fit.  Boom microphone should also help voice clarity.  Charging stands for desk.  Auto answers calls, voice recognition. Solidly Built.  Only over the ear Bluetooth I tested.  Was very clear, good volume.Plantronics Edge- Well priced for the quality.  Also has a charging case that doubles as a backup if you run out of juice.  This case uses micro USB.  Lightweight.  The least noticeable on your ear of the four.Bose- Very small.  Very high sound quality. The on/off button is a little flimsy and I have replaces one unit after about 1-2 years.Sennheiser- The boom mike slides in and out to turn on and off. For people that like to turn their devices on and off, this is super easy to use and intuitive.  Nice heavy-duty metal feel.  Great packaging.Cost:1. Plantronics Edge- $50-$602. Plantronics Legend- $1353. Sennheiser UC- $1504. Bose- Sold out- $200+ in aftermarketCase:1.) Both Plantronics cases also hold a charge, which is nice in a bind (be aware that the Edge case will not accommodate the Edge unit if it has the earpiece bar assembled.2.) Sennheiser- Nice, sturdy, high quality, but purposeless case.3.) Bose- I didnât notice or recall a case.Ease of use:1. Bose- Flip switch, put in ear.2. Legend- Flip switch, place over ear, slight adjustment3. Sennheiser- Put over ear, adjust the plastic holder- pull out mike.4. Edge- Place in ear, might have to fidget with the plastic earpiece, as it doesnât go on easy.[This feature is important to me, as I often use my earpiece when driving and I donât like to wear it when not in use, so the ability to pick it up, turn it on, and use it right away is important to me]Comfort:1. Edge- I find this one to be nice and lightweight, fits securely, and once itâs on, you donât notice it.  However **** this one did not stay in my ear without using the plastic around the ear attachment. Without that optional attachment, the Edge would not stay in my ear.2. Bose- Fairly lightweight, and if it fits your ear is nice, if it doesnât fit your ear, you will hate this device.3. Legend is very comfortable, but is also considerably bigger and heavier than the other devices.  If you wear it all the time, would get annoying.  This is however the most versatile fit of all of them.4.) The Sennheiser is a very snug and tight fit, but that can hurt it too, as it sometimes will pinch your face, and getting an optimal fit is not easy.  The rubber coatings are still pretty rough.Battery Life:- This is a tough category, as the Plantronic devices both come with carrying cases that also function as recharging stations, so in essence you can get twice as much life out of a Plantronics.  If you ignore this:1.) Sennheiser- Lasts up to 10 hours, and this seemed accurate.2.) Plantronics- both seemed to get around 6 hours.3.) Bose- this one gets about 4 hours, and then a year later less than two.*  Special note, all three devices other than the Bose announce the battery life.  The Plantronics devices both do it every time the unit is used.  The Sennheiser requires a small button push.  Bose has no feature.Sound Quality: This is a tough category as always. I use mine in the car (road noise) and have a larger head (harder for mike to pick up sounds around my cheeks). Your experience may differ depending on your signal, location, face shape, and usage.1. Bose: By far the most clear. Loud volume. People could hear me. I could hear them.  Most people have never known I was on a Bluetooth.2 (tie). Sennheiser- This one was very loud, no sound distortion2.(tie). Plantronics Legend-  This one also sounds very good, has a nice high volume, and sounds natural.  I didnât get to test this one in as many varying conditions, so gave the nod to the Sennheiser.4. Edge- I didnât like the sound on this one. People could hear my clearly, but they sounded distant and like they were on a speakerphone or in an echo chamber.  Volume was also lower than the other devices.Disappointments:Bose- The on/off button will wear out over time (1-2 years with heavy use).  The battery will also lose effectiveness during this time.  Bose battery life at peak is half of the others (3-4 hours). Can be a tough fit for some ears.Edge- HORRIBLE design if you require using the small plastic ear bar.  If you have this on the device, it will not fit in the charging station.  You will have to take it off every time you want to charge it in the holster.Legend- You cannot charge the unit directly without using a proprietary charging connection (though the case takes micro-usb).

Edge- Place in ear, might have to fidget with the plastic earpiece, as it doesnât go on easy.[This feature is important to me, as I often use my earpiece when driving and I donât like to wear it when not in use, so the ability to pick it up, turn it on, and use it right away is important to me]Comfort:1. Edge- I find this one to be nice and lightweight, fits securely, and once itâs on, you donât notice it.  However **** this one did not stay in my ear without using the plastic around the ear attachment. Without that optional attachment, the Edge would not stay in my ear.2. Bose- Fairly lightweight, and if it fits your ear is nice, if it doesnât fit your ear, you will hate this device.3. Legend is very comfortable, but is also considerably bigger and heavier than the other devices.  If you wear it all the time, would get annoying.  This is however the most versatile fit of all of them.4.) The Sennheiser is a very snug and tight fit, but that can hurt it too, as it sometimes will pinch your face, and getting an optimal fit is not easy.  The rubber coatings are still pretty rough.Battery Life:- This is a tough category, as the Plantronic devices both come with carrying cases that also function as recharging stations, so in essence you can get twice as much life out of a Plantronics.  If you ignore this:1.) Sennheiser- Lasts up to 10 hours, and this seemed accurate.2.) Plantronics- both seemed to get around 6 hours.3.) Bose- this one gets about 4 hours, and then a year later less than two.*  Special note, all three devices other than the Bose announce the battery life.  The Plantronics devices both do it every time the unit is used.  The Sennheiser requires a small button push.  Bose has no feature.Sound Quality: This is a tough category as always. I use mine in the car (road noise) and have a larger head (harder for mike to pick up sounds around my cheeks). Your experience may differ depending on your signal, location, face shape, and usage.1. Bose: By far the most clear. Loud volume. People could hear me. I could hear them.  Most people have never known I was on a Bluetooth.2 (tie). Sennheiser- This one was very loud, no sound distortion2.(tie). Plantronics Legend-  This one also sounds very good, has a nice high volume, and sounds natural.  I didnât get to test this one in as many varying conditions, so gave the nod to the Sennheiser.4. Edge- I didnât like the sound on this one. People could hear my clearly, but they sounded distant and like they were on a speakerphone or in an echo chamber.  Volume was also lower than the other devices.Disappointments:Bose- The on/off button will wear out over time (1-2 years with heavy use).  The battery will also lose effectiveness during this time.  Bose battery life at peak is half of the others (3-4 hours). Can be a tough fit for some ears.Edge- HORRIBLE design if you require using the small plastic ear bar.  If you have this on the device, it will not fit in the charging station.  You will have to take it off every time you want to charge it in the holster.Legend- You cannot charge the unit directly without using a proprietary charging connection (though the case takes micro-usb). It is magnetics, so super easy to use, but if you travel, you need to bring the adapter or the special cord or the case. For business travelers, having to worry about yet another charging method might be an annoyance.Sennheiser-  Pairing can be a little tricky at first.  Putting the unit on and off your ear will take some practice.  Doesnât feel as secure on the ear as the others.Final Conclusions:This one is super hard, as I was hoping that 4 years later the Bose device would have been surpassed. I still think the Bose unit is the best Bluetooth, but the fact that it only holds a charge for 3-4 hours really makes it inferior to the other devices out there right now.  Even though the sound quality is still top notch.I still donât know what unit I am going to keepâ¦..Bose- Bought one of the last new ones before they discontinued it, but I hate the short battery life.Sennheiser- Build quality is great, battery life and sound are great, but the fit is a little uncomfortable.Edge-  Very comfortable, sounds good, but the fact that I canât use the charging station with it makes it annoying.Legend-  Great sound, great charging capabilities, but having the always have a special charger or the charging case on me seems annoying.I hate to say it, but this is my first review ever that will be inconclusiveâ¦.any recommendations???","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7YY8BMTEICQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMBZB3M#wasThisHelpful","RC7YY8BMTEICQ","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bose Bluetooth Series 2 vs. Sennheiser Presence UC ML vs. Plantronics Voyager Edge vs. Plantronics Voyager LegendI began this review after Bose decided to cease production on their Series 2 Bluetooth.  Previous to this review I had been super pleased with the Bose, only complaints were the short battery life (started around 4 hours, and degraded to about 2 hours after a year) and the construction of the item began to falter after about 2 years.Highlights:Plantronics Legend- Comes with a ton of accessories.  Comes with a charging case that doubles as a recharger (too big for your pocket though).  Tells the battery life with each use.  Versatile fit.  Boom microphone should also help voice clarity.  Charging stands for desk.  Auto answers calls, voice recognition. Solidly Built.  Only over the ear Bluetooth I tested.  Was very clear, good volume.Plantronics Edge- Well priced for the quality.  Also has a charging case that doubles as a backup if you run out of juice.  This case uses micro USB.  Lightweight.  The least noticeable on your ear of the four.Bose- Very small.  Very high sound quality. The on/off button is a little flimsy and I have replaces one unit after about 1-2 years.Sennheiser- The boom mike slides in and out to turn on and off. For people that like to turn their devices on and off, this is super easy to use and intuitive.  Nice heavy-duty metal feel.  Great packaging.Cost:1. Plantronics Edge- $50-$602. Plantronics Legend- $1353. Sennheiser UC- $1504. Bose- Sold out- $200+ in aftermarketCase:1.) Both Plantronics cases also hold a charge, which is nice in a bind (be aware that the Edge case will not accommodate the Edge unit if it has the earpiece bar assembled.2.)

"Bose Bluetooth Series 2 vs. Sennheiser Presence UC ML vs. Plantronics Voyager Edge vs. Plantronics Voyager LegendI began this review after Bose decided to cease production on their Series 2 Bluetooth.  Previous to this review I had been super pleased with the Bose, only complaints were the short battery life (started around 4 hours, and degraded to about 2 hours after a year) and the construction of the item began to falter after about 2 years.Highlights:Plantronics Legend- Comes with a ton of accessories.  Comes with a charging case that doubles as a recharger (too big for your pocket though).  Tells the battery life with each use.  Versatile fit.  Boom microphone should also help voice clarity.  Charging stands for desk.  Auto answers calls, voice recognition. Solidly Built.  Only over the ear Bluetooth I tested.  Was very clear, good volume.Plantronics Edge- Well priced for the quality.  Also has a charging case that doubles as a backup if you run out of juice.  This case uses micro USB.  Lightweight.  The least noticeable on your ear of the four.Bose- Very small.  Very high sound quality. The on/off button is a little flimsy and I have replaces one unit after about 1-2 years.Sennheiser- The boom mike slides in and out to turn on and off. For people that like to turn their devices on and off, this is super easy to use and intuitive.  Nice heavy-duty metal feel.  Great packaging.Cost:1. Plantronics Edge- $50-$602. Plantronics Legend- $1353. Sennheiser UC- $1504. Bose- Sold out- $200+ in aftermarketCase:1.) Both Plantronics cases also hold a charge, which is nice in a bind (be aware that the Edge case will not accommodate the Edge unit if it has the earpiece bar assembled.2.) Sennheiser- Nice, sturdy, high quality, but purposeless case.3.) Bose- I didnât notice or recall a case.Ease of use:1. Bose- Flip switch, put in ear.2. Legend- Flip switch, place over ear, slight adjustment3. Sennheiser- Put over ear, adjust the plastic holder- pull out mike.4. Edge- Place in ear, might have to fidget with the plastic earpiece, as it doesnât go on easy.[This feature is important to me, as I often use my earpiece when driving and I donât like to wear it when not in use, so the ability to pick it up, turn it on, and use it right away is important to me]Comfort:1. Edge- I find this one to be nice and lightweight, fits securely, and once itâs on, you donât notice it.  However **** this one did not stay in my ear without using the plastic around the ear attachment. Without that optional attachment, the Edge would not stay in my ear.2. Bose- Fairly lightweight, and if it fits your ear is nice, if it doesnât fit your ear, you will hate this device.3. Legend is very comfortable, but is also considerably bigger and heavier than the other devices.  If you wear it all the time, would get annoying.  This is however the most versatile fit of all of them.4.) The Sennheiser is a very snug and tight fit, but that can hurt it too, as it sometimes will pinch your face, and getting an optimal fit is not easy.  The rubber coatings are still pretty rough.Battery Life:- This is a tough category, as the Plantronic devices both come with carrying cases that also function as recharging stations, so in essence you can get twice as much life out of a Plantronics.  If you ignore this:1.) Sennheiser- Lasts up to 10 hours, and this seemed accurate.2.) Plantronics- both seemed to get around 6 hours.3.) Bose- this one gets about 4 hours, and then a year later less than two.*  Special note, all three devices other than the Bose announce the battery life.  The Plantronics devices both do it every time the unit is used.  The Sennheiser requires a small button push.  Bose has no feature.Sound Quality: This is a tough category as always. I use mine in the car (road noise) and have a larger head (harder for mike to pick up sounds around my cheeks). Your experience may differ depending on your signal, location, face shape, and usage.1. Bose: By far the most clear. Loud volume. People could hear me. I could hear them.  Most people have never known I was on a Bluetooth.2 (tie). Sennheiser- This one was very loud, no sound distortion2.(tie). Plantronics Legend-  This one also sounds very good, has a nice high volume, and sounds natural.  I didnât get to test this one in as many varying conditions, so gave the nod to the Sennheiser.4. Edge- I didnât like the sound on this one. People could hear my clearly, but they sounded distant and like they were on a speakerphone or in an echo chamber.  Volume was also lower than the other devices.Disappointments:Bose- The on/off button will wear out over time (1-2 years with heavy use).  The battery will also lose effectiveness during this time.  Bose battery life at peak is half of the others (3-4 hours). Can be a tough fit for some ears.Edge- HORRIBLE design if you require using the small plastic ear bar.  If you have this on the device, it will not fit in the charging station.  You will have to take it off every time you want to charge it in the holster.Legend- You cannot charge the unit directly without using a proprietary charging connection (though the case takes micro-usb). It is magnetics, so super easy to use, but if you travel, you need to bring the adapter or the special cord or the case. For business travelers, having to worry about yet another charging method might be an annoyance.Sennheiser-  Pairing can be a little tricky at first.  Putting the unit on and off your ear will take some practice.  Doesnât feel as secure on the ear as the others.Final Conclusions:This one is super hard, as I was hoping that 4 years later the Bose device would have been surpassed.

Edge- I find this one to be nice and lightweight, fits securely, and once itâs on, you donât notice it.  However **** this one did not stay in my ear without using the plastic around the ear attachment. Without that optional attachment, the Edge would not stay in my ear.2. Bose- Fairly lightweight, and if it fits your ear is nice, if it doesnât fit your ear, you will hate this device.3. Legend is very comfortable, but is also considerably bigger and heavier than the other devices.  If you wear it all the time, would get annoying.  This is however the most versatile fit of all of them.4.) The Sennheiser is a very snug and tight fit, but that can hurt it too, as it sometimes will pinch your face, and getting an optimal fit is not easy.  The rubber coatings are still pretty rough.Battery Life:- This is a tough category, as the Plantronic devices both come with carrying cases that also function as recharging stations, so in essence you can get twice as much life out of a Plantronics.  If you ignore this:1.) Sennheiser- Lasts up to 10 hours, and this seemed accurate.2.) Plantronics- both seemed to get around 6 hours.3.) Bose- this one gets about 4 hours, and then a year later less than two.*  Special note, all three devices other than the Bose announce the battery life.  The Plantronics devices both do it every time the unit is used.  The Sennheiser requires a small button push.  Bose has no feature.Sound Quality: This is a tough category as always. I use mine in the car (road noise) and have a larger head (harder for mike to pick up sounds around my cheeks). Your experience may differ depending on your signal, location, face shape, and usage.1. Bose: By far the most clear. Loud volume. People could hear me. I could hear them.  Most people have never known I was on a Bluetooth.2 (tie). Sennheiser- This one was very loud, no sound distortion2.(tie). Plantronics Legend-  This one also sounds very good, has a nice high volume, and sounds natural.  I didnât get to test this one in as many varying conditions, so gave the nod to the Sennheiser.4. Edge- I didnât like the sound on this one. People could hear my clearly, but they sounded distant and like they were on a speakerphone or in an echo chamber.  Volume was also lower than the other devices.Disappointments:Bose- The on/off button will wear out over time (1-2 years with heavy use).  The battery will also lose effectiveness during this time.  Bose battery life at peak is half of the others (3-4 hours). Can be a tough fit for some ears.Edge- HORRIBLE design if you require using the small plastic ear bar.  If you have this on the device, it will not fit in the charging station.  You will have to take it off every time you want to charge it in the holster.Legend- You cannot charge the unit directly without using a proprietary charging connection (though the case takes micro-usb). It is magnetics, so super easy to use, but if you travel, you need to bring the adapter or the special cord or the case. For business travelers, having to worry about yet another charging method might be an annoyance.Sennheiser-  Pairing can be a little tricky at first.  Putting the unit on and off your ear will take some practice.  Doesnât feel as secure on the ear as the others.Final Conclusions:This one is super hard, as I was hoping that 4 years later the Bose device would have been surpassed. I still think the Bose unit is the best Bluetooth, but the fact that it only holds a charge for 3-4 hours really makes it inferior to the other devices out there right now.  Even though the sound quality is still top notch.I still donât know what unit I am going to keepâ¦..Bose- Bought one of the last new ones before they discontinued it, but I hate the short battery life.Sennheiser- Build quality is great, battery life and sound are great, but the fit is a little uncomfortable.Edge-  Very comfortable, sounds good, but the fact that I canât use the charging station with it makes it annoying.Legend-  Great sound, great charging capabilities, but having the always have a special charger or the charging case on me seems annoying.I hate to say it, but this is my first review ever that will be inconclusiveâ¦.any recommendations???","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHOC9YI7C7QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3CFRMK#wasThisHelpful","R1WHOC9YI7C7QG","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the story of a young, libertine lady and her short life as a stripper.  She is a very free-spirited lass, and while her boyfriend continues to disappoint, she constantly is finding ways to earn them food or money.  She finally settles on stripping, and her tales are enjoyable.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is the continuation of the Melody comic book series from the mid-80s.  Granted this series, the artwork is pretty elementary, and while adult in nature, you won't find it very titillating.  You will however enjoy the further adventure of Melody and Nick. Melody wrote and drew this, and it is pretty evident.  However, I did find her unique drawing perspectives refreshing and fun.It's a great read, very enjoyable, and it will have you tracking down the older issues from Kitchen Sink.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DFATBVE3PMR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770462007#wasThisHelpful","R3DFATBVE3PMR2","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, this is still probably the most iconic card in magic, and some would argue an auto include in every deck, but that's simply not true anymore.

Keeps them all aligned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBN39WO80WPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AF8237K#wasThisHelpful","R1IBN39WO80WPH","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best sleeves on the market. Occasionally you will get one or two that don't work or are cut a little too tight, but that is very rare.

"This piece is about as nice as you would expect.  Pretty solid, worth the price.  I would say slightly lower than Ikea quality, but easy to put together and well priced.Pros:All the tools and screws came with it (none missing)Directions were pretty clear.  If you can put together Ikea, this is easier.Took about an hour to an hour and a half.You can put this together solo, but if you have a second person towards the end will be a little easier.Cons:Most of the pieces are marked, but not all.  Might make it slightly easier.Center piece bowed a little.The strap to hold down the infant seems way too short.No security strap to hold this against a wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSW4O2IBLJSMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OSHTSO#wasThisHelpful","RSW4O2IBLJSMW","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bose QC25 vs. Bose QC15 vs. Beats Studio (by Dre.) vs. Sennheiser PXC 450 vs. Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7bDisclosure: I have tried all these on an airplane. I am not an audiophile. Noise Cancelation is the most important attribute to me.The Carrying Case: All four are quite durable and stiff.1.) Bose QC25- Very small, compact, and just big enough.  Does not really have room for anything else.  Could fit in a briefcase.2.) Bose- QC15- This case is bigger than the QC25 (Which could be a good thing.  Doesn't feel much bigger, and still has room for ipod, Gameboy, batteries, whatever).3.) Sennheiser- Square shape, low profile, however not a lot of room for anything else in case.4.) Audio Technica- Nice big case if you want to carry extra stuff (Nintendo DS, ipod, etc).5.) Beat case is very elegant and hip, but very wide and skinny.  Maybe room for an ipod and that's about it.  Caribbeaner Clasp.Build Quality:1.) Sennheiser- you can tell this is built VERY well. Strong plastics, good components, thick cord. Top notch. You feel like you are getting something really high quality.2.) Beats appears to be extremely well made.  Heavy duty industrial plastics, metal fasteners.  High end box, thick cord, great packaging, solid construction. Only concern of mine is that the battery compartment seems a little fragile.3.) Bose25 is a step up here from the 15.  Detachable cord.  A little more substantial feeling.  Touches of aluminum on the headphones, and some nicer quality padding.  While not as substantial at the Sennheiser, they do feel more luxurious and a little more solidly built than the QC15.4.) Audio Technica- Nice solid construction, appears durable.  Mostly heavy duty plastic.5.) Bose15- If this had a Sanyo logo on the side, I would not have flinched. How can something $300 be so incredibly cheaply made.Size:1.) Bose25- A step up from the Bose15.  A little more sleek.  Not as dorky looking. Fold flat.2.) Beats- These are a little bigger than the others, but that are also meant to stand out and be seen. Probably the hippest looking, but a little bold for business users.3.) Bose15- as far as over the ears go, these are pretty small.4.) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.5.) Sennheiser- These are big. No question, but they store flat.Comfort:1.) Sennheiser- Very comfortable, will fit almost any size ears. Keep on for hours.2.) Bose25- A stepup here.  More comfortable than QC15, more flex, better padding.  Less hot.  Could be tight around some larger ears.  Can press a little tight after some time, so test them.  After a few hours, my ears hurt from the pressing, but some adjustments can be made.3.) Beats seemed to be a little tight on my head and I didn't see a way to make them less ""compressy.""  I don't think I (personally) would like to wear these all day.  Too pinchy for my head.  The earphone part is also a little small for me.  These became hot and uncomfortable after time for me.4.) Bose15- Also comfortable. I did not experience ""highs"" discomfort.5.) Audio-Technica- Perfectly satisfactory. Larger opening than previous AT model. Gets warm and tight on head on long flights.Sound:Disclaimer.  This is a tough category, as they all had very different sounds and need to be used personally.  The Sennheisers helped me hear parts of songs I had never heard before, but so did the Beats (baselines were much stronger).1.) Sennheiser- I actually wore these at home too, simply to hear parts of songs I had never heard before. Astounding. My 10yr old music collection sounded totally NEW.2.) Bose25- A step up from the QC15.  Music more evenly balanced.  Bass is hard hitting, but not as annoying as in the QC15.  Some break-in is required.  A more 3D sound than QC15.  The QC25 closes the Sennheiser gap much more than the QC15.  Be aware, some mp3s might feel a little flat.2.) I put the Bose25 and Beats in the same category.  The Bose seemed more evenly balanced.  The Beats sounded great, but were EXTREMELY bass heavy.  You will hear complexity of base lines that you never noticed. Drums tracks will sound like drums, bass guitar will be noticed for the first time on songs, but the highs are VERY weak. Pop music will sound very muted, rap and hip hop will pop and you'll feel like you have a Kicker Bass speaker in your car.  I can't compare Beats to the others.  It's a totally different sound which you will either love or hate.3.) Audio-Technica- Well balanced, good sound.4.) Bose15- Great clear sound, but very heavy on the bass. I listen to a lot of rap and pop, so it was mildly annoying. I ultimately had to turn my treble settings up on my ipod to balance the sound.Features:1.) Beats- Great packaging.  Two cords with different connectors.  Nice Case.  Cloth.  They do a good job of making you think you bought a nice product (and it is).  Only concern is the headphones don't work without batteries.  The headphone creates a pseudo noise cancellation.2.) Bose25- Nice new case.  Removeable cord (so it won't rip out if you jerk it accidently).  Passive headphone (if battery dies, headphone still works - albeit without noise cancelation).  Choice of white color.3.) Sennheiser- nice cord, push to talk button (temporarily mutes NC and sound which is great for interruptions on airplanes).4.) Bose/Audio Technica- just the basics. Bose simply an on/off switch.Price:1.) Audio Technica- $125 depending on how you shop.2.) Beats Studio- $175-$2003.) Bose QC15- $200-$2504.) Bose QC25- $300 (hard to find discounted)5.) Sennheiser- $200 to $400 (how are these going up in price- 5 yrs later)Noise Cancelation:1.) Bose- No question here, far surpassed the other two. Best Noise Cancelation.  I did not notice a significant change in QC15- to QC25 on planes, however did notice a little difference in office.2.) Audio-Technica- Good Noise Cancelation.3.) Sennheiser- Not sure what happened here. Incredible sound, less than satisfactory noise cancelation.4.) I don't think the Beats are official noise cancellation, but the headphone part is great at isolating outdoor noise, and they are very tight on the head.  When you put them on without music, they offer decent noise cancellation.Summary:Please understand, noise cancellation will not drown out a crying baby, slamming doors, or people talking.  They will help out with repetitive noises like airplanes, air-conditioners or soft noises.  If you don't listen to music, these might isolate sounds even more and be counter-productive.The QC25 are a nice step up from the QC15.  I do not feel they are overwhelmingly better or worth an upgrade if you were happy with QC15 (but some people like the latest and greatest).  If I were buying new and the price difference was only $50, go for the QC25, if you have QC15 and you like them, it's not a huge jump (or buy them and return if you don't like).  The QC25 sound a little better, are better built, and a little more convenient.  But not sure they are 5 years of R&D better.  If the difference in price is >$100, QC15 looks more attractive.Audio Technica and Sennheiser don't seem to have any new offerings either, so this segment has been kind of stagnant.  I will say that Bose seems to have listened and addressed most of the complaints of the QC15.  They've improved the size, sound, build quality, and maintained their quality Noise Cancelation.The Sennheiser Noise Cancellation is a real disappointment.  Great headphone, horrible noise cancelation headphone.  The Audio Technica is a great entry price point-value item.The Beats are kind of their own product with their own demographic.  Like the Sennheisers, they made me hear parts of songs I had never heard before, but on the bass side.  If you like heavy, heavy bass, go for the beats.Final assessment:Audio-Technica- best balance of value for moneySennheiser- Best sound and comfortBose- By far Best Noise Cancelation.Beats- Best for bass.  More of a hip hop bass then the Bose though.I use these for airplane travel only, so I ended up keeping the Bose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XCIKO4IQX1N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1NEUKK#wasThisHelpful","R2XCIKO4IQX1N6","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everki Concept vs. Ogio Renegade RSS vs. Thule 32L Vs. Ogio EpicEverki Concept vs. Ogio Renegade RSS vs. Thule 32L Vs. Ogio EpicSo I am super particular about certain things (read my other revises if you donât believe me). I spent a few years looking for the perfect travelers backpack. I tried everything from Burton to Dakine and loved my Dakine, but it was getting a little long in tooth. Iâve tried all three of these with the sole purpose of finding the best backpack for international travel (pleasure). I usually go on long trips, but have to work while on vacation.I travel with: Nikon DSLR and 18-300 lens. 14â laptop. Ipad. Chargers. First Aid kit, and small ancillary things (sanitizers, baby powder, adaptors, etc).Price:1.) Ogio Renegade and Epic available at ~$1002.) Thule at REI for $1293.) Everki is $200Construction:1.) Everki is so far beyond these other two itâs not even funny. Big HIGH QUALITY zippers. High Quality construction. Felt lined pockets. Leather accents. Comfortable straps.2.) Ogio Renegade is only slightly better than the Thule. The Thule seemed a little too low profile, sleep, and was a stiff material. Ogio zippers were disappointing. I donât think they will last forever.3.) Thule was a little stiff, basic construction, wasnât super impressed.4.)  The Ogio Epicâs zippers are pretty weak, and the fabric is a little stiff.  Construction is more like outlet versus store quality.Special Features:1.) Ogio Renegade has tons of pockets. Two sunglass pockets on front which is great because you can put your wallet or phone in a separate container from your sunglasses. 4 side pockets. Super slim felt lined computer pocket (I am not convinced a 17â would fit in here). And a great front ipad pocket. Even a secret pocket on straps2.)  The Ogio Epic has less side pockets, but has some more interesting uses.  It has an AMAZING external ipad pocket which is great for airplanes.  Itâs pockets are also laid out better, easier to get into, and more functional.  The side laptop pocket is nice, but I had to deduct a point because the side pocket is not suspended.  If you drop your bag hard, your laptop will suffer. And although it had three mini pockets on the top, none of them were hard shell.3.) Everki has a lay flat system which is AWESOME for going through airport scanners. You donât need to remove your laptop. Computer and Ipad pockets are super padded and well lined (though computer pocket does not suspend computer, which might be a concern if you drop your backpack down a lot. Everki has a giant sunglass case and also a nice large open pocket on the front (good for airplane tickers, or wallet or passport. Though it is NOT secure). Magnetically sealed. It also has a waterproof cover that comes out of the bottom pocket. I donât see myself using this.4.) Thule has a âshove it pocketâ in the front which is great for newspaper, magazine, or a lunch bag. It is not secure enough for anything else, as the sides are open too. This feature is interesting, but I donât think that useable. Good, hard protected pocket on front for sunglasses, phone etc. Has a nice bottom pocket for chargers, etc.Comfort:1.) The Everki is big, very big, and a little heavy. (4.5 lbs). But is very comfortable to wear. Super nice straps. High quality, comfortable construction. I could wear this all day.2.) Ogio Renegade and Thule are very behind in this department. Thule is very basic straps with stiff construction. The kind of straps you would find on a $30 backpack. The Ogio is the same, which very short straps, that will not fit a larger man unless fully extended. Not super comfortable. Thule is much lighter than the other two. Ogio is about 4 lbs, but also very stiff.  The backpack has almost TOO MUCH padding.3.)  The Ogio Epic is pretty stiff and the straps are a little stiff too.Profile:1.)  The Epic is a nice size.  Deceptively big, but the parts that arenât used seem to compress.  This backpack seems much smaller than it is.  I put a ton in here.2.) Thule is low profile, very thin, with deep pockets.3.) Ogio Renegade is also pretty stiff and will easily fit under plane seat.4.) Everki is bigger than these other two, but also a little bulkier. I think this backpack would be amazing in a 15â size, as the 17â is almost TOO accommodating.Pockets:1.) Ogio Renegade has pockets everywhere, and they are well thought out pockets. As I said, dual wallet pockets on the front. Four side pockets. Ipad pocket in front, and even a cash pocket on the straps. Computer case is very hidden, which is great, as you donât need it very often. Ipad is easily accessed. Laptop pocket is well protected and also suspended.2.)  The Epic has a ton of pockets (LOVE THE IPAD POCKET), but as said before, only a few detractors:  Only two side pockets, which are also pretty small.  Laptop pocket is not suspended.  And there is no hard shell pocket.3.) Everki has some amazing pockets, but they are not well thought out. The laptop pocket is massive, padded, felt lined, but also does not suspend. The ipad pocket is also located in the same pocket, which is kind of a pain. That means you have to open up your laptop pocket, which is in the rear, every time you want to access ipad. Front pocket is too narrow to be useful. Sunglass pocket is large, but only one. BIG MISTAKE: NO SIDE POCKETS. There are two, but they are not very useable, and non seal. Magnetic pocket one front is helpful, but obviously not secure. Bottom pocket holds the waterproof cover, but not very useful and makes the bag unstable.4.) Thule has a good hard shell pocket. Other pockets are very deep and narrow. Stuff it pocket is okay, but not secure enough to hold anything other than newspaper or magazine.Straps:1.) Everki- home run2.) Thule/Ogio- tied for last. Both are what you would expect on a $30 backpack. Stiff back. Not comfortable. Ogio straps are VERY VERY short and the adjustment does not hold. This is great if you are 6â, if not, beware.Zippers:1.) Everki- amazing zippers. Will last forever.2.) Thule- acceptable3.) Ogio- total junk. I do not expect this backpack to last me more than 1-2 years.Looks;1.) Everki- you could walk into a board meeting with this bag.2.) Ogio Epic- very nice, very subtle.  Itâs not nearly as boxy as the photos look.  3.) Ogio Renegade- very sporty. Not businesslike.4.) Thule- distinctive, but very sporty too.Warranty:1.) Everki has a lifetime warranty, no questions asked. This combined with their EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY makes them a force to be reckoned with.2.) Thule claims to have a 25yr warranty, but I am not sure the details.3.) Ogio has a limited lifetime warranty, but we all know how valuable those are. Construction on this piece is a little suspect, so we'll see how it goes.In conclusion, I immediately dismissed the Thule. It was a little too thin, and didnât really offer anything extra other than the bottom pocket. I kept the Everki for one trip and was in love with it, but couldnât get past a few things. The lack of exterior side pockets was a pain. The bag was also very big. I travel with a 13-14â laptop, so I didnât need a bag as big as the Everki. Sometimes it was tight in an airplane. The construction of the bag was awesome, but the rear computer pocket was tough to get into, and I wish it wasnât also shared by the ipad pocket. Ipads needs to be immediately accessible. Front pocket was worthless. The middle pocket however is huge. And I LOVED LOVED LOVED the construction of the bag, the quality of the bag, and the giant zippers. If I were using this for business, it is also very professional looking.For awhile, I liked the Ogio Renegade. I hate the zippers on it, but I like the small, enclosed laptop pocket. I love the dual sunglass pocket (can be uses for phone and wallet too), and I like the side pockets. I love the ipad pocket on the front. I hate the straps and stiff feel of the rear, but couldnât get past the weight and the excessive padding.I ended up keeping the Ogio Epic for a few reasons.  It didnât seem as big and bulky.  The pockets are very well laid out.  The side pocket is nice for the laptop, and the external slide in ipad pocket will be a godsend for planes, etc.  Itâs a little big lighter too.  I will miss the hard shell sunglass pocket, but it has three others that are nice.  This bag is deceptively big.  I worry about the build quality, but weâll see!!If I could get the Ogio bag with the Everki construction, I would buy 3-4 of them and use forever.Final Pro/Con on Ogio Epic:PROS: Best design. Best pockets. Best layouts. Best size for me.CONS: Shoddy construction. Mediocre zippers. Stiff/bucky padding. Bad straps. Heavy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227Z52ET5R9IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HY6C8M#wasThisHelpful","R227Z52ET5R9IH","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I were using this for business, it is also very professional looking.For awhile, I liked the Ogio Renegade. I hate the zippers on it, but I like the small, enclosed laptop pocket. I love the dual sunglass pocket (can be uses for phone and wallet too), and I like the side pockets. I love the ipad pocket on the front. I hate the straps and stiff feel of the rear, but couldnât get past the weight and the excessive padding.I ended up keeping the Ogio Epic for a few reasons.  It didnât seem as big and bulky.  The pockets are very well laid out.  The side pocket is nice for the laptop, and the external slide in ipad pocket will be a godsend for planes, etc.  Itâs a little big lighter too.  I will miss the hard shell sunglass pocket, but it has three others that are nice.  This bag is deceptively big.  I worry about the build quality, but weâll see!!If I could get the Ogio bag with the Everki construction, I would buy 3-4 of them and use forever.Final Pro/Con on Ogio Epic:PROS: Best design. Best pockets. Best layouts. Best size for me.CONS: Shoddy construction. Mediocre zippers. Stiff.. Bad straps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYZQI7TGYBZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EYU5TM#wasThisHelpful","R2RYZQI7TGYBZR","A2QDYGI5OETYV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDYGI5OETYV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vitamix 5200 vs. Blendtec Signature Series Blender (with wildside and twister jar)How they compare and rank for me:Prices (at time):1.) Blendtec is about $275 during hot promotions (Kohls) for blender and two jars.2.) Vitamix is about $300 for refurbished, $375 for new (one jar).Value:1.) Blendtec is cheaper, has a better warranty and includes two jars.2.) Vitamix is one jar only.Size:1.) Blendtec is much smaller, takes up less space. Fits under cabinet.2.) Vitamix is massive and almost seems 50% bigger- but also a little more substantial.Power:1.) Both seemed to have similar power.Features:1.) The Blentec had programmable features, which was nice to be able to step away from machine.2.) Vitamix features a damper, which was nice when the contents stick.Jars:1.) Blendtec wildside jar is significantly better. Is pours easier, fits under cabinets and easier to clean (plus no sharp edges). I rarely used the twister jar- which seems small for the tasks it is needed.2.) Vitamix jar has a nice rubber handle and solid feel to it. Feels heavy and substantial. However, product tends to get stuck underneath blades.Looks:1.) I think the Blendtec is smaller, more subtle, and more attractive.2.) If you want the blender to be the focal point of your kitchen, go with the Vitamix. It looks more industrial, but is also pretty plain. It's very big.Cleaning:One thing to note, neither of these will ever look nearly as good as the day you buy it. For some reason, the plastic canisters fog up, and never really get truly clean. That said:1.) Blendtec canister is a lot easier to clean, particles just fall out the bottom.2.) Vitamix- due to the blades in the bottom, a decent amount of food often gets stuck below the blade. You have to rinse or remove it to clean.Prep:1.) Blendtec does not have the damper/tamper (whatever), which makes adding ingredients a TON easier. You just lift off the top. That said, when the blender does stick, you can't move the ingredients around.2.) Vitamix- Tamper is a nice feature, but adding a smidgeon of something after you begin to blend is actually a pain.Smoothies:Let me get one thing straight, neither of these will be able to mash anything. Both seemed to struggle with frozen fruit, or smoothies that are liquid light. Both of them ""stalled"" at times. Not sure if it is because I was using almond mill/hemp milk, or because I just don't always add enough. Either way, you do need to use some level of chemistry with BOTH of these.1.) The Vitamix, however, seems to do better without proper measured ingredients. You can throw in some milk, ice, fruit, spices, and generally it will work (PRO TIP: make sure to lift up damper during mix, or it won't create a mixing vortex and will stall).2.) The Blendtec works just as well, but is a little more finicky with improper ratios. It will stall out, and without a damper, is hard to get going again.Noise:1.) The Vitamix was very loud, but noticeably less loud than the blendtec.2.) The Blendtec screams. It's amazing how loud these are.Realistically, I will mostly use this thing for smoothies and milkshakes. Yes you can make balsamic vinegar, or an avocado ice cream, or even peanut butter, but I don't think I'll really ever do that. I wanted to like the Blendtec. Hell, I even bought one first when the wife was asking for a Vitamix, because I assumed it was cheaper and came with more. You won't go wrong with either one, and I've heard Blendtec is better for soups and programmable features. All I cared about was smoothies, and the Viatmix seemed to handle a mix of random ingredients better than the Blendtec.Final results:Blendtec-Pros: easier to clean, better pour, programmable features, smaller shelf footprint, value, warranty. Digital.Cons: Noisy, stalls on milkshakes on occasion, no blades.Vitamix:Pros: Easier smoothies, substantial feel, damper, blades, SLIGHTLY quieter.Cons: blades, bad pouring, jammed ingredients, no programsI ended up keeping the Vitamix. For my uses, it just seems a little easier. Can't go wrong with either one, and each side has usually already come to their own conclusions. It's like debating Apple vs. Microsoft.

"Twice now I've purchased cheap versions ($25-30) of this type of bag from other manufacturers - one Chinese, one Italian. Both looked very nice new, both disintegrated in just under a year. The back straps ripped off one, the lining separated from the leather in another, and both were made from very thin leather that looked very shabby 10 months later.Buying a well-made $90 bag that lasts for many years is a lot cheaper than buying a $25 bag that has to be replaced every 10 or 11 months. So when the second bag fell apart, I bought a Le Donne bag.I chose this particular Le Donne bag because it has lots of separate compartments - including (notably) one in the back (next to my body) where I can put things like my metro card (I live in NYC) that I need to find quickly, but is valuable and don't want to be easily accessible to someone walking behind me and opening a zipper. No one has ever done that to me in NYC, but I've heard of it happening to other people. If I was traveling, I'd put my passport in that pocket next to my body. I like the pockets on the sides and bottom to give quick access to things - lip gloss, tissues, etc. There's also a zipped pocket on the inside of the main bag.It's just the right size for me. It's a moderate size handbag - big enough to hold what I need to carry (including my Kindle), but not gigantic. It looks very well made. The back straps are thick at the top and padded. You adjust the length of the straps with a notched buckle, not one of those sliding buckles that tends to slip. The stitching for the straps is heavily reinforced on top - it's not coming out. The leather is thick and soft - good quality. The hardware is good quality, too - doesn't look chintzy. The grommets look strong.I've had it for a month and so far so good, but really I need to report back in a year. I paid more for a quality bag that will last. Let's see if it does!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQUZH6QGABHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NJY1VS#wasThisHelpful","R1KQUZH6QGABHI","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks to be a very well-made umbrella. It hasn't rained since it arrived, so I can't verify that the material is waterproof (I've read reviews of umbrellas where that's an issue), but hopefully it is. It's 40"" across the bottom when open - measuring the diameter of the open circle, rather than the length across the curved top. That's slightly bigger than the average diameter of 37-38"". The 16 ribs should make it much stronger in high winds than umbrellas with the usual 8 ribs - though, as I said, I haven't had an opportunity to test it in rain yet.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that the foam handle has a big scrape in it, which is annoying and disappointing.

"These are easy to put on and generally comfortable except for the little toe, which is extremely overstretched and the reason I'm returning them. There is nothing at all wrong with my little toe, and in fact I can actively move it out very far on its own. I think the design of YogaToes Gems is defective. There is no difference at all in the thickness or spacing of the separators for the smaller toes - there is the larger big toe separator, then all the rest are the same. But not all the rest of one's toes are the same. You can see in the picture for the product that the small toe is overstretched, and I'm sure that the model's foot is bigger than mine (mine is size 8 women's US).So I'm returning these, and though they cost a lot more, I'm going to buy Correct Toes.

"10 Dec 2014: This is an update of my original review, which is below. I have revised my rating from 3-stars to 5-stars. Here's why.At the time I wrote my original review, I had just had a Lapidus bunionectomy on my right foot and was still no-weight-bearing (NWB). My left foot was 5 months post-op Lapidus bunionectomy. During the NWB period on my right foot, when my left foot was doing all the work, my left big toe did what I said I was afraid it would do in my original review - it started to drift towards my small toes again. When I noticed my toe seemed to be angling in again, I asked my doctor to x-ray my left foot when I came in for a check of my right foot, and you could see it in x-ray - an approximately 3mm shift out of alignment. I'd been taping my foot and not wearing the splint.After 5 months of post-op hell on this left foot, there was no way I was going get another bunion, so rather than return the splint, which I was all ready to do (I'd already packed it up), I decided to use it. Since it fits inside no shoes and gets filthy fast if I walk around barefoot, I wear it with a surgical shoe. For the next 3 weeks, I wore the splint almost constantly unless I was wearing shoes. I wear it around my apartment, and I wear it when I'm sleeping. When I go out (i.e. when I wear shoes), I use my custom orthotics so my hypermobile foot has proper support. I also have been using a home ultrasound machine, and after the ultrasound treatment when my foot is warmed up, I stretch that big toe back in the other direction. It started to look a lot better. Yesterday, I had another check of my right foot and asked my doctor to again x-ray my left foot. And... THE BIG TOE ON MY LEFT FOOT IS STRAIGHT AGAIN, back in joint.So this thing does work. I moved my own bones and have the x-rays to prove it. I'm now using the splint as a sort of ""retainer"" (like the retainers the orthodontist gives you after braces). And I bought one for my right foot. :)5-STARS!!!!! *****---------------------------------------------------------------Many reviewers said this product caused them pain. I'm pretty sure I know why. If you use it according to the directions, you will pull your big toe out of joint alignment, and that's going to hurt. More on this below, but first some context.I am trying this product after major bunion surgery to maintain the correction while my foot strengthens and heals. For those familiar with bunionectomy procedures, I had the big bad gruesome one on both feet: Lapidus. The right foot surgery was very recent, left foot about 5 months ago. I have hypermobile feet and my bunions were severe. The Lapidus procedure straightens then fuses the joint at the base of the first metatarsal, but the rest of my foot remains hypermobile. Also, because I had such severe bunions for so many years, I have atrophy in the adductor muscle in my big toe.Try this experiment. Put your finger on the outside of your big toe, and try to push your toe against your finger, so your big toe is spreading out from your foot towards the center of your body. Can you do it? If so, congratulations! You have a healthy adductor hallucis muscle. Sadly, I cannot do this - or rather, I can barely do this. I like to think there is trace movement, though I'm not really sure there is.Because of my foot's hypermobility and the loss of adductor strength, my stupid freaking big toe wanders in (my physical therapist insists this is ""out"" because it's away from the center of my body, but I say it's ""in"" because it's towards my small toes). Anyway, you get the picture. After 5 months of painful and difficult recovery from Lapidus surgery (5.5 weeks no weight bearing!), it's really annoying!! It's important that I keep my toe in correct alignment while I build up strength in my foot - not only to avoid future surgeries, but because my foot starts to hurt when the joint is not aligned.I originally solved this problem with a simple and effective method I devised of taping the toe with Kinesio tape. But then I had to have a second surgery on the same foot because of scar tissue adhesions, and the incision couldn't properly heal when I was taping it all the time. So I looked for an alternative to taping and found this splint.I've learned more about feet than I ever expected to know because of these surgeries, and I know where the proper alignment of my big toe joint is. So one of the first things I noticed about this splint is that if you follow the instructions, you will pull the big toe joint out of alignment - over-correct in the other direction - and that's going to hurt. There is a 1/8"" gel cushion that starts at mid foot and ends at the big toe joint. The aligned position of my toe is where it would be if the gel cushion extended all the way up the splint. So unless I want to pull my toe out of joint, I have to leave about a 1/8"" space between the outer edge of my big toe and the splint. Maybe this is something unique about the structure of my foot, but it seems like a design flaw.Also, FYI, this thing fits inside NO shoes. I tried it in crocs and my biggest bedroom slippers. Even the crocs didn't work because all that stuff at midfoot needs a lot of room. Walking around barefoot, it would get dirty fast, so I'd put a sock over it. It's good for keeping my toe aligned while doing my foot exercises, although it prevents the second joint from bending.When the incision from my second surgery is fully healed, I'll go back to using Kinesio tape. Taping the joint keeps it in alignment, doesn't restrict any joints, and fits inside any shoe. (Don't do like I did and put Kinesio tape over an incision that is not 100% healed.)I'm using this device to maintain correction post-op. For someone trying to correct an existing bunion, I have two thoughts...1) If you have severe bunions, forget it. With really severe bunions, the correction has to be done at the BASE of the first metatarsal (physically, that's at about your instep). If you could see an x-ray of my foot before surgery, you'd see how impossible it would be for a device like this to have any impact on my foot since this device is putting pressure at the head of the first metatarsal. If you have severe bunions, go find a competent podiatric surgeon (and don't wait as long as I did to do it).2) If you have mild bunions, apply the pressure very slowly - just a little at a time. You are trying to move bones. Think how this deformity happened in the first place. It happened very slowly over time, most likely from wearing naughty shoes. (If you were born with bad feet, like me, you'd have severe bunions.) So don't yank your toe out of joint with this splint. Pull it just a little bit from where it is. Slowly, slowly. Did you have braces as a kid? Remember how that worked? This is the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KROHBYFFTREN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HWS8EO#wasThisHelpful","R2KROHBYFFTREN","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is rewrite of my original review. I originally rated the spin dryer 1-star because I couldn't get it to spin, and the company's customer service is absolutely dreadful.In googling the company, I happened upon their Better Business Bureau (BBB) page. BBB gives the company a rating of ""F"" (Fail) due to multiple complaints, mostly about poor customer service. I, too, have experienced their terrible customer service, but - ironically - I also found the solution to my spin dryer problem in a company response to a complaint on the BBB page.There is a metal bar screwed into the bottom of the spin dryer. It's not documented anywhere (not in the manual, or on the product page on their Web site), but it's a motor lock, and you have to unscrew and remove it or the spin dryer won't work. I'm just glad I didn't try it too many times with the motor lock on - that likely would have damaged it.This is a company with good products, and just about the worst customer service and product documentation I've ever experienced (especially from a company with good products). They are very hard to get hold of. They do not always answer their phone during their stated business hours, and they do not answer email. When you are able to reach them by phone, the person answering speaks such poor English it's almost impossible to communicate. It's a 3-person company: the owner (who the woman answering phones never lets you speak to - ""he's too busy""), the warehouse manager (who sent me incorrect tracking numbers for both items I ordered), and the woman answering the phone, who has a very heavy Asian accent, and does not speak or understand fluent English.Their bad customer service wouldn't be such a liability if their documentation weren't so dangerously insufficient. I can't fathom how they could print a manual for this spin dryer without the instruction to remove the motor lock on the bottom. I saw the metal bar on the bottom, but I had no idea what it was, or that I should remove it. Their Wonder Wash machine (very cleverly designed) also has insufficient documentation. The assembly instructions are incomplete. I was able to figure it out, but some people can't (see the reviews for that product).All that said, the spin dryer does work very well, and I'm glad I have it. But it was a stressful few hours until I figured out why it wouldn't spin (with no help from the company). Some people on the BBB site say the company honors their warranties, some say they don't. I'm glad I didn't have to test that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PVMWKJ12SV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDWTQKI#wasThisHelpful","R19PVMWKJ12SV8","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm giving this 4 stars rather than 5 because, after 2 weeks of use, the padding is fraying and compressed at the knee, and there's no way to replace it. Replaceable padding should be part of the design. I had bunion surgery and have only another week or so where I can't put any weight on the foot, but then there is the other foot. A product that costs $150 shouldn't disintegrate after a few weeks.Also, I wish there were some sort of hook or something on it that made it easier to lean against things when I take it off. It's always falling over (with a crash). At home, I find I can use the upper thigh band to hook it onto a table - knee bed extending beneath the table. But that only works if I'm in the spot near there. In other parts of my apartment or in the park, it's hard to lean it next to me without it crashing to the ground.That said, I am very grateful to have this knee crutch! I would be seriously screwed without it. I live on the 5th floor of a walk-up, and I don't know how I'd even have gotten home after my surgery, if not for this knee crutch. It's a very clever device. It gives me freedom and independence for the 3-6 weeks I can't put weight on my foot following foot surgery. Using the knee crutch, I'm able to vacuum, cook, do dishes, and even go grocery shopping (though that was exhausting - not sure I'll try it again).It takes some practice, but after using it for a while, it feels very natural, stable, and safe. Old-fashioned crutches feel downright dangerous compared to this knee crutch. Though it takes 10-20 seconds to put on and take off, I use the knee crutch almost exclusively because it feels so much safer.But as good as it is, it's not the same as walking on two feet. Here are some important caveats:1. Within my apartment, I don't bother with a cane. But that's because the floors in my apartment are perfectly flat. This knee crutch is seriously hazardous on non-flat surfaces - cracked sidewalks, potholes, lumpy repaved roads, and especially inclines. The most dangerous of all is an upward incline. If you're not extremely careful, you will fall over backward, even with a cane, which I always carry when I go outside with it. Another reason to carry a cane when you go out is that, while steps are navigable, you need to hold onto something. Some steps - like stoops - don't have bannisters. The higher the step, the more difficult.2. Make very sure that you have adjusted it properly, and your hips are at the exact same height when your ""feet"" (the good foot and the crutch foot) are together. If it's not adjusted properly, it can cause serious back pain. At first I had it too high, because I adjusted it wearing shoes, and ended up mostly wearing slippers. That caused excruciating pain in my lower back on the injured-foot side - the muscle used to raise the leg in the crutch. When I lowered the height, I lost track of what hole the peg had been in, and lowered it too much. That caused a different kind of back pain. I finally got it right, and I have no back pain anymore. I read in the company's description that you'll have pain in some leg muscles at first. I never had any sore muscles in my legs - but then again, I have strong legs.3. It's tiring to use, especially at first when you're using muscles in ways they're not used to. The first week I used it, I would get very overheated after walking around a bit, and couldn't figure out why. Eventually I realized it was exertion from using the knee crutch. You get a workout! After 2 weeks, it's easier, but it still puts unnatural stress on the body. It becomes uncomfortable if I'm on my feet too long. After an hour or two, the knee in the crutch starts to ache from the pressure of my weight, and my good leg gets really tired from doing so much extra work.So it's not perfect, but it's very, very good. I'm very grateful to whoever thought of this thing.One other tip... As I said, I live on the 5th floor of a walk-up, and that's a lot of stairs. I have found that it's easiest to go down the stairs backwards. Sideways, you have to be very careful not to bump your injured foot, and in a narrow staircase, sometimes there's no avoiding it. Backwards still takes two hands (one on bannister, one on cane), patience, and concentration, but it's much easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3O5KQ6F90EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G63AWMG#wasThisHelpful","R2G3O5KQ6F90EZ","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cheaply made device. I bought a pair of them, and when I first took them out of the box, I was concerned at the flimsiness of the switch you use to select between transmit and receive. But I remained optimistic (for a while). I paired the two devices and enjoyed that I could move the transmitter around and the receiver would pick it up without having to re-pair.But the next day, when I went to turn them on, the device set as the receiver started flashing red. I'd only used it for an hour or two so I couldn't see how the battery could be drained already, but I tried plugging it into power again. Though I left it there for hours, the charging light never came on. I went to the Avantree Web site to request support, and saw it's a Chinese company. No wonder. It's very cheaply made, and most likely the battery is faulty.This is a very poorly built device, and whether it works for you will be hit or miss.

"This is an on-ear (versus over-ear) headset, so there is major sound leakage. If you are looking for a headset with good sound isolation, forget this one. Also, I find it quite uncomfortable because I don't like things pressing against my ears - even soft things - which is why I (try to) only buy over-ear headsets. I thought that's what this was because of the misleading first review that says (erroneously) that it has excellent sound isolation. It has no sound isolation. You hear everything around you, and everyone can hear what you're listening to. I'm returning it for this reason.That said, the sound quality and microphone quality are quite good. So too bad that the ear cups are uncomfortable and don't isolate sound.I was able to pair it with my Windows 7 computer, but NOT with my Surface Pro running Windows 8.1.

"I was very disappointed in this speaker. I read a lot of positive reviews before buying, and it didn't come close to the promise.First of all, the sound quality is poor - not mediocre, poor. It can get loud, but there is distortion and some fuzziness. It is not the crystal clear sound you hope for by a mile. It's tolerable for speech, but with music it would give me a headache.Second, there are serious stalls and drop-outs. I did a reset of the unit per tech support and the drop-outs became shorter, but they didn't stop. For every 10-15 minutes of listening, there would be a drop out as short as 10 seconds or as long as a minute. When I tried to use it with Skype, the microphone would always cut out about 10 minutes into the call and never come back.Last but not least, there is a conflict between the driver for this speaker and the standard Bluetooth mouse driver on Windows. When the speaker was connected to my computer, my BT mouse would lose connection and I couldn't get it back. I wasted DAYS trying to find the problem before I realized it was directly related to whether the speaker was connected. When it was not, the mouse worked perfectly. When it was, the mouse would disconnect and I could not reconnect it. At first I made the mistake of removing the pairing with the mouse, but then the mouse could not be paired at all. I had to do the thing of removing the battery the holding the power button for a while to clear saved settings before I could get it to pair again (and it took me a LONG time to figure that out). Eventually I discovered I could get the mouse to reconnect if I turned off the BT radio then turned it back on. But who wants to be doing that 100 times a day. And it's all the fault of this speaker's driver. The mouse driver is the default BT mouse driver - used with a Microsoft mouse on a Windows notebook. I wasted so much time tracking this down.I have come to hate the UE Boom and I am returning it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1FW5NU2VZO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM0XHNS#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1FW5NU2VZO2","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These look okay, but because they are woven, they don't give the benefit of vinyl's ""waterproof-ness"". If you spill something, it goes right through the holes in the weave - the table is not protected. A cotton weave might actually protect a table more because it would absorb what was spilled. On the other hand, woven vinyl is easier to clean than woven cotton.Although these mats don't provide much protection, they do serve my other purpose: they keep my dishes from sliding off the lap table I sometimes use to eat. The mats aren't sticky or tacky, but they have enough texture to stay put and keep what's on them from moving around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTD7ZPPT4WX7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BE8HK4Q#wasThisHelpful","RTD7ZPPT4WX7N","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My very small NYC apartment only has room for an under-the-counter refrigerator. These usually have ""coolers"" rather than true freezers - a compartment that is colder than the main refrigerator, but not cold enough to freeze ice cubes, meat, frozen vegetables, ice cream, etc. After extensive research, I finally found the one-and-only under-the-counter unit with a true freezer, and this is it!I asked my landlord to buy me one in July 2006, and he did, though it costs approximately double what under-the-counter units usually cost (what a guy!). That was nearly 8 years ago, and it still works perfectly (and silently - quietest refrigerator I've ever owned). It was manufactured in Slovenia, for those who care. I don't know if they are still made there, but I'd guess they are.When my landlord asked me which direction I wanted the door to open (what side to put the hinge on), I made a mistake. I should have asked for it on the other side. I didn't realize this was fixable until this week, so for 8 years I've been leaning over the door to get into the refrigerator and freezer. I've done some damage by doing this. I broke off pieces of the vegetable bin by overloading it and then pulling it out in an awkward way (not supporting the weight). I also (totally my fault) broke off the freezer door by putting excessive weight on it as I leaned over the open door.The vegetable bin damage was no big deal, but a working freezer door is essential. So after I snapped that off, I went to the Summit Web site (summitappliance.com) to order replacement parts. My email was answered immediately and the new freezer door and bin were shipped the same day. The manufacturer is located in the Bronx and appears to be a small company, making it easy to reach people and get whatever help you need.While I was on the Summit Web site (tagline, ""Manufacturing specialty appliances since 1969""), I noticed that the CT66J lets you reverse the direction the door opens. Not all refrigerators let you do this at all, let alone so easily, and it's a very convenient feature. The manual has instructions, but I didn't have it for some reason (I guess my landlord kept it), so I downloaded the manual from the Web site. I started to do the reversal tonight, but after I removed the door (very easy to do), I found I needed a socket wrench to complete the job. So I put the door back on and ordered a cheap set of socket bits for $6. I'll finish the job as soon as it arrives. No more breaking things by leaning over the door!If you are looking for an under-counter-refrigerator, this is the very best you can buy. It costs more than the ones with a ""cooler"" rather than a freezer, but for me it was very much worth it. I am grateful to Summit for making the world's one-and-only under-the-counter unit with a true freezer! Finally I can store frozen foods, make ice cubes, etc. Plus it's well-made, very quiet, and customer service is excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R281OEV4O2PT7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q6EZRU#wasThisHelpful","R281OEV4O2PT7Y","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really thick spatula - not very spatula-like at all. It doesn't really bend. If the edge were straight, it could be used to scrape pans in a non-destructive way. But the edge is not straight, it's curved, so it can't be used in that way. The curve suggests someone might use it to scrape out a bowl, but it's too thick and inflexible to be the best tool for that. A real spatula does a much better job. I bought this because it was purple and got good reviews, but I never use it. The other spatula I bought is a putrid green color, but works much better.

"The manufacturer of this cooktop, Ovente, actually modified the design of the cooktop after reading my original review. I didn't know this for a long time because my review was anonymous and they had no way to get in touch with me. Then a year after my purchase, someone posted a comment to my review saying I was mistaken in my description of the cooktop. This turned up the fact that the current version of the cooktop was now very different, and the problems I'd described had been fixed (see comments below). This prompted me to contact the company about an exchange, which is how I found out that they'd changed the design because of my review. The company rep I spoke to said they'd wanted to send me a replacement after the design change, but didn't know how to reach me. Now that they finally knew who I was, they were happy to exchange my original version of the cooktop for the new-and-improved model, even though I'd bought it a year ago. I had to pay to ship back the old one, but I have a full warranty on the new one.They asked me to revise my review once I'd had a chance to try out the new model (which, confusingly, has the same model number), so here goes...I am hereby changing my original 3-star rating to 5-stars.This Ovente infrared cooktop is excellent - all you could wish for in a portable infrared cooktop. There aren't many infrared cooktops made anymore because induction cooktops are trendy. I have a portable induction cooktop, too, and I like it, but not all of my cookware is ferrous, so I'm very glad to have a portable infrared cooktop as well. The Ovente infrared cooktop is well-designed, well-made, and you can't beat their customer service!!ORIGINAL REVIEW----------------------Original rating: 3-starsOriginal review title: Uni-directional temperature control makes this very awkward-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this cooktop and a high-end single-burner induction cooktop at the same time. I use these two cooktops as my only stove, and I bought this so I would not be limited to ferrous cookware.There is only one thing I don't like about this cooktop, but it's a very annoying thing: the temperature control goes in only one direction (up). If I have the cooktop set to 4 and I want to turn it down to 3, I have to do one of two things:(1) Repeatedly press the temperature control until it reaches the top value (12) then starts again at 1 (that's a lot of button presses when I'm trying to cook), or(2) Turn off the cooktop then turn it on again so the temperature setting is positioned at 1, then click from there to where I want it to be.Besides all the clicks, what's especially annoying about this is, I have to make a mental note of the start number before I make any change, or I can't remember what it needs to be to ""turn it down"". I don't want to have to put so much mental energy (and button clicks) into controlling the temperature of a cooktop. It should take half a second to turn it down slightly, not focused attention and 6 button clicks. Turning down the temperature should be quick and intuitive so I can focus on my cooking.However, there are not a lot of options anymore for infrared cooktops. Most of the ones sold on Amazon are no longer made, and I didn't want to buy something that is no longer made. This is a very functional cooktop - it just has this one design flaw. But it's an annoying enough flaw that I find myself not wanting to use it unless I really have to (I need two burners, or I need a pan that is not ferrous and won't work on the induction cooktop).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J3647ZIOJICV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD6X3N6#wasThisHelpful","R2J3647ZIOJICV","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this cutting board except for the groove around the edges, which drives me crazy. It serves no useful purpose (this is a cutting board, not a carving board), and things are always getting stuck in it. If I chop some onions, I can't then sweep them off the board into a pan because they get stuck in the groove. It also makes clean-up harder. It's a magnet for dust and debris, so I can't just wipe the board down with a sponge. I have to run it under the sink after almost every use. Exposing it to so much water on a regular basis means I also have to oil it all the time, creating an ongoing expense.A carving board for meat or poultry needs a groove because you are cutting something wet. A carving board also needs spikes to hold this hot wet thing you're cutting. This is not a carving board - it has no spikes. It's a cutting board, for prep work - cutting vegetables, and the like. It should not have that groove - it's a serious design flaw.It's a shame because the board is otherwise well made. Were it not for the groove, it would be the perfect cutting board.

"I don't know why so many people complained that this bag smells. It has a new-leather smell at first, but it's not the noxious smell some people here describe.The bag is generally well constructed with quality materials and nice leather (made in Italy) - much better than a similar Chinese-made bag I bought (http://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Leather-Backpack-Handbag-Pocket/dp/B001TEK22C/) where the straps ripped off after just 9 months of use. The Chinese-made bag was inexpensive, but when you have to replace it after 9 months, it's not so cheap. Penny-wise, pound foolish, as they say.The main problem with this bag is that the snap for the flap is positioned too high so the flap sticks up weirdly. It looks like a manufacturing flaw. Even if the bag was absolutely stuffed, the snap would not need to be this high. I wish I could move it down, but it's not possible.The other thing is, the design of the bag is not that wonderfully elegant. The aesthetics are just so-so, and the pockets provided are not as useful as the Chinese bag. I actually like the design of the Chinese-made bag better, both aesthetically and functionally. I bought good-quality leather straps to replace the ones that ripped off for not too much on eBay, but it's a pain to work with leather and I'd need tools, so for now I'm using this bag.I like ""hand bags"" I can carry on my back because it balances the weight. Carrying it on one shoulder makes my back hurt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SLP4R50G8BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096T7YB4#wasThisHelpful","R21SLP4R50G8BL","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive bag and (for me) just the right size - not too big, not too small. There are convenient compartments to make items accessible.I saw the warnings that it was not well made, but bought it anyway on April 5, 2013. One of the straps broke on January 17, 2014, and when I looked closely, I saw the other one was about to rip off, too. That's just 9 months after I bought it. I use it every day, but I don't abuse it. I've never had a handbag break in just 9 months.The leather is very thin - a thin veneer over fabric. You can get away with this on the bag itself (as long as you don't abuse it), but straps need to be strong. The straps get daily abuse just by being used. After just 9 months, the leather covering on the straps is chipped away all along their length, and the weak material ripped at the ends where it's attached to the bag. You can't skimp on straps.I like the bag enough that I'm looking to see if I can replace the straps with real leather straps. I'm finding that even one replacement strap would cost as much or more than the bag, and I'd need two. Bummer. No doubt, this is why the manufacturer used such cheap straps in the first place. Maybe I can find a cheaper way to fix it - still looking.The other thing about the bag is that the straps use that dumb zipper strategy so that, theoretically, you can use it as either a shoulder bag or a backpack. But this just gives you the worse of both worlds. It doesn't work as a shoulder strap when zipped because the placement is wrong so the bag hangs weirdly, and having the straps together at the top instead of spaced makes it sit wrong as a backpack. I never liked that zipper thing on backpack handbags, and most manufacturers do it. If the top of the straps were spaced properly, you actually could carry it as a shoulder bag, just like you can hold a full-size backpack on one shoulder. It's a shame that someone thought up this stupid zipper strategy and then every manufacturer copied it. If I can find some reasonably price replacement straps, I'll put them where they should have been to begin with, and then maybe I'll have my ideal bag.--------------------Edit: I found some low-price high-quality leather straps on eBay. I'll transfer the hardware on the original straps over to the new straps. Should work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIU715EMBCZN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TEK22C#wasThisHelpful","RIU715EMBCZN9","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you bought this tea before the company was sold, you don't want the one on this page. This one is no longer all-natural. It has artificial flavorings.

"Where do I begin.... First the product description is both incorrect and incomplete. Second, this does not work correctly with Android devices, particularly 10"" tablets. It might appear to work okay with smaller 7"" tablets that need less power.The labeling on the AC adapter says:Input: 100-240V~0.45A 50/60HzOutput: 5.1V (polarity) 2.1AThe polarity symbol is a solid line on top with three broken lines below it.Notice the input spec of 0.45A. This Web page gives it as 0.15A.The Web site says that the A port outputs 2.1A and the B port outputs 1A. The AC adapter itself labels the ports as A and B, but does not specify their output amperage (red flag - badly made product alert).The labeling on the DC (car) adapter says:Input: DC 12V/24VOutput: DC 5.0V/2AA: For iPadB: For GT-P1000The Web site says that the A port outputs 2.1A and the B port outputs 1A. There's something wrong with that already since the adapter itself says it outputs 2A. As with the AC adapter, the ports are labeled A and B, but their output amperage isn't specified.Notice how the DC adapter specifically says the A-port is for the iPad? By that they mean any Apple device. The B-port is labeled ""For GT-P1000"". That's the device number of the Samsung Galaxy Tab, so this means the B-port is for an Android device. They must have printed this when the Galaxy Tab first came out. Back then, it was probably a ""Kit for the Galaxy Tab"".Notice that nothing is said, on this Web page or on the device itself, about the A-port or B-port of the AC adapter being for iOS or Android. This is more sloppiness, and a serious omission. Here's why.The reason that USB charger slots are labeled for iPad versus Android is that iOS and Android detect whether to shift out of USB Mode to AC or DC mode - I'll call it ""Charger Mode"" - in different ways. In USB mode, the power draw is limited to 0.5A, the idea being that if you plug an accessory into a notebook computer, it shouldn't draw so much power that it screws up the operation of the computer itself. But if the USB device is plugged into an adapter that draws directly from a power source (an electrical outlet, a cigarette lighter), there's no need to limit the draw to 0.5A. The adapter can set the cap. To determine which mode to use, Android looks to see whether two particular pins are short-circuited. If they are, it goes into Charger Mode. Apple devices do it differently. I'm not sure exactly how, but the two pins are not short-circuited. That's the key point.In this kit, NONE - I repeat, NONE - of the USB ports, on either the DC or AC adapters, have the short-circuited pins that signal to Android devices that they can draw more than 0.5A. This was easy to see because the battery on my Nexus 10 kept draining while ""charging"". But also, I installed an app that can monitor the draw and charge and it was pulling at maximum only about 0.4A. A Nexus 7 requires 1A of power. A Nexus 10 requires 2A.Even if these adapters were operating as designed, the Android devices would be relegated to the 1A USB ports, so for this product description to make it sound like it's designed for Android and an Android device could draw 2.1A is just a lie.If you're not doing anything too battery-intensive on a 7"" device, perhaps you could get away with a charger that is dribbling in only 0.4-0.5A. But on my Nexus 10, even reading white on black text - the lowest battery demand possible except sleep - was drawing more power than this charger was providing, so my battery percentage kept falling while plugged in. The best I can say is it fell a little slower. It did manage to charge the Nexus 10 when it was asleep and not being used at all, but this is not what was promised in the product description.This is one sleezy company. I've asked for a refund and a mailing label, because I don't want to pay for the return shipping. I wonder if they'll even answer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REF0T24EE6I2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANLH4MI#wasThisHelpful","REF0T24EE6I2B","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** [...] ***This is an update to my initial review. There *is* a problem with the BLACK SB6141 modems, but it's not what I originally thought.The BLACK modems are older than the WHITE modems, and ship with an older firmware version that had a serious bug (v1.0.6.3). If you are a TWC customer, BEWARE. As of February 2013, it was TWC policy to NEVER update the firmware of customer-owned modems. I don't know the policy today or the policy in other areas, but if your ISP will not update the firmware of any customer-owned modems (or won't update the SB6141, specifically), do not buy this modem!** Confirm with your ISP that they will update the firmware before buying this modem. ***My initial review repeated what a Motorola tech support person told me - that my modem was defective (constantly ""flapping"" - dropping the connection) because it was fraudulently sold to me as new when it had to be used - had to be used because it was black, and not the version intended for consumers. The black modems are non-retail - sold by Motorola only to ISPs. The white modems are the ones meant to be sold directly to consumers. He knew there were a lot of problems with the black modems because he was fielding so many phone calls, but he guessed wrong about the reason for the problems. Apparently, the BLACK modems ARE being sold new to consumers by unauthorized sellers (and thus are not under warranty!). However, they have older defective firmware on them, and the only party that can legally update the firmware per DOCSIS 3 is the ISP. Some ISPs - notably, TWC - refuse to do this as a matter of policy. Others, like Mediacom, don't support this specific modem.ALSO NOTE: The BLACK modems are NOT UNDER WARRANTY from Motorola because they were not intended for the retail stream. Only modems purchased from authorized sellers are under warranty, and authorized sellers only sell the WHITE modem.--------------------------The comments to this review contain endless arguments, mostly about whether the BLACK modems are new or used. The most recent comments challenge whether there really was a firmware bug. For the sake of the innocents who come by and read this review, here is the documentation.And by the way, the reason I know all this is because I was bit by this bug - BAD. I bought my own cable modem (a black SB6141) as soon as I could, and then the nightmare began. Everything you are about to read is stuff I learned on my own because TWC was of no earthly use at all. I work out of my home and critically need internet. TWC wasted months of my time and cost me thousands of dollars without ever finding the answer. I found the answer myself. No one at TWC even knew about the firmware bug.--------------------------NOTE: Amazon is probably going to remove all the links from this review (though they are very useful and don't link to products). If you want to see them, look at page 23 in the comments.--------------------------The link below is to a scan of the Motorola firmware update documentation, listing the defects fixed in firmware version 1.0.6.8. Firmware v1.0.6.8 is what the WHITE modem ships with. The BLACK modem ships with an older version of the firmware, v1.0.6.3.[...]Motorola added one ""new feature"" (optimized performance a bit better) and fixed several things, but here is the critical bug (and I quote):-----------------------8.1.2 Defects Fixed- A random connectivity issue caused by T3/T4 timeouts when operating in Upstream Channel Bonded (USCB) mode has been resolved. Previously, the SBCM would stop ranging on an upstream after a RNG-RSP ABORT is received from the CMTS for one of the upstream bonded channels, causing the unit to reset. Now the unit will not reset, but continue operating in Upstream Partial Service Mode, utilizing upstream channels that fall within the allowable DOCSIS upstream transmit power ranges. (SB-2790, SB-2643, SB-2638)-----------------------In English: Because of a firmware bug, the modem was over-sensitive to any kind of line problem, and lost the connection completely when a problem was encountered. The firmware update corrects this. Now, if one channel is out of range, the modem ignores that channel and uses the channels that remain in-range - i.e., the modem maintains a partial (slower) connection instead of dropping the connection completely.You can see from my modem log (which I saved) that the horrible ""flapping"" problem I experienced (constantly dropped connections - sometimes every few minutes) was caused by this bug.

I still have plenty of errors in my modem log, but this modem (with its non-buggy firmware) recovers gracefully from the crappy lines and equipment around here.*************** BOTTOM LINE!!! ***************CONFIRM WITH YOUR ISP THAT THEY WILL UPDATE THE FIRMWARE OF CUSTOMER-OWNED MODEMS - AND THE SB6141 SPECIFICALLY - BEFORE BUYING THIS MODEM. IF THEY WILL NOT, DO NOT BUY THIS MODEM!! AS IS, IT IS FAULTY.THE WHITE MODEM HAS A LATER VERSION OF THE FIRMWARE - THE ONE THAT FIXES THE DEADLY ""DROPPED CONNECTIONS"" BUG.

"I didn't mind that the interface was poorly designed. I didn't mind that it wasn't that great an equalizer. All I wanted it for was to balance the Bosc computer speakers (which otherwise can't be adjusted) that I'm using to replace the tinny sound on my flat screen TV. It was adequate for that, so I was satisfied. But I do mind that it died after 2.5 years. I know that as equalizers go, it was ""cheap"", but for what I paid, I think it should have lasted more than 2.5 years.First the sound got increasingly buzzy for several days, and then there was no sound at all. I thought my Bosc speakers had died, an upsetting prospect because they cost several hundred dollars. Then I realized it was the equalizer that had died. Annoying.

"Note that iPads have a 9.75"" screen and very little edge. The iPad 1, 2, and 3 all are 9.5"" long, 7.3-7.4"" wide, and .3-.5"" thick (the iPad 1 is .5"" thick).The product details say this:""Product Dimensions: 1 x 11 x 9 inches ; 5.3 ounces"" but many of the reviews here note that the iPad ""fits perfectly"". How can that be? A case this size would be too big for the iPad, wouldn't it? I'll tell you how that can be, having ordered this case and returned it. The listed dimensions (and weight) of this case are incorrect.This is the real size of the case: 3/4"" x 10"" x 7-3/8"" ; 4.5 oz (with the tag, which I didn't remove). I measured at the shortest points, since that's what the zipper has to close over!As you can see, an iPad would fit perfectly in a case of this size, but a device with a 10"" screen (like mine) would be too long for the case. A couple reviewers with 10"" devices said they stretched the case over their devices, but that's a bad idea. Over time, either the stitching will rip the fabric or the zipper will break. The case is too short for a device with a 10"" screen. If it were 11"" long as listed, it would fit most thin devices with 10"" screens. But it is not.This case has another significant problem in addition to the product description. The zipper doesn't have fabric lining as a well-made zippered case should. I have a zippered case for my iPad and fabric beneath the zipper protects the device when the case is zipped (Brenthaven 5103101 Ecco-Prene Sleeve for Kindle / Tablet / Apple iPad - Black). Also that non-square shape with the bulging corners is for a slip-case with no closure, like the one I bought for my Kindle. The sides hug the device so it doesn't fall out. In a zippered case, the bulging corners just add pointless bulk.If you're looking for a neoprene case to fit Acer or Asus 10"" netbooks or tablets, here is one that truly fits: Case Logic PLS-9 Ultraportable Netbook Sleeve for 7-Inch to 10-Inch Netbooks (Black)I've had to return two cases so far because of misrepresentations in the product descriptions, so I hope this helps someone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HR9RLM6LGWFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WK559A#wasThisHelpful","R2HR9RLM6LGWFE","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a longstanding habit of buying headsets and then not using them. Either they fall out of my ears or the way they feel annoys me or I can't tolerate the lesser sound and microphone quality. Not so with this headset. No compromises! It is so light and comfortable I don't even know it's on my ear. I can wear it all day without irritation. The sound quality is terrific, and so is the microphone. I left voice messages for myself on another line with this headset and then directly into my cell phone (voice messages that are delivered as MP3 files to my email so I could listen side-by-side). The sound quality is identical. I haven't tested the noise cancellation features yet.Plus it has a nice feature set. I paired it with both my phone and with my computer - originally with the idea of using Skype on the computer, but I also use Dragon dictation software. It's slightly inconvenient to switch between the two modes, so I had the idea that I could instead use Skype on my phone and then I wouldn't have to switch modes. That works - I can use the headset for both the cell phone and the Skype app on my DroidX phone. I also can stream audio through the headset and listen to MP3 files - I don't think every bluetooth headset can do that.I haven't tested the battery life yet, but that is supposed to be excellent, too.High quality components, good feature set, and moderately priced - what's not to like? I'm very happy with my purchase.---------------------------Edit: I had trouble getting the headset to work with Skype on my DroidX phone at first, then it did. Now I'm trying to get it to again and it won't. The earpiece works, but the microphone doesn't. I can't figure out why. So maybe that bit won't work. Wish it would. I did get it to work once, so I ought to again, but I don't know how I got it to work that one time.Ugh - the more I try to do it (I keep trying the Skype Test Call), I find that the headset is somehow frequently launching the audio app during the call. Why?? I saw mention in another review of the audio app on the DroidX being launched when trying to access Voice Commands. There is something wrong. Too bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJNMS7RVL96C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IMB5NG#wasThisHelpful","R2WJNMS7RVL96C","A32SDHG6VBJ505","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32SDHG6VBJ505?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This company is sneaky. They use a very cheap low quality part in the place you are least likely to notice it: the microphone. The design is nice and the speaker quality is good; I can hear clearly. But people can't hear me well.I did several tests calling my voice mail with and without the Pop Handset. With the Pop Handset, the sound quality of my voice is very poor - there's a lot of noise and it's hard to make out nuance and expresson (critical for me because I do counseling over the phone). Sometimes it's even hard to understand what I'm saying. When I'm speaking without the Pop Handset, directly into my cell phone, the difference is dramatic. My voice is crystal clear. The microphone on this thing is terrible.I am returning the Pop Handset for a refund.

"I've been a casual user of Office for years. Mostly for business purposes, with the occasional personal use. Primarily using Excel by editing or creating basic spreadsheets. Nothing advanced here, but it's definitely handy. As a Mac user, Apple obviously has Pages and Numbers, which work pretty well, but some of the features I use (such as Data sorting and text to column features) are not available in Numbers as far as I know.Since Microsoft made Office 2016 available as a preview, I've actually been using it for sometime. I'd previously been using Office 2011, but got a new Mac, and the installation got all messed up. Couldn't find the disc, but decided to try out the 2016 preview. It's worked nicely. Microsoft has definitely improved the visuals, and having everything be able to sync up via the cloud and iOS is a huge improvement over 2011.As I mentioned, I really don't use it a lot, but I use it enough to have to justify owning a copy. The Home/Student version is decently priced, but I do wish it allowed for at least one more Mac installation. I have a Macbook Air as well, which I'd love to have it installed on, but, sadly, MS doesn't allow more than 1 Mac. Thus, Pages/Numbers have to do for me there. Utilizing Office 365, obviously, solves this, but costs a little more than I want to put in considering my little use.Feature wise, I'm sure there are new things others have been dying to have. Again, for me, it does what I need it to do. I'm fairly basic, and simple Word processing for editing of docs, and basic spreadsheets are all I use it for. I've not tried the new PowerPoint (prefer Keynote anyway), nor One Note. Just do not have uses for them. Office 2016 does what I need it to, doesn't crash often, and allows for me to be productive on a Mac. Can't beat being able to do that, in my mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VCR3RTKRBK2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148BYIPY#wasThisHelpful","R3VCR3RTKRBK2P","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We picked up the $50 Kindle for my son and he desperately wanted a case. His favorite color is red, but they didn't have that available in this style. We opted for the Navy. For $15, it's not bad at all for a case. It has all the features/functionality of the more expensive cases, and still feels pretty nice. It's not leather, nor it is advertised to be, but is definitely made of PU (polyurethane).

"We have been long time users of LeapPad devices. We started with the explorer, and have had pretty much every version since, including the latest Platinum. We've been happy with them in general, which is why we've continued to get them for our kids. There have been headaches with them over the years, such as apps disappearing, cracked screens, wifi not working, battery life, cartridges getting lost, and more.The latest platinum has been great, and has solved nearly all of our concerns (minus the time limits not allowing zero time), but upon learning about the Epic, I was very intrigued. This did seem like the ultimate device for my kids. My son around this same time decided he wanted to buy the new $50 Kindle Fire, so this has been a good comparison for us as we've now had both devices.Setup is pretty easy and as expected. Connect to wifi, add your Leapfrog parent account, choose the free app, and it downloads everything you've purchased in the past. It's great! I feel like it downloads content a lot faster than the previous LeapPad devices as well, which is an added plus.What I like best about the Epic is it can nearly become the one and only device. While my son does have the $50 Fire, he still has a separate LeapPad Platinum that he uses. That's works, but the Epic pretty much makes it so you only need one device. The fact that it runs Android tells is all. I love the fact that my kids can play their existing Leapfrog games (best part is it downloads them quickly and without cartridges) as well as being able to side load the Amazon app store. You still have full control over which apps you can download from Amazon, and allow your kids to use. This has allowed us to add Amazon instant video for kids as well as the Kindle app. Suddenly all the content from Amazon I get free via Prime is available on the Epic. My daughter, who uses the device, literally has everything I'd want her to have on one device. Again, comparing this to my son with the $50 fire and the platinum.As others have mentioned things like this, there are some great hidden easter eggs on the Epic as well. Things like touching the cat on the main street allow pops up the weather. Touching other things has other games and features, which make it all the more interesting for the kids. Main street (which is the home screen, btw), also allows for kids to add stickers and customize the look of the street. Stickers are basically things like robots that can be added and move around the street. Kinda cool.Leapfrog has done a great job on this device. I really do not have any complaints. It's a solid device. Performs well. Has expandable micro SD storage, allows my kids to use both Android apps from the Amazon app store as well as all of the Leapfrog games they already have. It's customizable. Able to grow with your kids. It is a fantastic tablet. For $140, it might be a bit pricey compared to say, the $50 Fire, but there is something to say about the experience. It's completely setup for kids in mind beyond anything else I've encountered. A solid, fantastic update to the Leapfrog line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K14U3QU5D43Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NMTJA6#wasThisHelpful","R3K14U3QU5D43Y","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have had an old baby monitor for sometime that need replacing. It often would disconnect. Having something that was wifi intrigued me, and I thought it would work great since it uses an app.Setup was pretty quick and by the book. Download the app,  connect to the camera, add wifi and user/password, and youâre set!The app itself needs some better design, but it gets the job done. It texts you if you setup motion or sound defection, lets you play 5 different songs, mute, talk to your baby, and more.Video quality is far better then our previous camera, and so I canât complain. We were even able to set it up on different iphones (mine and my wife's) just fine. A nice benefit.The only thing is if you have the detection setup it can get to be a pain. You have to remember to turn it off or the camera otherwise you might get a lot of other alerts if you have others in the room when baby isnât sleeping.Overall, we are impressed!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNKJCK3K3VGSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3GKO36#wasThisHelpful","RNKJCK3K3VGSV","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 6 year old and 3 year old daughters have been into Dora for sometime. We have a LeapTV, and they enjoy watching the episodes.Dora is definitely a good size doll. The description says 11.5"" which is about right. She has one free hand, while the other grips the dog leash. You then connect the dog, which has almost a bobble head, to the dog leash. It has a mini headphone jack connection. Make sure it's plugged in all the way, or the dog won't function properly. The instructions say to not plug the leash into any other device.Dora sings, she can have the dog do tricks, has removable shoes, as well as a removable skirt. She has lots of hair, and my girls love doing her hair (braiding it, in particular). On her chest is a light blue, dog image, which you can push to get her to talk. Since she talks, there is a power button, which is on her right-side hip.One major downside is you're supposed to stand her up to have her dog to tricks. Ours doesn't really stand up on her own. My girls end up holding her up, and then push the button, raise her hand, etc to be able to get her to speak and the dog do tricks.Overall, we're happy with it. My kids love it, and that's what matters. They play with it all the time, and, even better, they continue to have interest in learning Spanish (our native language, of course, is english). Nice benefits to Dora, and something, quality, that you can always count on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIYFOAFOYVVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKTFS8#wasThisHelpful","R3EIYFOAFOYVVJ","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We picked up this book for my 9 year old son. He's an avid reader, and we've been trying out a lot of different series. He's particularly enjoyed Jedi Academy, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Origami Yoda, Diary of a 6th Grade Ninja, and Lemonade Wars. While I didn't read this book personally, I've asked my son his opinion of the book, as well as have obtained his comments. I'm all for letting my kids read whenever they can, especially to try new series and authors. It's good to have a variety. My son's comments are:""Isla is the fox who is telling the story. She lives with her 'Greatma,' brother, and her Mom. They are hunted by the furless, who are the humans. There are other foxes that live in different places and dens. One day, Isla returns to her den, and finds some foxes that she doesn't recognize. Her family is no where to be found. She has to leave her den, and go live on her own. She's also left to try to find her family. At the end of the book, she meets a fox, who is also looking for his family. He talks to Isla, but, sadly, Isla doesn't find her family. The book leaves you hanging.""My son really seemed to like it, and he really wants book two once it comes out. It wasn't his most favorite book ever (that currently is Upside Down Magic), but he definitely enjoyed it. He read the book in about a week, and constantly told us how many chapters he had left, and well as his thoughts on the book.

"We received this for our 7 year old son. The first time, his 9 yearold sister had to assist him to put it together. The next time, he didit almost completely by himself. He absolutely loves building it andhas put it together countless times since, and is not tired ofrepeatedly taking it apart. The best part is, after it's built, he canshoot his siblings with the darts!I have not put it together so can't say how difficult it is, but hefeels the instructions may be wrong in regards to how it shoots thedarts. He says first you're supposed to pull the top lever, then youput the dart in, then pull the bottom trigger to shoot. But it doesn'twork that way, even after multiple attempts to do so. You only need topull the top lever as far as you can and as straight as possible, andthen it works very well.Not sure if that is my son's error or instruction error, butregardless this is an excellent product. It is very unique to buildand be able to use a toy--creates double the fun as the child had towork to make it happen. I think that's a big part of my kidssatisfaction.

"We picked up this book for my 9 year old. The description sounded very interesting, and he was really excited when he read the description himself. He was eagerly anticipating its arrival. Once it arrived, he quickly delved in. I personally haven't read it, but am always looking for new books for my kids to read. After a few days, he was more than halfway through the book, and kept talking about how good it was. The next day, surprisingly, he asked if we could ""return the book."" We said no, and asked why. He said he didn't like it anymore. We were concerned, wondering if there was something bad or uncomfortable in the book. After questioning him further, he simply said it was ""boring"" during the part where he was. He decided to keep reading, and two days later he decided the book was ""awesome again."" Here are some of his comments about the book:""When Caw was 5, he was thrown out the window by his parents, and was caught by crows. Since then he was raised by the crows. He has the power to command crows. During the dark summer, a wave of crime and violence started up in the city cased by the Spinning Man. There is a family with a daughter named Lidia. They try to stop the Spinning Man, and Lidia ends up being caught by him. Caw reunites with his parents, and defeated the Spinning Man with the crow's beak/sword.""For me, my kids can spend as much time reading as they want.

"We got this book for my 6 year old daughter. It seemed like a good one that she would enjoy, and after reading the description of the book, she felt the same way. When it arrived in the mail, she literally sat down and finished it in about 15 minutes. It's not a long read, almost a comic book like book like style with word bubbles. Lots of good pictures that help move the story along, which the first half of the book were in color while the rest were are all in greyscale. Not sure why? Perhaps since this is an uncorrected proof, those were not yet completed? She wants the second book, which we're always thrilled when we have another book series we can have our daughter get into.My daughter's input is: ""There once were two sisters. One sister was a ordinary girl. Her name was Olive. She likes science. The other sister is a witch. She likes to play tricks on Olive and her friend, Eddie. One day Olive and Eddie decided to play a trick on Beatrix, the witch. They got a tin can, and went into the garden. They collected spiders to put into the tin can. They put it above Beatrix's door. When she walked in, she was covered in spiders. She had a surprised/scared look on her face. Then she was angry. Beatrix does not like spiders, even though she is a witch. Eddie and Olive high five. Then they heard a crash in Beatrix's room. A potion spilled on the spiders, and they turned HUGE!

"We were in need of some under the bed storage bags, and we liked the design/pattern of these. It's a soft design that matches pretty much any decor. The see through top is nice to be able to see what's in it without having to open. The storage capacity is quite high compared to the big plastic tub bins we've typically used.After we got everything in, our kids were moving them out of the way, and the handle broke on one. Here it was the first day and they already broke. The kids weren't playing or being rough with it either. They were just using the handle to move it. Despite that, it functions, but the handle is no longer an option for the one. Because they're such a soft material, if you don't have it filled, the sides will collapse. When you don't need to use them, it is nice to be able to have them collapse and be easy to store away.Overall, we're glad we've got them. We needed the storage.

"We picked up two new super soakers to replace some aging ones we had. Since it's now summer, we wanted to have some good family water fights.My kids were especially excited about this one, since it had four nozzles. It was the gun they were all fighting for. Even my 3 year old was able to operate it just fine. Note that unlike other water guns (and even regular super soakers), this gun doesn't really have a trigger. The pumping is what actually shoots out the water. I think this is why it worked well for my 3 year old. She was able to pump and shoot us all just fine. if she had to pump and pull a trigger, I'm sure it wouldn't have worked as well.The gun can hold a pretty good amount of water, although I do prefer the other new super soaker that holds more (43 ounces) and allows you to hook it to a hose. Unlimited water is the way to go! This gun isn't bad though, and certainly lasts longer than many of our older guns.

"I've had portable phone chargers for a long time, but have recently really enjoyed the cases that offer the same functionality. As one who travels a fair amount, it's nice to have a device that can easily charge my iPhone 6. I typically find myself charging my phone at least once during the middle of the day, so I can get through the entire day. This case has helped address that. I'd had a competitors version previously, but it literally stopped working after two times.Otterbox, of course, has been around for awhile with regards to protection. Finding one of their products that offered charging was a great find in my mind. Putting the phone in the cast was pretty easy, although it did take some force at times. I literally thought I might break the front panel portion at times, but it lived up to the Otterbox name, and didn't break. I simply then slid the phone in, and put the front protector back on.The back ""button"" for charging is pretty cool. It's a nice indicator, and is easy to touch when holding the case. I recently went to a trade show in Las Vegas, and brought the case. Once my phone hit 14%, I started charging my phone again. It got me back up to 80%, and I was able to survive the rest of the day just fine.A couple issues I had, at times my iPhone complained about ""this accessory not being authorized"" which was a little cause for concern. I was surprised, especially from Otterbox, that I'd receive such a message with the case.I also wish the case could be charged with a lightning cable. The micro USB is fine, but I usually have a lightning for my iPad. I prefer to not have to lug around another cable if I don't have to. Not a deal breaker, of course, but would've been nice.Overall, I've been quite happy with it. I wish it would've charged up my phone more, but it does it enough. It's certainly strong, and I'm sure it won't die after such little use as my last one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYCHD7EAHCERN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2QW13G#wasThisHelpful","RYCHD7EAHCERN","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've been in need of a new shower head for a long time. We'd previously had a Waterpik head that I quite liked. We don't have a water softener, so it was, over time, getting the hard water build-up. Several of the holes were getting clogged. The Waterpik only had two options, one being a massage.This new shower head is pretty awesome. My wife loves the fact that it will make cleaning the shower easier with the removable head. There are a slew of settings. You can adjust settings for just the removable head, and then there is a switch in the back to make a couple additional settings. These include having both the removable head and the main head turn on/off. There is a massage setting you can turn on that utilizes the center of the removable head. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious our water pressure is lacking, as that doesn't work too well. I'd be much more happy with the shower head if that was the case. I realize it's not necessarily a fault of the product, but it is something to consider.Installation was extremely easy. Screwed off the hold head, put on the new one. Screwed on the hose for the removable head to the main head and then to the removable portion. Then we were set.One other thing we ran into was with our wire shower basket. With how it was, it made it really impossible to position the shower head lower. We've ended up getting another one that has a split in the middle. Makes it lots easier to get our shower products versus having the cord hanging down the middle. We can, of course, now move the head position, which makes all the difference in the experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A98M3Q8DO7YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA85LM0#wasThisHelpful","R1A98M3Q8DO7YI","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this book for my 9 year old son. He's an avid reader, and was extremely excited when we showed him this book. He's been really into books like Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Diary of a 6th Grade Ninja, Origami Yoda, and others. This, in his mind, was just as excited. Although I didn't read the book myself, I noticed he couldn't stop reading it. We received it on Tuesday, and he was done 3 days later. Not bad, considering he's in school half of the day.Here is what he had to say, ""Pretty interesting. A boy named Max likes to learn about bugs. He goes to Bug Island, and helps out the Bugs during the battle of the lizards. I'm excited to get the other two books.

"We needed some new wipers for our 2012 Kia Sedona, so I thought I'd give these a try. The drivers side wiper is the correct size, but the passenger size is larger than the standard wiper for the Sedona. That being said, both fit, and work fine.Installation was a breeze, as expected. The included instructions have pretty good instructions for nearly every type of blade install. Our Sedona had the J hook version, so after sliding off the old blades, we simply had to pull up on the tab and slide the new blades on. Then close the tab. Very easy to do, as I expected. I've never really run into any issues installing wiper blades. They're a pretty standard thing to do.The quality of the blades themselves definitely feel more sturdy and superior compared to the old, standard blades they replaced. They reminded me of the blades on my 2014 Mazda 6.After trying them out, they definitely work. Very quiet, and slide over the windshield wiping the moisture away. There is one somewhat large section, slightly out of view (it's behind the rear view mirror) where the blades swipe, but don't actually seem to clear the water away. It's not necessarily a problem, as I mentioned, it's out of view, but I did find it odd that the wipers didn't clear that area as they should. We've had some pretty ferocious snow storms lately, and using them, even at high speeds, worked fine (except for that one area).Overall, I feel pretty good about these. Install was easy, they work as expected, are quiet, and feel sturdy. What more can you really ask for a pair of wiper blades? Hopefully they'll last awhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UMORKOWLZJMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRX9AA#wasThisHelpful","R1UMORKOWLZJMM","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I have been using memory foam pillows for a long time, but mostly the ones from Costco. We've certainly enjoyed those pillows, although the new ""craze"" there seemed to be having gel on one side and memory foam on another. I've always preferred the memory foam side, as the gel side was always a little too hard for me.With this pillow, everything has changed. It features, gel as well, but versus having a solid gel side, it's all blended in with the memory foam. The shape of the pillow itself is a little different than a regular pillow with more rectangular ends versus a sloping edge. We were expecting that to be a little less comfortable. Boy were we wrong. It's fantastic. Extremely comfortable. My wife comments on how when she uses it (we've swapped pillows for a few nights to test) that her neck doesn't seem as stiff in the morning after using this pillow.Considering the price of the pillow compared to the previous ones we've purchased, I'm assuming it's a better form of memory foam, causing the price to be almost double the price we'd paid in the past. That being said, we've been very happy with this pillow.

"We've been in need of a new shower curtain for a long time. We've had one for close to 10 years, that really needed replacing. We'd recently replaced the bath rugs, and thought this brown would look nice with the colors we had for the rug. Of course, installation was easily done. Simply sliding the rings into the applicable holes on the curtain. We're really happy with it!The only real downside to it is due to the color, it does make our shower darker. It's not really a big deal, but that certainly was one thing moving from the lighter color (and somewhat see through) curtain we had before. I guess there is one other downside.

"WOW! I was blown away after hooking up this speaker and using it via bluetooth with an iPhone. It's a pretty decent size (not too big), features speakers on both sides, and, simply sounds amazing, even when using lower bitrate MP3's. Beyond just how fantastic it sounds, it has some great features as well. 18 hour battery life makes it easy to use without having it plugged in to power. The ability to charge devices via USB, answer phone calls, are also nice features.We intended to use it for our daughter's room, but I'm a little jealous, and wanting to swap it out with a similar Panasonic bluetooth speaker we have in our living room. The Panasonic doesn't even come close to the sound the Braven offers.The product comes with several different power adapter types, enabling charging in different countries. A nice plus. You easily pair it with a bluetooth device by pressing the play button. The speaker begins to beep, and then shows up under the bluetooth devices to pair. Enter 0000 as the key, and you're set. You can also physically hookup an audio device using the included mini headphone jack input.Again, I'm blown away by this speaker. It sounds GREAT! For $200, it's well worth the price for what you get.

"This is a pretty decent case. We're using it on my son's 7th generation Kindle. It fits just fine, and has a pretty decent design. He's 9, and likes it. I was a littler surprised that it advertises a microfiber interior, however, it's not like the regular microfiber I'm used it. It may certainly be microfiber, but it seems more like a vinyl.The case front folds backwards just fine to help reading be easier. It features a strap enclosure, which I personally feel is a little cumbersome. I much prefer the magnetic closures of other cases. Again, it's for my 9 year old son, so it's not really a big deal for him. When I've opened his Kindle, I've found the strap often twisted. A cosmetic thing, which really doesn't affect performance in any way, but I hate it when things are twisted like that.For $30, it's not bad at all. It looks fine, feels nice, doesn't add too much bulk, and does the job.

"We were blown away at how soft this bath rug is. It really does feel nice, especially on bare feet, and would be considered quite ""luxurious"" in our minds. Since we have a bunch of little kids, pee, throw up, etc always seem to end up on the bathroom rugs. Having a stain master version is a huge plus for us.

"I love my iPhone 6, but usually do have to end up charging it halfway through the day. These new, ultra slim cases/chargers are a great concept, and still make it so the device isn't too bulky. It's still weighs more, etc, but that is to be expected..and for some, can be well worth it to suddenly have the ability to get through the day with a single charge.As one who travels fairly often, and finds myself away from convenient means of easily charging my device, I've been one who has carried around an external battery charger for sometime to handle this ability. It worked, but certainly wasn't as slickAfter receiving the ZuZo case, I quickly wanted to try it out. Packaging was pretty obviously from China, with UDB stated instead of USB in several  places, but the product itself looked nice. It appears to be utilizing the ""painted rubber,"" which has a nice feel to it. It has two pieces that separate allowing you to slide the iPhone into place. This was fairly easy, but I did struggle with the top part. I couldn't get it to align properly, and it took several tries before I succeeded. Perhaps due to it being new, it was a little tighter, as I've not experienced this issue since.The battery itself was charged about 50%. My phone, at the time, only had about a 20% charge, so I gave it a try. The lights began flashing on the bottom and my iPhone gave the ""charge"" sound, and did show the lightning bolt in the upper right corner. After about an hour, the battery was depleted, and my phone was charged to about 70%. I did still use the phone fairly often during the charging process, so I was quite happy to see so much charged despite the lack of being fully charged.After plugging it in to charge back up, I was able to fully recharge the battery itself in about 3-4 hours. It's worked fine since for me, and has fully charged my phone after nearly being out of battery life. The best part is, it has a larger battery than my iPhone 6 does, so I can even charge it more after fully charging it once.All in all, a great device. Price is pretty comparable to others, and it looks fine. My only concern would be longevity, especially since other reviewers have commented on them failing pretty quickly. We'll see how mine does, going forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZFNWRU0AC7ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRU0BQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZFNWRU0AC7ZM","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been a longtime Leapfrog fan, having owned most of the Leapfrog gaming systems. The LeapTV, obviously, is a new entrance for the company, and one that intrigued me.The Sports game, at least at first glance, reminded me of Wii Sports, although with the Leapfrog twist. My kids definitely enjoy the game, with my 8 year old son enjoying Karate the most. My 6 year old and 3 year old daughters both enjoy the swimming game. Throughout the game you're asked questions, mostly math, from what I've seen so far.There is a bowling game, skateboarding, swimming, karate, baseball, soccer, snowboarding and more. Lots of difference choices, with the options to play with up to 4 players. Some games, such as baseball, require you to adjust the controller to act like a baseball.As a parents, the biggest thing I like is the amount of activity it causes the kid to incur to play the game. For karate, they're literally karate chopping, trying to bowl a ball, swing a bat, etc. Again, reminds me of Wii Sports, but they're asked math questions to proceed through the game. The bowling game, for instance, requires you to ""charge"" up your bowling ball. This is done by selecting the correct amount of balls that the game indicates are required, and then asks a math question.The kids love it. I'm happy we have a game that, like the Leapsters, is one they can all play together while being active. It's not only the Wii U we have to play, they can play LeapTV. Very similar process to the Xbox Kinect system.My only frustration is with the stability of the game. This may be the LeapTV's problem versus the game itself, however. There are times my son was trying to start the game. Proceeded to a quick event, and next thing he knows, he's back at the main LeapTV menu. To make matters worse, the Sports game wasn't even an option to select. This required the cartridge to be removed, and then reinserted for it to work. Again, this may be an issue with the LeapTV itself, but since this is our only game, I'm unable to verify this further. It's definitely a frustration for my kids.Otherwise, great game/system, and one that certainly meets a need many parents are looking for in an entertainment yet educational game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIO1WFRGXRB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6K0C#wasThisHelpful","R1WIO1WFRGXRB4","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, Iâll say that if you need the infant insert (for a baby younger than 4 months they require that you use it), this is the item to buy, as you get the insert with the carrier. Not all Ergo Baby carriers come with the insert, you have to purchase it separately. My baby is older than 4 months, so I did not try out the insert, so that specifically will not be a part of this review.The first thing I noticed with my carrier is that the buckle on the waist strap seems to be backward. I had to twist the strap in order to buckle it so that the end of the strap that you pull to tighten and adjust is on the outside, not facing my body. This problem left me unable to tighten the strap once it was on me.  I ended up removing the strap from the buckle and turning it, so now it is correct.The carrier is lightweight, and not bulky. Overall itâs pretty comfortable to wear. The padded shoulder straps feel nice, and the waist belt helps to take some of babyâs weight off my back and shoulders.One cool feature that I like is that each of the straps (the waist one and both shoulder straps) have an elastic band at the end so you can roll the excess strap and secure with the elastic so you donât have straps hanging down and getting in your way. Another thing I like is the included âhoodâ which is permanently attached to the carrier, so itâs there when you need it, but it tucks away in the front pocket when you donât need it.The instructions included with the carrier are terrible, just some drawings with no detailed explanations of how to use it. They do not show clearly how exactly to use this carrier. I recommend going to their You Tube channel (URL is included in the instructions) and watching the how-to videos, which make it very clear how to use the product.It is a little awkward to try and support my baby and fasten and adjust the âchest strapâ (which is on your back when using the front carry). When the chest strap is placed properly (at your shoulder blades), it is hard to reach behind you to fasten the buckle. Itâs easier to fasten the buckle if the strap is placed higher, just below your neck, but then itâs too difficult to move the strap down in the proper place. I had my husband help me fasten this strap. This, along with other features, will just take some practice to do it smoothly (and on my own).I wish it had the option to carry my baby forward facing, because I think that would be nice when he gets a little older â heâd probably rather see out to where weâre going. You do have the option to side (or hip) carry, but I have not tried this method out with my baby as he is not quite big enough for this position.The first time I really used this â not just at home, but out at the store â my shoulders hurt a little after about 30 minutes of use. This was not bad, however, compared to another carrier I tried previously (when my baby was much smaller). With the other carrier, my shoulders and back hurt a lot after just 20 minutes of use. The next time I used it, I carried my baby for almost an hour, with no pain at all. I think the straps may not have been all adjusted properly the first time. My baby was content and even fell asleep both times in the carrier. He seems happy and comfortable in it. I sure wish I had this carrier with my first three babies! This such a great item to have.At first, I was going to give this less stars, but as I continued to try out the carrier and practice with it, it got easier to use, and I figured out  the little âproblemsâ I had initially that made me not like this carrier at first impression. As I continue to use this carrier, I like it more and more. I look forward to trying out the other positions â side/hip carry, and back carrier (when my baby is older).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T16QARXMBP3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZKBXUK#wasThisHelpful","R2T16QARXMBP3R","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience using in shower lotion. I have very dry skin, especially in the the winter, so I use lotion (and plenty of it) on a daily basis. I thought the concept of using lotion in the shower seemed unusual, but I was willing to give it a try, and see if it helped moisturize my skin better than regular lotion. One of the first tests I do with lotions, body washes and the like is the smell test. The Nivea lotion has a light fresh scent just as I like it.  The result: it left my skin feeling very soft, almost slippery, but not greasy. I liked how my skin felt, but it did not feel moisturized as it does when I use regular lotion after the shower. Though my skin felt soft, it did not seem that the product penetrated my skin, but rather just made the surface feel nice. The softness lasted all day, which is a plus. While Iâll continue to use this product, I will probably not purchase this to use again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMEU719XPP7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV9KLZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EMEU719XPP7P","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is AWESOME! I own a 2014 Mazda 6, and recently went to a Mr. Hotshine car wash to have my car cleaned. They did the whole interior and exterior. A day or so later, I noticed this white film of residue from whatever cleaner they were using for my leather seats. Due to illness and other things, I never got around to trying to clean it off. Literally months later, it was still there, and was just an eyesore to me every time I got in the car.We had some leather cleaner from when we picked up another car that I figured I would try. I'm not even sure the brand. It was pretty generic and probably a private label deal from the car dealership anyway. When I used that, it appeared to have removed the white film, but after drying, the film was still there.Along comes the Chemical Guys leather cleaner. After receiving it, in a nice ziplock back with the sprayer separate, I gave it a try. It was immediately obvious this was going to work. I went through and followed the directions of spraying it on a microfiber cloth then using another cloth to buff the seats. Boy did it work! My car seats looks brand new again! This product is fantastic, and quickly went to work on out 2012 Kia Sedona as well. It did just as good of a job on those seats. I've been sold. This is awesome, and I plan to continue to use it.The ONLY downside I experienced was the sprayer I received had a tube that was too long for the bottle. I ended up cutting a bit off, and it works fine.If you need a leather cleaner, this is the one. No doubt in my mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TF02MQ93BYTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00247DI3I#wasThisHelpful","R1TF02MQ93BYTK","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book for my 8 year old son. We were a little surprised to see it's in a comic book format, but he was more than thrilled about that. It's about 185 pages, and he breezed through the book in a matter of hours.His input on the book is, ""There is someone in the book that says sandwich names differently. There is a group called Lizzarks that attack Herk's (the main character) Mom. Herk escapes. I'm excited for book 2 to come out.""He really liked the book a lot (which was pretty evident by how quickly he read it). The comics are well illustrated, and, while I didn't read the whole thing, I was even entertained by what I read.With comics making a come back, I'm not surprised my son liked the book.

"I've recently tried out the Axe version of the antiperspirant spray, and liked the product. I've been a big fan of the Dove Men+Care products, so was quite happy to see they'd come out with their own version. Although, I think I prefer the Axe scent over the Dove version (my wife feels the exact opposite), I was quite happy with the Dove product as well. It certainly does the job it's advertised to do. although, I do with it had a deodorant as well built-in. Compared to the Axe, you get 0.4 oz more, in a slightly taller container. The Axe also has a cool lid that you turn to enable you to spray. The Dove simply has a removable top, and then you spray. Both indicate to spray 6 inches from the underarm.Definitely a good product, and I'm eager to see what Dove continues to come out with for their men line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GXNLTOWVRUGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIUB246#wasThisHelpful","R2GXNLTOWVRUGI","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We recently saw the movie, and my 8 year old son was floored when he saw this. It looked like a pretty sweet toy, and so we picked it up for him. When it arrived, he tore open the box, and instantly went to work on putting it together. We were busy in another room, and it was close to bedtime, so when he came back to where we were frustrated, I assumed it was due to him not having time to finish putting it together.The next morning, he went right back to work on it before school. He couldn't get it to work, and tried asking my wife and I for help. We had a few things we were doing for our other kids, so told him I'd look at it later. When I finally got a chance, I could see why he was frustrated. The parts are a pain to put together. The biggest problem is they pop off. Once you get it on, you'll find as you're putting on another part that the one you had just done pops off. The instructions are just photos, so nothing is really explained. My wife and I tried out best to fully put on his armor, but were not successful.All it in, it looks cool, and would be cool, if it didn't require an adult to assemble.

"My background is in pro audio and video. As a consumer product, the Samsung provides exceptionally clear sound at all volumes, with various EQ settings for differing music styles and purposes. The system is effective as a home DJ unit and the lights are a fun addition. Its multiplicity of inputs ranging from bluetooth to usb to stereo mini aux in, and the compatible TV mode, make it easy to stream music from any source. The karaoke mic input is a nice touch. It kicks out great bass and fills a large space well. It was not made to move around, but serves very nicely as a home component system with great sound. An excellent choice for house dances, audio for home video, and all around music listening. It plays back rock, pop and orchestra soundtracks with good detail. The speaker cabinets are particle board with veneer, the grilles are plastic. It does not have XLR or 1/4 inch inputs, but one would not expect that on a consumer product. Would be nice to have an auxiliary out jack to feed additional speakers or record karaoke, but you can record to a usb device instead.Overall well-conceived and executed, and perhaps a bit overpriced.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KV2I0HM02G6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVG1WWY#wasThisHelpful","R3KV2I0HM02G6R","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been in need of a replacement car seat, as our current one for our 2 1/2 year old is set to expire in August. We'd previously had an Eddie Bauer car seat, which she'd been using for sometime. It's been great, but it's nearly 5 year old age is showing. Fabric is fraying, etc.This one came along, and we'd never heard of the brand, Diono. My wife, as a result, was somewhat concerned. Checking other car seats by the manufacturer, however, were very positive. Most had 4 1/2 stars with over a thousand reviews. You don't see that very often on Amazon unless the product is good.Once it was received, the first thing my wife commented on was how heavy the box was. Later in the day, took it out of the box. It is quite heavy. Although they market it as being able to be very easy to fold up, etc. I'm not sure I'd want to lug around such a heavy car seat. I guess people do, however.Unpacking was pretty straightforward. I slid it out of the box. Everything was packed nicely. Some straps were folded up and secured with rubber bands, while others were with the zip ties you can purchase. It was, as a result, quite easy to unpack.Since the car seat comes folded up, I had to figured out how to unfold it. The manual had about 5 easy steps that helped me to do. I then followed the instructions for setting it up for my 2 1/2 year old. Literally, in 10 minutes, I had this thing unpacked and ready for install in our minivan.The next morning, I embarked on the task of installing the car seat. After removing the old Eddie Bauer seat, I placed the new Diono one in the same spot. Literally 5 minutes later, I had it installed. It was a bit more loose then I'd like, especially considering that I'd installed it with the latch system. I did also utilize the top anchor that goes around to the back of the seat for additional support.After further inspection, I noticed the latch belt was twisted. I was able to simply detach the latches with the convenient buttons they have built-in. I adjusted the belt, and snapped it back on the latch. Tightened the belt further, and it was as tight as I wanted. Right now we have it front-facing, but I suspect rear-facing would be just as simple.The cup holder solution is pretty slick. It has this built-in rod that you slide into a hole in the car seat. The fabric is cut to have a hole just the right size for the rod. Slide it in, and it snaps just fine.My 2 1/2 year old loves sitting in her ""new seat."" We're happy so far too. Nice to have a seat that will last 12 years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYS4PZQO3T6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISS2S6A#wasThisHelpful","R2HYS4PZQO3T6B","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been big fans of the Leapster, and all 3 of our kids old enough to use them have them. We're always in the market for good, new games, and this is another one that doesn't disappoint. My 6 year old daughter commented, ""It's very fun. It's like Adventure Sketchers. You have missions, and learn lots of things.""After hearing her say that, I had to give the game a try myself. I was quite impressed. As she mentioned, there are several missions (levels) you get to choose from. It's a side scrolling game (reminds me of the old Mario games). You collect jewels, can obtain hearts if you run into Wasps or other obstacles, and end up seeing various animals throughout your journey. You take photos, and are asked several questions about the animals. These include, what kind of animal is it (i.e. mammal, fish, etc). The game them goes on to explain more about the specific animal, and some interesting facts.Overall, I think it is a great game to teach kids about animal science facts. My 8 year old, unfortunately, didn't like it, but I think it's really because he found it too easy. For my 6 year old, however, it's perfect.The only downside I saw was how long it took for the game to load. There were often times when I was playing that it said, ""loading"" and I had to wait for 5-8 seconds before it proceeded. For kids with little attention spans, they may become frustrated with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4F16L3YGC70D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6QG0#wasThisHelpful","R4F16L3YGC70D","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to sew, so I was very excited to receive this Brother Embroidery machine to try out. I own a Brother sewing machine and a Brother Serger, so I am familiar with Brother products. I should mention though, that you do not need to know how to sew in order to use this machine. However, since I already knew how to thread a standard sewing machine, I was able to thread this one without any issues. Before setting up the machine, I read through the manual to familiarize myself with the machine. I must admit, I felt a little intimidated and wondered if this was going to be more trouble than itâs worth. That being said, the instructions were very well written; clear, detailed and concise. Pictures are included to help with the steps.Included with the machine is a seam ripper, small scissors, 4 bobbins, needles, touch pen (stylus for use on the touch screen if desired), a plastic cover to protect it from dust, bobbin thread, a cleaning brush, three spool caps for keeping the spool of thread in place, and a USB cable for connecting to the internet to download more designs. There is also a reference guide which shows the included designs in color, indicating which colors you need and in which order for each design, as well as the amount of time it takes to stitch it.Once I began setting the machine up, I found it very easy to do by following the instructions. (The first time took me some extra time as I was learning how it all went together.) After attaching the embroidery unit, winding and installing the bobbin, threading the machine, preparing fabric and attaching the embroidery frame, I was ready to select a pattern to test out. I as thrilled when, by just sliding a lever, the machine threads the needle for you! What an excellent feature; no need to squint my eyes to try and thread the needle myself. This feature is very helpful when changing the upper thread color in the middle of a multi-color design.The touch screen on the machine is very easy and straightforward to use. It was easy to navigate to find the pattern I wished to sew. I selected a pattern (I began with a one color letter), pressed the start button, then sat back and watched the machine do the work. The results were beautiful! When sewing a design with two or more colors, the machine stops in between colors, then tells you which color you need to use next, along with which part of the pattern it will be stitching. Changing the thread between colors is very easy to do. (You do not need to change the bobbin thread â I just keep white in the bobbin.) Once the machine stops after completing a color or the full design, with the push of a button, the thread is cut so you can either change to the next color, or remove the frame. (You can also set it to automatically cut the thread once the color is completed.) The machine comes pre-loaded with 70 designs including various alpha-numeric fonts, holiday designs, flowers, animals, and of course Disney-Pixar designs too! You can also purchase and download other designs from the internet, which can be saved directly to the machine.You can visit ibroidery.com to purchase and download more designs. The designs are a little pricey, especially the licensed character ones, but you get many more possibilities than just what came with the machine. I received a coupon code for a free download with the machine â 2 butterflies. I found their website to be less than friendly. Once I created an account, I had to keep signing in as I navigated through the process to register my machine and download a design. But, once that was done, I connected the UBS cable and loaded the design onto the machine.The machine is not super heavy (as my serger is), but seems solid. Since I donât have space to keep the machine out, I have to store it away when not in use. Itâs easy to move and pack away, then set up again when needed.In summary, this is a great machine. It is very easy to use, and does the hard work for you. Iâm pleased with the results and the designs that this machine can produce.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MZ8WKNTXORT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGUOT80#wasThisHelpful","R29MZ8WKNTXORT","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been fascinated with the stories of World War 2, which is why I chose to read this book.  The story focuses on two sisters - Isabelle and Viannâ  in occupied France, and what they did to survive the war. While the characters in this book are not real, their stories are based on things that really happened during World War 2. It was a new perspective for me to read of what women did during the war; not just them surviving at home without their men, (fathers and husbands)  but what they did to save those in danger. These women endured incredible, unimaginable circumstances. They were faced with danger and difficult decisions. They had to be brave and strong and keep moving forward despite their hardships.Kristin Hannah has an incredible way with words; her descriptions are vivid; you see what the characters are seeing, you feel what they are feeling; you feel like you are there. I felt like I was experiencing what they were; hunger, deprivation, cold, separation from a loved one, fear, pain, etc. I found the book very hard to put down, as I had to know what the outcome for these two incredible women would be. Each time I did have to stop reading, I found myself thinking and pondering on what I had read, and what might happen next. I tried to put myself in their shoes, wondering if I would have been as brave as them, if I could have survived what they did, if I would have done what they did. This is an excellent book; it makes you feel, it makes you think, and it makes you grateful for what you have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5JJ8N7NSDK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312577222#wasThisHelpful","R1J5JJ8N7NSDK2","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son has been really into Star Wars lately, and is very excited for Episode VII coming out. He currently has a book about all of the various characters in the series, and having this book was a nice compliment to it (in his opinion).Having taken a look at the book myself, it really is a pretty comprehensive summary of the 6 movies. It takes the important portions of each movie, and sets up each scene. There are fun factoids about each scene (things like the midwife robots that helped deliver Luke and Leia), actual comments from the characters in the movie, and, of course, the background information about what is occurring at that point.Personally, I found the factoids among the most fascinating portions of the book. I particularly was intrigued by the scene where Obi-Wan and Anakin fight each other from the third movie. I was not aware there Obi-Wan did not have training to use the force for attacks, only for defense. He didn't have any choice, however, when he had the face off with Anakin.For my 8 year old son who hasn't seen all the movies yet, but is very excited about Episode VII, this is a good way for him to get caught up on all of the things that have happened in past movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXPWYX3VIGPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465420126#wasThisHelpful","R2CXPWYX3VIGPA","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Out of the Ruins is a historical fiction that begins several months before San Francisco Earthquake. The first half of the book was a little slow for me. Abby is hoping for a miracle for her sister, Cecelia, who is being treated in the hospital in San Francisco for cancer. It was interesting to learn about early medical practices, especially in cancer treatment. We learn of Abbyâs relationship with her sister, a possible budding romance, and Abbyâs relationship with God. While I found this part of the story interesting, it lacked excitement for me. However, what we learn about the characters in the first part of the book carries into the second half. Part 2 beings several months later, and it is here that the book really picks up the pace. It tells of what happened to Abby during the San Francisco Earthquake, and the events immediately after. This part of the book was exciting, and I found it hard to put the book down.

"I've been using a memory foam/gel pillow for years from Costco (by Sleep Innovations). It's been a great pillow for me, although I couldn't stand sleeping on the gel side. It was too hard for me. Unfortunately, I sweat a lot at bedtime, and have found my existing pillow to almost be too unbearable to sleep on due to the bad smell.After seeing this one, I was interested. After receiving it, I did need to let it air out for about 3-4 days before I could bear the foam smell. The instructions say to let it air out for 24 hours. It was still too strong for me at that point.Once I was able to start using it, I noticed both sides were about the same softness (if that's even a word). That made me a little happier, as I could then sleep on both sides compared to my previous pillow. So far, after several nights switching between sides hasn't been a problem for me like the Sleep Innovations pillow.One other key difference is when I pushed my hand into the sleep innovations pillow it seemed to mold to my hand a little better and take longer to bounce back.

"We've been looking for a balance bike for our 2 year old for awhile. When this came around, we were thrilled. It showed up, and my wife put it together in about 10-15 minutes. She indicates there were 5 parts to assembled, and it included the two allen wrenches required to do so.My 2 year old (3 in January), loves the bike. It's light enough that she often carries it around to where she wants it to be. Right now she's just scooting it along, as she gets used to riding a bike. She's definitely starting to get the hang of it, and can see her soon using it to lift off without keeping her feet by her side.Our only concern is with it being made of wood, how long it will last if left outside. We haven't had that issue yet, but suspect if it were exposed to lots of elements consistently it could become a problem. We're keeping it in the garage, so don't see it ending up being an issue in the end.We'll update this review as things progress, but so far we're very happy with it. Price is very comparable to other brands as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DF32Z5C7GJEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWVV6C2#wasThisHelpful","R3DF32Z5C7GJEN","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little gadget for quick shredding or slicing jobs. If I only have a little cheese to grate, I will use my box grater. For large jobs, the food processor is the way to go. But for those in-betwen/medium sized jobs, I like to use the drum grater. Itâs easy to put together, and easy to use. It will quickly grate or slice cheese or veggies. The instructions say to first clean the bottom of the suction base. This is important because if there is dust or food residue on it, the base will not suction to the counter. I found that you need to make sure the suction is also completely dry, or it will not suction. Then insert the grater housing, lock the base to the counter, insert the drum, lock it in place, then insert the handle. Make sure the handle is locked completely â or it will come flying off while turning it! You use the pusher to press food down while turning the handle and the sliced/shredded or grated food comes out of the center of the drum. After use, you disassemble everything and wash the parts. Disassembly is easy â except for removing the grater housing from the base unit. Every time I have used it, it has been difficult. You really have to push HARD in order to remove it. Itâs not enough of a frustration to make me not want to use it â because I like using it. Itâs beats manually sliding a chunk of cheese across my box grater. But it is a frustration, which is why I gave it 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335UWIBSJC6GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSI1SZY#wasThisHelpful","R335UWIBSJC6GL","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You always need soap, and with kids, babies, and just the normal things of life, we're finding ourselves constantly washing our hands. We've been a big fan of Seventh Generation, so were very happy to try out their hand soap. The scent is wonderful. I certainly like the combination of the mandarin orange and grapefruit. Not too over powering. Just the right amount.12 ounce is a good size bottle. We typically see far less than that with the other types of soap we buy. Typically we find ourselves closer to 8-9 ounces from other comparable brands.Finally, how was it actually washing? It lathers up quite quickly, smells great, and seems to do the job just fine. The only negative we have is that there isn't any moisturizer. As a result, your hands feel pretty dry afterwards. Throw on some lotion, however, and you're back in good shape.It's a good product. One we'll probably continue to buy. We'll have to try out some of the other scents, but we've been quite happy with this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCKFH2V1SRAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LR2173O#wasThisHelpful","R3UCKFH2V1SRAB","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been in need of a soap dispenser at the office, and when this came along, I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, Amazon shipped these with no packaging in a pretty large box (at least in comparison to the product). The first one I received was broken. The top broke off, and we were unable to repair it. The replacement arrived in much the same manner, but, luckily, wasn't broken. Although this is merely a review of the product, I did feel it might be good to know how Amazon is shipping these. Yours may arrive broken.Now, onto the product. The size is pretty decent, with it being able to hold 10 ounces of whatever you desire to put in it. As mentioned, we used it with soap, and had a gigantic refill container of Softsoap. We put it in, and were able to dispense soap without issue. At least for me, one push dispensed enough soap that I was satisfied. I feel like I'm often having to get two pumps from other similar products to obtain the desired amount. It's definitely working for our needs, but it's nothing really amazing for what you're getting. I'd consider it a pretty average soap dispenser. It does the job, holds a good amount of soap, opens easily, isn't messy, etc. Really can't complain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKIEN4PJA53QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBRO8B8#wasThisHelpful","RKIEN4PJA53QS","A14X244VGHWPSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14X244VGHWPSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a similar Targus product for years, which has been good. It only charges my iPhone up to about 80%, however, before it died. I was eager to try the Xgrid out, considering it promises up to 4 charges for a smartphone.Last Friday, I went on a trip down to Las Vegas. I'm often using my phone, and find myself needing to recharge about halfway through the day. This trip was no different. About 1 PM I found my phone at 7% and decided to give the Xgrid a try. Within an hour, I was back up to 80%. Unfortunately, I had to unhook it at that point, but the Xgrid still had plenty of juice in it. I have no doubt I'd be able to use it multiple times before having to recharge it. There are several indicator lights on the front (as you can see in the photo).

"I've been a fan of Belkin products for sometime. My last car charger was actually Belkin branded, and has worked great with a monoprice licensed cable I've had. I figured getting something with Belkin with a built-in lightning cable would be just as pleasant of an experience.I was really surprised. This didn't work well at all with my Retina iPad Mini. It charged it, but half the time didn't. When it didn't work, it actually complained about not being an authorized cable and may ""damage"" my device. I've seen that before with unlicensed cables, but was very surprised to see it from a Belkin product. My iPhone 5s, surprisingly, never had an issue with the cable, and continues to charge it without issue. Luckily I use it for my 5s most often, but it is still nice to have something that is reliable for my iPad Mini.All in all, it's a decent product. Something I'd not really expect from Belkin.

"We've been a big fan of Charmin for a long time. We've typically purchased the Ultra Soft from Costco, and have always been very happy with it. It's definitely soft, and does the job when it comes to keeping yourself clean. What's better than buying more? Suddenly having 4x the amount on each roll. It's very obvious there is more toilet paper on  the roll compared to the regular ultra soft we get at Costco.A normal roll lasts, in our busiest bathroom, about 2 days. The mega roll, after having been set out Friday is still in use today (Monday). We also still have well over 1/3 of the roll left. Not bad at all. Storage is also a little easier, since you don't have 36 regular rolls lying around. Only 24.We like them. Price is pretty comparable as well.UPDATE: Interestingly enough, although the roll is definitely bigger, the squares are smaller compared to the Costco ones we normally get.

"This stuff is amazing! I have a 2014 Mazda6, and really like keeping my car clean (probably from my sports car days). I've traditionally only used a micro-fiber cloth to dust off/clean the dashboard. It usually works, but with the black interior I have, it really doesn't seem to stay dust free very long. Within a day it's usually right back to pretty much how it was before. Others like Armor-All seem to be similar. They don't keep it clean very long.Along comes the Cockpit Premium. I've never used an Einszett product before, but it really reminds me of a screen cleaner from Bryson that I've used. It simply works, and almost ""repels"" the dust.

The game goes through identifying several different plants and animals that live in the ocean not only by how they look, but also by how they sound.There are also some fun ""missions"" where they're required to move things out of the way to go past, rescue various animals, and more.

"My daughters LOVE to color. I have boxes and boxes of pictures they've drawn, so we were looking for something that might help save some paper. We thought this would be a great product to do so. It's a good size, but folds up, and makes it easy to transport. It includes markers, and so we thought it would be great to take along for trips as well.Unfortunately, after 24 hours, 2 of the markers, despite being capped, dried out. We're a bit disappointed by that, considering we'd only had the product for a day. As some other reviewers commented, the markers are a bit light, however, we found that the color begins to darken on the surface after a little bit.

The only thing we ran into was the fabric covered the on switch depending on how it was slid onto the metal bars.

Hopefully that will change as he gets older, but at 3-4 weeks, he can't last more than 5 minutes in it without screaming.

"I have read and enjoyed a few of Toyne's earlier novels, so I looked forward to starting his latest book. This latest novel kicks off a new series and opens up with one of my favorite tropes of popular fiction - amnesia. A man comes to running down a desert road, with a plane crashed and burning behind him. An impressive amount of knowledge stands at the ready for him, but not his own name or how he came to be on the outskirts of the small town of Redemption, Arizona. Meanwhile, the town buries one of its leaders and other plots come to light as the day continues on with drugs, bloodshed and even a historical buried treasure story. The elements of the story and the layers of the plot work well. Toyne has a real talent for cliffhanger endings which makes this 450+ book move very quickly. Some twists of the plot are genuine surprises, while others are a bit more expected, considering all of the hidden agendas. The ending serves as a neat explanation and lays the groundwork for more to the series - and I will definitely be keeping my eye out for the next installment!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS70PWHDAKCXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062329723#wasThisHelpful","RS70PWHDAKCXF","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description of this novel really intrigued me, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped to. It moves a bit too slowly and rather predictably, too. The writing is pretty stylized and though the young horse thief is likable enough and his relationship with the young woman is rather sweet, neither character is very developed. And the historical detail that I expected for a Civil War setting isn't really there either. Because the characters aren't very easy to connect to, their romance isn't really very vivid either. I almost set this one aside a few times, though it isn't very long...Ultimately, I did finish it, and it ended as I expected it to... My favorite character was the horse, to be honest. I just didn't care for the style of the writing and it just distracted me throughout and made it hard to like any of the bipedal characters. Maybe this would be a good choice for book clubs or discussion groups because I think that different readers would react to this in different ways, but then again, with the simplicity of the plot there may just not be that much to talk about...","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FOB8S3CG56N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077974#wasThisHelpful","R34FOB8S3CG56N","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Young Adult debut novel could have also been titled ""My Big Fat Senior Year"" as there are some definite similarities to that movie... but it is an engaging teen novel that deals with grief (the book opens a few months after Georgia's mother passes away from complications with her diabetes), body image (Georgia, like her mother, is a larger girl) and friendship - along with a little teen romance. Georgia's poetry adds to the emotional level in the book (but be warned, some of the descriptions of her mother's illness are not for the faint of heart). Georgia's mother's dying wish is for her daughter to try everything - which may not exactly correlate with the message some parents of teens want to pass along to their teen daughters (Georgia smokes, cuts class, eats edible drugs - with an experience that seems to glorify it to rather ridiculous heights). There is some swearing, too, and maybe all of these experiences are just par for the course of our rougher world... but I'd not blindly recommend this one to every young adult reader.The Chicago setting, though, is quite nice, though the relationship between father and daughter is not what I would have hoped for. But, by the end, this is a satisfying read. It's a bit predictable, but not in a terrible way. I am curious to see what Kottaras follows this one up with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20DH2EHVITFE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072808#wasThisHelpful","R20DH2EHVITFE4","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Young Adult fantasy novel, set in some sort of dystopian America (but with only names, places and some ""relics"" serving as clues to the origin of the setting). A war has ended and two sisters anxiously await on their family farm for the return of Thom, husband and brother-in-law. When the younger sister, and narrator, hires on a veteran for the winter, it brings change and further troubles. The characters - and their development - is handled fairly well, the plot itself and the type of magic that is the basis for the war isn't very clearly defined and doesn't always seem very sensical - though that may be because of the vague details offered. The development in the relationships - particularly between the two sisters - isn't terribly complex and since it is resolved in one conversation, that's not very satisfying. Plus, the pacing is a bit slow and though the ending's resolution is pretty finite, the very end suggests more books may come later and while I am a bit curious to see if a second installment provides more of the details that I wished for, I doubt that I will be first in line to read it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZ019LY632YX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054428111X#wasThisHelpful","R1WZ019LY632YX","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This debut Young Adult novel and its premise of firestarter teen twins, Alice and Celia, is certainly attention-grabbing. My affinity for teen fiction featuring twins will never dissipate, I think, no matter how old I get! This book opens with a lethal fire and an escape from an Oregon mental institution... and though I had the plot twist figured out from almost the very first page (this actually goes into another guilty pleasure of mine in fiction!), it is a fast-paced read that I read in one sitting (it is nice to be proven right - though a little disappointing ultimately to have it figured out that early). It is an engaging read - and I also have a fondness for diary entries embedded within fiction. A few of the supporting characters provided a few surprises to the plot, but ultimately I suppose this book was too predictable to be completely enjoyable. It is definitely fast-paced, though...","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CUUW0A8BMNNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054448200X#wasThisHelpful","R1CUUW0A8BMNNL","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have heard good things about Gerritsen's writing, but this is my first experience with her books - and though I am not sure what I expected from this book, it definitely is a fast-paced read that completely captured my attention. The narrative follows two storylines - the modern focuses on violinist Julia who discovers in a Rome antique shop, a book of old music - with a never-before-published piece inside. Her obsession with the new music wreaks havoc on her return to domestic life in Boston.The historical storyline opens in Venice and tells Lorenzo's story - a talented musician who soon falls in love with another musician, though the time and circumstances makes their love impossible. It's an engaging novel and not overly long (under 250 pages) and is definitely hard to put down. The plot carries some surprises alongside some more predictable tropes and bits of it range into far-fetched ridiculousness. But the two plots blend together surprisingly well and the book is easy to read in one sitting (perfect for a plane ride to Italy!). I am curious to see what other books Gerritsen has written!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BB0M7SE20M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101884347#wasThisHelpful","R29BB0M7SE20M4","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the title of a book makes you laugh, it is definitely a good sign! This is actually the author's second collection of essays from her popular blog with the same punchy title. I tend to gamble quite a bit on essay collections... David Sedaris is one of my favourites, but in between the long waits for his books, I have uncovered a few other gems - but a lot of duds too. This collection, though, is one of the better ones that I have found. It is laugh-out-loud funny at times and the holiday experiences and decorating is all surprisingly relatable. It is funny and though a bit edgier than some holiday collections (I wouldn't pass this one along to conservative relatives), it isn't overly negative or mean (which is a bit surprising, considering the title). I really enjoyed this quick read and definitely plan on checking out her first collection and keeping an eye out for future essays as well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N3R4PTMRMCJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549996#wasThisHelpful","R3N3R4PTMRMCJW","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't read much science fiction, actually - the fantasy side of the genre is more typically what I read, but this one sounds promising and I am glad to have read it! It opens up in an exciting way, with a spaceship boarded by intruders, but it does take some time to become acclimated to Higgins' world and his word choices. But as the lay of the galaxy becomes more familiar, the book becomes much more engaging and downright thrilling. The setting is limited to the advanced space ship, and the cast of characters is small. Because of this, it gives this decidedly modern story a surprisingly old-fashioned feel in some ways (kind of like a locked room mystery). The pacing slows a bit at times - with lots of telling through some long scenes of dialogue, but the story that they are telling is fascinating.But, it certainly isn't one that I can see easily being translated to the screen - it is a LOT of talking and the action scenes are fewer than I would have expected. And yet, the book never really feels boring. There are layers to the limited cast of characters and it all seems to building up to a plot far-reaching from the confines of the spaceship. And there are nice clues along the way, and it's fun to be proved right about some of them! The book shifts gears in the third section of the book (think 2001) which adds an entirely new layer to the plot. The shifting perspectives work really well and though some of the phrasing is kind of laughable (""spaghettification of the lungs"" for example) - it certainly increases the drama and excitement that is somewhat lacking in the first two-thirds of the book. The ending concludes on quite the cliffhanger, and though I am not dying for the next installment, I will definitely be keeping my eye out for it! I am curious to see where the series will go, and if it will continue to be so limited in its setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HBRJEC2XKM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394428#wasThisHelpful","R19HBRJEC2XKM5","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom listened to the audioversion of this book, and based on her enjoyment, I decided to pick up the paper copy. But, in reading it, I think that the performance must be a particularly good one, and that may have increased her experience. Stone's writing style involves many sentence fragments, and yet there are a lot of gaps in the inner reflections. The idea of an older man, a real survivor tracking down the criminals who scammed him on the titular moving day is an interesting and engaging one, but the perspectives of hero and villain are very similar in style and neither are easy characters to connect with. I think that is an interesting read, but the middle is lagging somewhat. The pacing is measured and not as fast as I had hoped for, though the plot is certainly more unpredictable than it originally seems. The overall fragmented style and half memories though is more frustrating than engaging. But the conclusion is certainly a satisfying one.

"This is the second canister vacuum that we have in our house, and I must admit that this style is just not something that I am as comfortable with. The plastic wheels, though, slide easily across floors (easier on the wood floor than the carpet though) and though the bagless receptacle isn't as large as our Dyson's, it holds a fair amount of dog hair and other debris picked up. It does any amazingly good job with the dust on the wood floors, and achieves a high suction even on the wood, which is impressive. It is much easier to use on hardwood floors than carpeting. The carpet upstairs is perhaps too thick, but I had more trouble using this on there - even the area rug which is thinner, the head just didn't easily slide on. Beware though of anything getting on the wheels, as it can make a contained mess larger if the wheels instead of the vacuum pick up any other dirt or spilled material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BULGE2CG2UZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WI2OOW8#wasThisHelpful","R3BULGE2CG2UZ4","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of Milchman's books that I have read. It opens engagingly with a menacing undertone. A family in their rural and isolated dream house, with their own inner tensions, is told alongside a second narrative of a pair of criminals who after more than twenty years in prison have seized the opportunity to escape. Though this same scenario could take on an almost comical bend (like in some movies with a similar set-up), this one is pure menace and tension... it leaves the reader with a certain sense of dread and allows them to share in the family's terror.And though the connections between the characters and some of their ""secrets"" are easily uncovered, even this knowledge doesn't ease the tension. It's quite the pageturner - I read it in one night (unfortunately while home alone for the night - which definitely increased the fear - my only saving grace is that it wasn't snowing!!!). The book quickly becomes impossible to put down and though the overall plot is a bit predictable with plenty of near-misses at salvation, Milchman still manages to throw in a few genuine surprises. Yes, it could've been trimmed into a tighter story, as there are plenty of characters introduced that do little more than pointlessly raise the reader's hopes, but I think this would have detracted from the overall tension.  It's a very entertaining and downright riveting read - I will definitely be keeping my eye out for more from this author!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4MQWUWFNSE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394819#wasThisHelpful","R1E4MQWUWFNSE3","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Panasonic over-ear headphones have a nice, crisp sound to them and are definitely a quality product for their price. Yes, there are fancier versions from Bose or Sennheiser out there and while those are considerable nicer looking, they come with a much higher price tag.  These are comfortable over-ear headphones, the padding is nice, and they bend nicely with heads, but they may not be for every ear size. They fit comfortably on both myself and my husband - but he has smaller ears and the headphones tops look a little funny on him since there is a lot of empty space between the band and his head. But they are perfect for him to wear while watching YouTube videos on the couch while others are enjoying regular television or a book. They don't bleed noise so it isn't annoying to be seated next to someone wearing these.The fit of the band part looks a little strange, and the flat cord is definitely a different feature, but I like the color combination with the bright green.

"This book hooks the reader right in with its premise - the titular Mia, is seven months old and missing. Her mother, Estelle, has been discovered in a ravine, terribly injured and with unclear memories of the days leading up to her daughter's disappearance and the reasons for own inaction. Her fractured memory and obvious depression make Estelle a bit difficult to sympathize with at first - she is clearly unhinged and so it is hard to trust this so clearly unreliable narrator. The mystery of Mia's disappearance gets stranger and stranger with the more pieces that Mia remembers (even the dirty diapers have been taken along with her!).The desire to know what happened to this missing baby is the real force behind turning the pages. Estelle's perspective is not always engaging especially considering her mental state. This does slow down the overall pacing somewhat, but the latter parts of the book certainly fly by! The ending is so fast that it feels a bit abrupt, though I am not sure that the ending could be any more satisfying - it just all feels very sudden in comparison to the pacing in the middle.

"This YA book opens engagingly with the rather unconventional inner monologue of the about-to-be-sixteen-years-old Aza, who has a rare lung ailment (it's even named after her!) and as she puts it, ""a history of hospitals"". With such a history, her inner voice is tough, with hints of vulnerability as well. There is some vulgar language, but that's about the only non-age-appropriate part of the book. I think an audio version would be particularly appealing, too.And though Aza addresses the reader directly at times which is a huge pet peeve of mine, the book has a convincing edge to even it's most unbelievable sections. It's a surprisingly emotional read, too. The perspective doesn't stay with Aza, but the style isn't very different between the perspectives, so it could be even more powerful if future books in the series develop the other characters more, especially in those sections. The action gets a little chaotic and muddled at times, the book ends leaving me at least anxious for the sequel! It's an exciting read and really feels original with its blend of modern and magic. I definitely plan on continuing on with the series - I hope that the wait isn't too terrible long! There are plenty pf places to pick up the story and questions left unanswered, and yet the ending is still completely satisfying which is a conclusion with a balance that is hard to manage!

"Told from the perspective of Todd, an autistic man who has lived in his care community for over forty years, this narrative is engaging and feels authentically portrayed. Todd's perspective leaves room for the reader to interpret actions and events that it is clear Todd himself cannot clearly comprehend, despite his overall high-functioning level. As one would expect, this is a quite sad novel. With its short chapters, it sets a fast pace which makes it easy to keep reading. But by the time the book ends, my initially positive impression has soured somewhat. There is not much that is uplifting here - it's mostly just sad. And while the facility that is the main setting, in its depiction seems like on the whole a better place, the threat of the staff is a realistic and genuinely disturbing truth included here. It is an interesting book and one that I think anyone touched in any way by the Autism Spectrum in their life, will be able to more easily connect with the characters and the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FRDC0VWUN7PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631490478#wasThisHelpful","R1FRDC0VWUN7PA","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One of the voices is of the victim herself which reveals background not only about her own life, but her family's as well. The other main character is of a friendly neighbor who becomes rather caught up in it all, having known the victim. Though it moves slowly at times, the varied voices keep the pages turning as the reader gets to guess along with the neighbor the identity of the killer - the secret boyfriend with a violent past, the controlling and abusive father or the weak but equally controlling mother or perhaps someone else all together... ultimately, the plot is rather predictable. It's an interesting read, but it's hard to connect with any of the characters, really. And the villain is quite awful, but the ending isn't exactly one that delivers satisfying justice. But as a book, it will keep the pages turning till the end!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMPVXR29FZKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617737666#wasThisHelpful","R3BMPVXR29FZKY","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I actually selected this book because its description reminded me so much of another book set in a Wisconsin small town, Land of Wonders by Lesley Kagen. And though this shares some superficial similarities the two books are not similar at all. The narratives are completely different perspectives and because I was expecting something different, I really didn't enjoy this as much as I had hoped to. The opening, with all of its political maneuverings, moves slowly for those uninterested in that. But, once the first shoe to the plot drops, the pacing does pick up a bit and becomes more engaging as Lucy returns to the hometown she left behind.The book's pacing shifts around a lot - more engaging sections are buried between quilting details and some religious speeches from various Christian churches. The overall plot is quite predictable and the ending is far from satisfying. Lucy's career path doesn't seem to fit either - I just really never connected with any of this book. The most surprising thing about it was that I finished it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZOSSZDVC9VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617736554#wasThisHelpful","R3RZOSSZDVC9VC","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From its premise, this book promises to be an epic family drama. It opens with mention of a mysterious drawing, then flashes back in time to a roaring party in the past with flapper girls and childhood friends reunited. Then it moves to Kateâs story set in 1986 as she continues to grieve the death of her mother, a famous ballerina. When her sort-of-grandmother dies six months later, it is only the day after she reveals a secret about Kateâs mother - she has had contact with Kateâs biological grandmother, and so Kate sets about trying to track down her motherâs biological roots. The clues are pretty heavy-handed and easy to figure out, and though it all plays out rather predictably, it is still an engaging read. I like how tactfully the modern romance is handled so that it avoids any kind of darker undertones, but even in that the plot is very predictable.The novel never really feels fresh - oh there are a few details like the art angle that are new - but really it just feels like a story that I have heard before. The relationships - even the central romance - donât have much complexity and the pacing drags in the middle. The varied timelines both rely rather heavily on telling. The ending isnât terribly satisfying either. And while Foley manages to cram in the more exciting points of European history. I think that this novel does have the potential to be a great discussion starter for book clubs, but I think there are more satisfying and well-plotted reads out there. Itâs not a bad book, but it just never impressed me nor did it ever seem very original.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXJZ32HQO3KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316375055#wasThisHelpful","R2BXJZ32HQO3KJ","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any time I stumble over a book revolving around twins, I pick it up - though this one is from the perspective of a mother who had to make a terrible choice. When Jane discovers that she is pregnant with twins, her limited resources and estrangement from her family leads her to make the difficult decision to give one of her daughters up for adoption. She forces her difficult past behind her as much as she can and focuses on raising her remaining daughter. Though she initially lives in fear, now that Harper is a sophomore in high school, Jane has relaxed - only to have those past threads creep back into her life.Itâs an engaging and fast-paced read. Jane is, for the most part, a sympathetic character, but it is hard not to wince at the sheer amount of lies Jane has based her new life upon. Janeâs semi-secret boyfriend (he is also a teacher at Harperâs high school along with Jane) gives some contradictory advice but itâs a pageturner (though the prevalence of the high school lends this book more of a YA feel, despite the perspective being from Janeâs eyes). Itâs a fun read and though the plot plays out rather predictably, itâs still a lot of fun (there are some scenes here that are straight from the making of Margo though! Sweet Valley comparisons are just never to not be found in books about twins!). The ending has enough room for a follow-up, and I plan on keeping an eye out for Noonanâs books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2QTKBUE26LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617733253#wasThisHelpful","R3A2QTKBUE26LH","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I first heard of this book, I really wanted to read it - and then when I found out that the audio version would feature not only Cary Elwesâ performance, but many of the other actors, directors and producers directly, I knew that I wanted to listen to it instead! I even bought a copy of this as part of my momâs Christmas present since I knew she would want to listen as well. Itâs such a fun listen with tons of fun and fascinating anecdotes about the making of the film and its bumpy road to the big screen and its surprising success on the small screen. Itâs a happy read (though there are definitely some bittersweet moments - especially when discussing those cast members who have since passed) and like the movie itself, this is one audiobook that I can easily envision listening to again and again. It moves quickly and itâs just wonderful to have the inclusion of the other voices to chime in on Elwesâ own memories - it is so nice to see that the film holds just as special of a place in the memories of its makers as it does in the hearts of its fans. Itâs a terrific film and this book makes for the perfect companion to it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XE5EG6NQ5J2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLKFVRS#wasThisHelpful","R1XE5EG6NQ5J2D","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This debut novel initially caught my attention with its Chicago setting - I just love to see my city (and its suburbs, too!) in fiction. And it always seems the most authentic when the author is also familiar with the city - and Fassnacht most certainly is, so I also like to help support local authors! Another famous Chicago author, Audrey Niffenegger, has written a promotional blurb for the book, which makes me even more excited to read this one!Like many debut novels, this one feels lovingly crafted by the author with the opening chapters in particular having a well-crafted feel. The details are impeccable and quickly captures not only the city but makes the characters recognizable as well. The fractured Brunson family feels familiar - not always particularly likable - but definitely realistic and could easily be the family just down the street. The details all add up to a very genuine and likable whole. The younger son, Barkley (with his unfortunate name better suited to a golden retriever) is a struggling young graduate who finally lands his first grown-up job while working on his own writing. Charlie, the older son, is recently returned from the military (the book is set in 2011), their mother has her head in the Zoloft sand and their father, Henry has flown the suburban family home for a bachelor pad in the city and a string of meaningless sexual encounters.But all of the characters (as this most definitely a character-driven plot) grow and develop over the course of the novel - though Barkley is probably the main character with his changes both mentally and physically being perhaps the most drastic, though this transformation is reflected in all of the characters. Though it has moments that are dark, quite sad and ugly scenes with the characters, the conclusion is surprisingly uplifting. Overall, itâs an enjoyable read, well-crafted and satisfying. But it does drag a bit (itâs over four hundred pages long), though I admit to enjoying the added detail that makes the city and âburbs come to life. I will definitely be keeping my eye out for what Fassnacht writes next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LIWQTOTQYUF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059283#wasThisHelpful","R3LIWQTOTQYUF5","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I have a pretty serious addiction to pens - from the pricey antique fountain pens, to the huge, cheap collections of various colors of gel pens/ball point pens - basically, you name a pen brand and I can wax on and on about how much I appreciate it. Uni-ball is a great maker of pens both for their quality of inks and their variety of colors. This new Air pen is crazy-cool - it says that it is a rollerball, but it writes like Penmate's Flair pens - the originals from the late 80s/early 90s. And yet, it is a more unique experience than that. The ink flows easily and it doesn't smudge. The three colors are vivid, but basic so I hope that they will make these in the huge packs with all the colors they offer in their other collections. I would love to add them to my hoard!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXF69Q4F7G6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJBUF8#wasThisHelpful","R2WXF69Q4F7G6M","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cotton pants have a soft fabric feel, but not too thin. It is a hardier pant that is perfect for a business-casual environment. The roasted chestnut color is very dark - nearly black. The pants are a bit long, and overall live in to their relaxed fit as they are not too tight or restricting. The pockets are nice and the seam edging has nice detail. There is a bit of stretch to the fabric which means that you can wear them without them becoming too baggy or shapeless as to be unflattering. Because of the deep brown color, I think I will wear these more often in fall/winter than summer, but all in all, I am quite pleased with these. They don't look inexpensive and feel like they are pretty hardy and won't fall apart after wearing them a few times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVH3K8JSC3SQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V853AEE#wasThisHelpful","RVH3K8JSC3SQH","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm Really excited to test them out on a plane but so far they have done a nice cd job of blocking out household noise of voices, television, and lawn mowers.

But when traveling it is another thing to keep in mind for having extra batteries along with. The buds come with extra sizes which is nice. And the case is a nice small size.

"Motion-sickness is a relatively new ailment for me - I never used to get car-sick ever, but in recent years, I have found that I can no longer read easily in the car or spend prolonged car trips looking out the window without feeling ill. I like the idea of natural dramamine, and so this ginger-based pill fits the bill. It is in fact non-drowsy (which is important if you are going to switch drivers!). The thin, plasticky coating doesn't have a bad aftertaste and I think this definitely helps quell nausea.

"I am always drawn to debut novels, just as I am always drawn to novels about twins, so this book really fits the exact type I like to read and I wasn't disappointed for a minute! Though the twins here, the titular Whiskey and Charlie are not overly much like my favorite literary twins (the Wakefields, of course), they do share some similarities with those beautiful Southern Californian girls. Whiskey (William) is the Jessica - he's more outgoing and adventurous whereas Charlie is the Elizabeth and is more reserved. The book, told through Charlie's perspective, shows that these twins have not been close in a long time. Charlie recalls his perpetual envy of Whiskey and by the opening of the book, the brothers are more like acquaintances than family.The book is structured around the two-way alphabet and works perfectly in unfolding both the past and present of the twins' relationship. From the very beginning, Whiskey lies in a hospital bed, so this makes for a very engaging hook (and yes, it is a bit DEAR SISTER # 7 (Sweet Valley High (Numbered Paperback)) - which is one of my SVH favorites!). The characters all feel completely real and the book is very well-crafted. There are tender moments as well as comical ones and it is a very enjoyable read. I just love it! The characters are so genuine that by the book's end, I must admit that I am not at all ready to say goodbye to them! What a strong debut!! I will definitely be keeping my eye out for Smith's next novel!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351TF324ZHO0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149260786X#wasThisHelpful","R351TF324ZHO0Z","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our most recent book club pick and the third one that I have selected to listen to rather than read. And I must say, the narratorâs skillful performance was without a doubt my favorite part of the book! She does a truly terrific job - especially with the wide variety of accents within this historical romance from the cultured English accents, along with the Scottish, French and Indian ones. All are quite convincing and genuinely pleasurable to listen to! I definitely plan on listening to more from this skilled performer!Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for this selection wanes considerably in regards to the actual book. Set in 1850s England, the narrator Miss Rebecca Ravenshore, is the lone survivor of her familyâs missionary life in India. When she returns to the home she hasnât seen since four years of age, she quickly discovers that another young woman has posed as he and has since passed on under some questionable circumstances. On top of which, her family home has been claimed by a distant (and of course handsome) relative! Itâs an intriguing premise, but it unfolds very slowly. The historical detail feels authentically researched and thereâs plenty there to prove that Rebecca is indeed the daughter of missionaries (if nothing else, her actions in the end prove that!). But Rebecca herself is not consistently likable - she seems overly naive and trusting considering her life experiences. And as for the romance, well that is far too predictable and rather disappointing. Much of the plot feels overly familiar to me, and while I am certain that I have never read this before, the entire time listening to it I had a very odd deja-vu sense of knowing exactly what would happen.The plot does hold one genuine surprise, though and it is one that sticks out of this book quite a bit for me... I am curious to see where our clubâs discussion will go, but I am very thankful for the skill of the narrator because otherwise I am quite certain that I wouldnât have finished this one at all!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35QN70PPRX8OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717869#wasThisHelpful","R35QN70PPRX8OP","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I would not have normally selected this novel were it not for the adorable St. Bernard on the cover - and even when it arrived, I was surprised that it was fiction as I had somehow gotten the impression that this was a memoir... But this Inspirational Fiction read is quite an entertaining and enjoyable novel. It is at times sweetly sad, but overall an uplifting read. At the heart of the novel is Lewis, a young St. Bernard, Lewis. Adopted by a family, it quickly becomes apparent that Lewis is special and has a knack for provoking the truth. But Alex, the young boy who is Lewisâ best friend, is sickly and when it turns out that he has allergies, the perfect solution reveals itself to have Lewis accompany widowed and elderly George on his cross-country, year-long tour of America in his RV while Alex undergoes treatment for his allergies.The journey is fun and moving in the ways that George and Lewis together are able to help the strangers they encounter. Though it is Christian fiction, there is more poetry quoted here than Scripture, so it is not an overly religious book. But it definitely deals in faith and handles it in a non-offensive way (I think the Lewis angle works well on many levels here). The characters are well drawn and all feel genuine. It may not always be the most believable book, but it is definitely an entertaining and sweet story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9AKUF0X48Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426791607#wasThisHelpful","R1B9AKUF0X48Q2","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience with Brewerâs writing and I must say that I have rather mixed feelings about this book. Stephen and his dad move in with the grandmother that Stephen has never met in a small Michigan town. Itâs evident that the town, much like Stephenâs own family, are going through some bad times. And whatâs more, the town seems to have a rather gruesome history with its own mythology of powerful Winged Ones who can bring prosperity but only at a blood price.While the premise of a small town with murderous secrets is hardly new or fresh, the book does move along at a fast pace. Stephenâs inner monologue - when it isnât too bogged down in self-pity and downright whining - can be pretty funny. But heâs the only character that feels developed. And while I am not sure if a sequel is planned, I hope that there is because this doesnât have a satisfying conclusion at all and there are many threads left hanging. The plot definitely holds some surprises, but even if there is a second book I donât think that I will go out of my way to read it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HWOXR8PSZMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062307886#wasThisHelpful","R9HWOXR8PSZMS","A1D5RCOILPC9LX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D5RCOILPC9LX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any book blurb that mentions twins almost inevitably ends up in my stack of books-to-be-read - though in this case, Julia and Ryan are fraternal twins (thanks Sweet Valley for making me only want to read about identical blonde girls, haha). But from the very first page, it is easy to get sucked into this debut novel which goes into why Julia is now known as Lucy and hasnât seen her brother for almost a year. The ending and main plot twist may not surprise all readers but there are other twists to the storyline that make this an engaging and fast-paced read. The violence makes this more appropriate for the older end of the YA readers and Julia/Lucyâs narration is engaging from the first page to the last. It is easy to keep reading this one when other tasks should be completed instead!

"I enjoy novels of the American West. After seeing the cover blurb in ""Crazy Mountain Kiss,"" that the story would be perfect for fans of Craig Johnson, I was sold.A member of the Madison River Liar and Fly Tiers club comes to a rented mountain cabin in order to work on his manuscript. Wanting to warm the cabin up, he checks the chimney and finds a Santa hat there. Then he climbs on the roof of the cabin and finds the body of a teenage girl wedged in the chimney.How could the teenager get into this spot? What caused her death? These are questions that on again off again private investigator Sean Stranahan is hired to find out.The story moves at a liesurly pace as we learn about the characters and life in the Montana mountains.The deceased, Cindy Huntington is well described. She seemed so full of life and ready for the happiness in her future that her untimely death hits the reader and the other characters hard.Stranahan keeps at his trade and discovers that there is an adult couples club that would rent the mountain cabin from the Forest Service. Sean begins interviewing the members of the club and comes across a group of wacky characters. Then he begins to get closer to the person responsible for Cindy's death.It is easy to see why there is a comparison to the work of Craig Johnson. One of the characters is a consultant for a modern TV show about the American West. The show has an American Indian as the sidekick to the sheriff and the sheriff himself, being a tall man who has to duck his head to enter rooms, good comparison to Johnson's TV show, ""Longmire"".The life of the characters is well portrayed but the action suffers and it is drawn out before Stranahan makes further headway into solving the crime.McCafferty is skilled with the character descriptions and tales of their adventures but I would have enjoyed it more if he got right to solving the mystery. In addition, some of the characters seemed to be right out of a Hallmark TV movie. However, ""Crazy Mountain Kiss"" is an enjoyable read and excellent for a book to read on a vacation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183M5BUR9JLZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670014702#wasThisHelpful","R183M5BUR9JLZC","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Beck (short for Rebecca)  is also Lana's best friend.The reader learns that Lana is a habitual liar so it's difficult to know when to believe her. There are questions about Beck's disappearance and that of another girl a few years before. Lana's reaction to these incidents don't seem to make her very upset. She comes across as a self centered and selfish woman. She is also hard to like.However, as the reader learns more about her past, feelings change. There are some surprises to the story and one of them had me wondering how it could be possible.Luke, although only eleven, seems to make Lana do his bidding and I found this unlikely.Overall, not many likable characters. The story does move fast but I wish there was more to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208VF3KXFM3QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476708231#wasThisHelpful","R208VF3KXFM3QO","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this fine novel which was nominated for the Anthony Award for the Best First Mystery Novel, a predator stalks and rapes law student Chloe Larson and escapes.12 years later, a string of murders has occurred in the Miami area. The killer is dubbed, cupid and the cupid killer. A policeman pulls a car over for a traffic offense and when the driver refuses to allow the author to check his trunk, a K-9 unit is called. The dog whiffs something. On popping the trunk, they find a dead girl with a missing heart. William Bantling demands a lawyer.He's brought before the court and prosecutor C.J.Townsend. Is Bantling the serial killer or a copy cat? Then, C. J. hears the man's voice and remembers it. Even though it's been 12 years, C.J. remembers the attack, the break-up of her relationship and her nervous breakdown.  She had moved to Florida, changed her name and passed the Florida bar exam. She's able to survive with drive and periodic visits to her analyst.When C. J. recognizes the voice she becomes more determined than ever, to make sure that the man who raped her and killed the woman in his trunk gets what he deserves. C.J. must walk a thin line between justice and retribution.This is a wonderful plot driven novel. C.J.Townsend is a first rate protagonist, sympathetic yet strong in her resolve. The author adds an interesting but somewhat predictable plot twist at the end which heightened the enjoyment.Film rights have been sold to Warner Brothers and John Wells Productions, the film is currently under development. I'm looking forward to the film.4 1/2 stars moving up to 5* for well written plot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28716NOPPN9I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXKAB12#wasThisHelpful","R28716NOPPN9I4","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don Winslow has created another edge of seat thriller with ""The Cartel."" I was totally captivated by the story and rate it among the best novels I've read this year.In a story that seemed so true that much of the action could have been taken from the pages of the newspaper, DEA Agent, Art Keller is up against Adan Barrera, the head of El Federation, the most powerful cartel. Barrera murdered Keller's partner and betrayed Keller's friendship.As I was reading the story, the news of El Chapo's escape from prison brought this story home with a wallop. In ""The Cartel,"" Barrera, like El Chapo"" breaks out of prison and resumes his active leadership of his cartel.We see the other cartels in action in most parts of Mexico and their unstoppable rise to power.Barrera and the leaders of the other cartels are utterly brutal. They think nothing of killing innocent women and children in horrendous manners. As their power grows, the cartels between to clash and a war between the crime families ensues. Neither the local police nor government forces seem able to stop their rise to power and the spread of their empires.The characters are colorful and well drawn. Anyone picking up this massive novel and expecting an easy read will be disappointed. Instead, it is a powerful expose of the Mexican cartels and the manner in which they become so powerful. Art Keller is an excellent protagonist, true to life, with flaws but heroic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HNC7RVNTDFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874996#wasThisHelpful","R39HNC7RVNTDFW","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel grabbed my attention with the concept of a serial killer who kills other serial killers.Make no mistake, Roy A.Teel, Jr. knows how to write a novel that is gripping and will keep the reader glued to the pages.The violence is graphic so not advised for under eighteen. It was actually more graphic than I care to read. I also felt that a number of circumstances were just too coincidental. One villain kidnaps the best friend of another person he's kidnapped and this new person happens to be a person of interest to another key character.The killings take place around the city of L.A. and the three main characters are well drawn and their motivation properly described and understandable.There were two early killings in which the main killer diverted from his or her subject of killings. One person is said to have been getting too close to the killer and another older man associated with someone who was evil but I didn't understand how. It may be me but I usually follow the trend of stories.I also felt that some paragraphs were overly long and when two people were speaking to each other, paragraph breaks would make it easier for a reader to follow who the speaker is.I enjoyed the pace of the story and killers being caught and made to pay for their crimes. It was also a change of pace when one of the protagonists gets involved in a menage a trois.Overall, an excellent story but more brutal and graphic than my usual choice in suspense and mysteries.I received a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322Q9OXWUO3X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988702509#wasThisHelpful","R322Q9OXWUO3X3","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I was being entertained by the story, ""Memory Man,"" I kept thinking how good a writer and storyteller David Baldacci is.This novel introduces a new protagonist, Amos Decker. He was a pro football player who suffered a massive hit on the helmet by another player. The helmet to helmet collision ended his career and caused an unexplained side effect - he never forgets anything.Decker went on to be a cop in Burlington and was very successful until a killer murder his wife and family - including his ten-year-old daughter. He resigned from the police department and from life. He ended up sleeping on the streets until he rebounded enough to live in a motel and start a private investigator business. Since he can't forget anything, he continues to see events of that night and it almost brings him to the brink of suicide.Over a year later, a homeless man confesses to the killing but when Decker gets to question him, he can't provide the small details of the crime.During this time, there is a mass killing at the high school. Decker ic called back to the job to help with the investigation.Are the two crimes related? If not, the odds of two horrific killings a year apart don't seem possible.With the homeless man set free, Decker and his old partner attempt to recreate the crimes to see who might be the killer.

"U.S. District Judge, Diane Manchester is abducted just prior to her determination on the case against a Colombian drug lord. Complicating matters is that Diane is age forty-three and eight months pregnant with her first child.Max Freeman, private investigator, and former Philadelphia cop, works for Diane's husband, Billy, a black lawyer from Philadelphia who prefers to remain behind the scenes, juggling law and investment work.No words are uttered by Diane's abductors. Her head is covered and she can't see  the people who are holding her captive.Officials are perplexed because there is no follow-up ransom demand. Since Diane was working on the case of the Columbian drug lord, Max speculates that it might have a connection with that.With funds and input from Billy, Max looks into Diane's prior cases. Billy gives Max the details of the most likely cases where Diane sent a person to prison and now that person's sentence is over and they might be free from prison and want a revenge kidnapping.The premise of the story is sound but Diane isn't permitted to talk to the people who abducted her, and they don't talk to one another in her presence.  Author Jonathan King fails to create a sympathetic character. Even though Diane is eight months pregnant and worried about her child, the reader will find it difficult to relate or sympathise with  her or her wealthy husband.One minor character, one of Diane's abductors, is a young woman and she feel remorse for abducting Diane.This character is sympathetic as we share her thoughts as Diane attempts to communicate with her about the baby.The middle section of the story was slow and the conclusion was a surprise, perhaps too much so without sufficient foreshadowing.  I enjoy the work of Jonathan King and will look forward to his next novel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FA1GOJGECU3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504001656#wasThisHelpful","R2FA1GOJGECU3I","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ""The Journal of Popular Culture,"" Scott R. Christianson writes about tough talk and wisecracks. ""...the hardboiled detective/narrator talks all the time to the reader. He talks tough and he talks smart but mainly - as the narrator of the story as well as the protagonist - he talks a lot.""As an example of the above, Robert Parker's wonderful P.I., Spenser, demonstrates in Parker's ""Stardust,"" published in 1990.Spenser is asked to protect a spoiled, temperamental TV star, Jill Joyce. She stars in TV's Fifty Minutes and has been filming the TV show from Boston.The story in ""Stardust"" seems realistic as we learn that someone has been harassing Jill and she demands protection. She shows that on the TV show she may be a star but off screen she's something else.When violence erupts and someone on the TV crew is killed, Spenser goes into action to find the killer.Jill drinks to excess and seems like a sex starved nymphomaniac, but underneath her outward persona, Spenser recognizes fear and vulnerability.He investigates her background and learns things that make him sad to see. How can someone who had to rise above misfortune gain the public spotlight? And, at what cost?There are lessons of endearment and loyalty that Spenser demonstrates to his own love, psychologist, Susan and we see the empathy Spenser shows for a number of people associated with Jill whose lives have also been shattered.For a dish of mystery topped with a flavoring of humor, this can be the main course.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZA82EV02PZ0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F4CFEK#wasThisHelpful","RZA82EV02PZ0M","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I was enjoying ""Dead Money Run,"" by J. Frank James, I associated the hard boiled character of Lou Malloy with Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade. The fact that Hammell was a former Pinkerton Detective helped him with creating realistic dialogue and that is what there is plenty of in this novel. I'm sure that if Humphrey Bogart was with us today, he could play the part of Lou Malloy on the big screen.Lou Malloy is released from prison after serving fifteen years for robbing a casino of fifteen million dollars. A few months prior to his release, Lou received a letter telling him about his sister's murder. As Lou later learns, his sister, Susan, was doing something honorable when she was tortured and murdered.The action packed story has Lou (think Sam Spade) taking one step at a time, eliminating gunman and getting closer to who was responsible for his sister's death.Lou has the good luck to team up with Hilary Kelly, a private eye, hired by the insurance company who paid the claim to the Indian Casino for the money Lou stole. Hilary is suppose to befriend Lou and have him lead her to the money but she falls for him and becomes his partner.Various criminals are after Lou and he is able to dispatch them with ease. (I'm still seeing Bogart with the gun and maybe blowing on the barrel of his gun as he shoots another goon.)There are a number of levels to the story. On one hand there is the family love Lou shows for Susan. She was only fifteen when he was sent to prison. He seems to feel an inner regret that he wasn't there to protect her. We also see the friendship and emotional connection between Lou and Hilary. Finally, there is the friendship between Lou and Crusher, Lou's powerful protector in prison and right hand man in this story.Overall, this is a gem of a story as if one of the classic hard boiled novels was recently found and released.Don't miss it.I received a free book for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SEYU8COTTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ7108G#wasThisHelpful","R18SEYU8COTTE","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ""Ruins of War,"" World War II history, a tormented serial killer and a determined military investigator combine for a satisfying and intelligent read.Mason Collins is a former Chicago homicide detective who was fired from his job, allegedly, for accepting kickbacks.He's assigned to Munich, Germany CID in 1945. The city is divided into military segments after the end of the war. Collins's first assignment is to view the victim of a murderer.  The action ratchets up as Collins gets an investigation unit working on the case and the killer selects his next victim.There's a snag when Collins' boss would rather go after a gang that was partially made up of U.S. deserters and there was a connection to the U.S. while the killer had murdered a victim who was initially unidentified.What particularly drew me to the story was the World War II setting and the vivid descriptions of Munich with bombed out buildings, multitudes of orphans, and many displaced persons. These DP's came from people who were freed from concentration camps, German and U.S. deserters, soldiers who came from counties where they were forced to fight for Germany such as Czechoslovakia and general criminals.Mason shows his tenderness in helping to feed orphans and in his desire to do justice and find the killer - at all costs and the reader relates to him and hopes for his success.The excellent descriptions of primary and secondary characters was another entertaining element to the story. The suspenseful story had me turning pages late into the night.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MY3195D1XCJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425278956#wasThisHelpful","R1MY3195D1XCJE","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Before going, they tell Lettie that there is one dangerous person who attends these gatherings, his name is Pilate and he enjoys inflicting pain..Pilate is a Charles Manson type character. He is crazy and enjoys hurting and tormenting others. He thinks that runaways, homeless people or travelers make good subjects of his violence since no one would miss them. He has a group of followers, the women prostitute themselves and turn over their paychecks to him and the men do his bidding, stealing and selling dope.There is quite a similarity between Pilate and Charles Manson. One of Pilate's early victims was a blond, pretty entertainer who Pilot mutilated and murdered. This event reminded me of Sharon Tate's murder by Manson. Pilate feels like a god who can do whatever he wants to a person without reprisal.I have read many crime novels and am happy to say that John Sanford has created a fresh plot with clean, dialogue that flows like a police training film. The secondary characters are also unique and create a desire in the reader - to learn what will happen with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNUPPQCLUWCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168796#wasThisHelpful","RGNUPPQCLUWCO","A16RAMIXBUHVKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RAMIXBUHVKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always enjoy Hollywood-based chicklit, as it's a bit like reading a People magazine - pure fun diversion. This book started out that way, with the main character Hannah, 'love child' of a famous and recently deceased Hollywood legend, accepting a job as a personal assistant to an up and coming star in order to make her bills, while her father's estate is sorted out. She's drawn to him but vows not to get involved with him, and then falls for a friend of his. Through treachery and misunderstandings, it soon becomes a love triangle of sorts (I'll not say much more so as to leave what little plot there is a surprise.) All of this is standard chicklit fare, and though not terribly original, if it had been pulled off better, could have been quite good.Unfortunately, the characters are just paper thin - more like descriptions of characters than actual people with real emotions. Hannah barely seems to grieve for her father, mentions her mother once and then never again, and apparently has no pre-existing life - no friends at all are mentioned other than those she meets on set in her new job. Her attraction to her boss is inexplicable once he reveals his true colors, and she literally jumps from being in love with one guy, to broken hearted, to in love with another one in a matter of hours. Neither guy comes off as worth all this effort. The story suffers from feeling rushed as well - a couple of times I went back a few pages to see if I'd missed a 'after a few weeks passed' or something like that, because things seemed to have changed so quickly. Her boss is saying 'what would I do without you' when she's been working for him for 12 hours, and there are other odd timing things too.So, there were some amusing moments here, and a promising setup, but it just didn't quite deliver.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34N5H6ZNVU3B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F027NCG#wasThisHelpful","R34N5H6ZNVU3B6","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who once worked with many individuals in the tech industry who would probably be categorized as Asperberger's, I really appreciated the 'voice' of this book. Told from the first-person perspective of Don, an Asperberger's (or Asperberger's- like) professor of genetics, this chronicles his attempts to find a wife, and the unexpected relationship he finds instead. He experiences many changes, and this book so accurately captures the strain this places on his worldview and perceptual framework. Along the way, it really comes to highlight how we all resist change, and the flow of life. Although Don is himself limited emotionally, the book is so well done that I really came to care for him. An interesting and different read...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Z7EFD1AQ4UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSBR9N6#wasThisHelpful","R16Z7EFD1AQ4UB","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful book for both those new to Buddhism and established practitioners, and it benefits a worthy cause too - all proceeds go to the Dongyu Gatsal Ning Nunnery, which the author founded and runs, in order to offer Tibetan nuns the same access to study and higher teachings that monks typically have.For those unfamiliar with Tenzin Palmo, she was born in London in 1943, and became one of the first Western women to be ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun. She first became known to Westerners through the book Cave in the Snow by Vicki Mackenzie (also a great read), which chronicled her 12 years living in a remote cave in the Himalayas, the last three of which were spent in strict meditation retreat.Into the Heart of Life is adapted from talks given by Tenzin Palmo in the years since she left her cave in 1988. The book is organized into nine topics, each delivering to-the-point teachings on a topic central to Tibetan Buddhist practice: Impermanence, Karma, or Cause and Effect, Creating Happiness, The Eight Worldly Concerns, Renunciation, The Six Perfections, Lojong and Bodhicitta, Faith and Devotion and Practicing the Good Heart.Tenzin Palmoâs warm and direct style makes this a valuable book for both established practitioners and those new to Tibetan Buddhism. She brings formal teachings to life by discussing them in modern terms. It isnât a formal introduction to Buddhism in that it isnât organized in a linear fashion beginning with the Buddhaâs life story or the Four Noble Truths. But because she speaks in such an accessible manner, someone new to Buddhism could definitely read it and benefit from itsâ wisdom. Those interested in Tibetan Buddhism will particularly appreciate the chapter on Lojong (mind training) and Boddhicitta. Jetsunma Tenzi Palmo is truly a treasure amongst contemporary teachers, and both her books and continued work to help nuns gain access to higher teachings is a gift to the world of Buddhism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22S9SJFL46GOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053YM092#wasThisHelpful","R22S9SJFL46GOX","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've waited until I owned this for a couple of months before reviewing it to make sure any issues weren't just a matter of me getting used to it. Alas, I had high hopes for this, but they haven't panned out (pun intended.) My first complaint is that it has no cover, and even with the automatic raking, I don't particularly want to look at cat litter, so I purchased the accompany tent-like Littermaid cover. This works OK, but is a hassle to work with when I need to replace the litter. The rake is also very loud when it runs, which in my house is not a huge problem because it is not close to where I sleep, but anyone in an apartment is probably going to be woken by this at night.However, a bigger complaint is that this isn't saving me time. I have one normal sized cat, but I have to empty the container twice a week, because the rake pushes in so much extra litter along with the 'clumps' so it fills up fast (and yes, I am using the Littermaid litter and yes, I am only filling it to the fill lines.) Then I also usually have to sweep up around the litterbox because so much litter spills out the sides when the rake operates.My biggest complaint though is that this has not reduced the odor. It does for the first day or so after changing the container, but by the time a few 'clumps' have been pushed in there, the carbon filter they tote doesn't seem to be doing much at all. So now I am sprinkling baking soda over the litter at least once a day (another hassle with the tent cover.) So all in all, though the autorake feature does technically work, it hasn't done the two things it advertises and that I bought it for - saving me time and reducing odor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TOS0POXTHK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097576MY#wasThisHelpful","R16TOS0POXTHK0","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In all my reviews, I've never written 'masterpiece', but I think this one might actually deserve it. To think I initially resisted reading this book, as it sounded too depressing! And in many ways it is depressing, but it is also very warm and real, and filled with moments of beauty and love. And this is exactly what the novel probes- the tragedy and pain of the human condition, and all the myriad ways we suffer, but also the moments of depth and beauty, that keep us going, and make life more than simply denial.As for the plot, this book mostly takes place in the 'underbelly' of society - amongst addicts, trauma survivors, gamblers, hustlers, and the mentally ill. Anytime a character arrives that seems like they might actually have it together, we quickly learn their ways of pretending, and of coping. The Goldfinch of the title is a painting, an extraordinary one whose whereabouts drive the plot of the book. Enough has been written about the plot, and honestly, it's better to go in not knowing too much, so you can let it unfold.  Just don't be put off by the description - this is so well-written and compelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAPAH57E0T6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAXFECK#wasThisHelpful","R1GAPAH57E0T6N","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really well-done, and it's a rare movie that my husband and I both actually liked, so that's saying something! Matthew McConaughey is almost unrecognizable in his role as a heterosexual cowboy who contracts AIDS in the still fairly early days of the epidemic (based on a real story.) Shunned by friends, and told he has a month to live, he researches his own alternative treatments, turns selling them in to a business, and ends up influencing the direction of AIDS treatment and research in his own way. Jennifer Garner is solid as a sympathetic doctor, and Jared Leto is brilliant as a transvestite fellow AIDS victim. It manages to be tragic, funny, gritty, and inspiring all at the same time.

"This movie does feature porn, though never full shots (as then it couldn't be rated R), so if that bothers you, stay away. The main character, played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt is addicted to porn, and to 'real' women too. He's a nightclub playboy with little in the way of other ambitions, who confesses his transgressions weekly at church. When he falls for Scarlet Johansson's character, he has met his match. She knows how to use sex to get him to do what she wants, and he quickly renounces his play boy ways. Their scenes together highlight all of the different sex/power games that young couples play, and it is quite entertaining (plus Scarlet is gorgeous in this.) Julianne Moore' plays an older, wiser woman (though still sexy) that helps Levitt's character begin to see he wants some deeper than either Scarlet or porn.

"This is definitely one of the better Amazon self-publishing options that I have read. The main character is a Hollywood publicist who ends up on a remote Alaskan island with walruses as part of helping film a charitable documentary for a client about the impact of global warming on walruses. She is of course smitten with the celebrity client, but finds herself strangely attracted to an obstinate and rude scientist she is forced to work with as part of the film. Of course this results in the requisite who-will-she-end-up-with romantic plot that pretty much all books of this type center around. What makes this semi-unique is the setting - I learned a lot about walruses, and about how global warming is impacting them and other creatures, as well as about celebrity charitable work. That might not sound that interesting, but the author is a pretty good writer, and knows how to dose it out well, so it comes off admirably. Entertaining and a little offbeat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FRV8M2VIQP7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007S313VW#wasThisHelpful","R1FRV8M2VIQP7N","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Three of them all vie for the attentions of newly outed Tanner, while his also gay friend Brent, initially stays in the closet, but eventually comes out himself and becomes a semi-rival. This film pokes fun at every high school stereotype, and in that sense may offend some, as it is a kind of post-politically-correct that seems to have become fashionable lately. It's mostly trite fun, but because of the subject matter, does become heartfelt and carries that off well enough. It's good-hearted and cute.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB0LJAG41GDFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8C3KVY#wasThisHelpful","RB0LJAG41GDFP","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful and layered novel, with a story that pulls you along and intrigues in its own right, coupled with deep questions about the nature of existence that reflect the Zen Buddhist themes at its heart. It shifts between Ruth (the character, not the author, but of course the shared name is part of the book's play with identity) and her life on a isolated Canadian island with her husband, and a journal from a teenager in Japan that has washed up on their beach. The journal shares the story of the girl's struggles with bullying, a suicidal father, and the one saving grace in her lonely life, a Zen Buddhist nun grandmother who is 104 years old. Along with the journal is a set of letters from a young WWII kamikaze pilot, also the girl's uncle.We move back and forth between these various stories, points in time, and points of view. In Zen poetry and literature, form mirrors content, pushing the boundaries of narrative perspective, and this novel does this beautifully, without ever feeling like a philosophy tract. It is both soulful and intellectual.

"This is so beautifully and skillfully written. Ursula returns again and again to the same life in pre-WWI England, each time meeting a different fate and demise, depending on slight shifts in her choices or events. I hesitate to summarize it this way however, because this is much like the descriptions I originally read, and that prevented me from ordering the book the first 10 times Amazon suggested it to me. I was afraid it would be too repetitious and tedious, and I look for enthralling reads, especially in the summer.I am so glad I finally gave in and bought this, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and was pulled in every second. The author has deftly structured this so that she never repeats anything - even though we read about the author's birth countless times, each time it is from a different character's perspective, and this always adds something new to our understanding. Ursula's family members remain the same in all versions of her life, so we become attached to them, as we become attached to Ursula. As Ursula gradually realizes what is happening, she begins to take control of her fate, and choose the outcome to some extent (or really, the 'theme' of the book, such as there is one, is to what extent we can or can't control the outcome, and what a desired outcome is anyway.) The different versions of her life read like brilliant short stories, each one pulling you in. Then in the next 'story', she changes one thing, and the rest of her life branches out in a new direction.It's all very hard to explain really - you have to experience it. It's not reincarnation, as she is in the same life in the same place and time period, and the larger historical events of WWI and WWII are the immovable backdrop that Ursula struggles to live against and within. You could say it's an exploration of how our own lives intersect with the larger world, and how much control each of us does or doesn't have over our fate, but this makes it sound more philosophical than it is. This isn't a theoretical book, it's an experiential one, and that's what makes it so great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBJ2SEKG027H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316176486#wasThisHelpful","R2QBJ2SEKG027H","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is part historical fiction, part contemporary chicklit, and I felt the former worked better than the latter. Grania is a Scottish-born sculptor who has left her boyfriend Matt and their NYC life after a personal crises (I don't want to give anything away by being too specific.) She returns to her parents in Scotland, and quickly meets a mysterious young girl from a neighboring estate. Her mother is alarmed and tells her there is a long, painful history between their 2 families. From that point on, the story moves back and forth between a telling of this history, and the contemporary story, both narrated by the little girl.The historical sections of the story worked well for me, particularly a section in London during and after WWI. It has a very Downton Abby feel to it, and the characters in this part were the most well-written and believable. The contemporary story was a real problem for me though. The plot is absurd, propelled forward through miscommunications and coincidences that were just too contrived for my taste. In addition, the dialogue between the NYC characters, and between Matt and Grania, felt very fake - she just could not nail their tone or wording at all (Matt says `real'  and `sure' and `buddy' a lot, as in `I am real sorry Grania' or `That is a real shame buddy') - know any 30-something New Yorkers who talk like that?)The Scottish setting is beautiful however, so there were definitely many parts of this novel I enjoyed, and I wasn't bored with it. So it's a good read if you like both historical fiction and relationship oriented fiction, but expect some dissonance in the contemporary sections.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P025AEJBMRYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EDOU2K#wasThisHelpful","R3P025AEJBMRYS","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read a lot of chicklit as escapism, but I don't think I have read this author before. This was a reasonably entertaining light read, but I didn't find anything terribly original in it. The plot is basically a standard love triangle - it's the week before Emily's wedding to Grant, and her ex Ryan shows up trying to win her back. Most of the book takes place at the New England resort where the wedding is scheduled, and there is a sub-plot of drama between the bride and groom's families. Obviously I don't want to give away the ending, but part of the problem for me is that I wasn't really happy with Emily's decision - the emotional trajectory to get her there wasn't convincing to me, so the ending felt a little contrived. But certainly as a chicklit/relationship/beach read this is an OK choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FBQ0DFCTU6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQTLA76#wasThisHelpful","R23FBQ0DFCTU6H","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was reluctant to invest in another alien-takeover series, but this one surprised me. The title refers to the stages - waves - in an alien invasion that at this point appears to have knocked out the majority of the human population. At least this is how it seems to Cassie, one of the few survivors, who has become a hardened warrior over the course of watching her family and friends die in the prior waves. We learn gradually of her past and the prior waves as the narrative unfolds, most of which takes place in real-time as Cassie struggles to find and save her younger brother in a Mad Max type world. She doesn't know who to trust and neither do we, and this keeps things interesting, and allows for a subtle but sophisticated exploration of what it means to be human.

Some of the words from the introduction that my 7-year old did not know: 'spatial orientation', 'stationary', 'alternatives', 'beneficial'. Considering that most girls start gymnastics pretty young (as the author herself did), this is a little confusing - if this is a book for beginning gymnasts, the language should be such that a 6-8 year old can understand it.

It is well-designed from a safety perspective for our aged children (7-9) - the bumper under the slide holds it in place against the pool.

It is a little small for teens and adults, so if that's what you are looking for, you probably need something else.

"All 3 of my kids (7 year old boy/girl twins and an eight year old) really enjoyed this movie, and my husband and I were mostly entertained too (always a plus in kids' movies.)

They have to team up for a chance to get back in, and learn all sorts of lessons about teamwork etc. along the way.Most kids won't get the college jokes but that's OK because there's enough going on to keep them entertained, and the college jokes are meant to engage the adults accompanying them.

I do feel that the scare scenes in this one are a bit scarier than in the first film, and that without little 'Boo' (the very young child trapped in the Monster world in Monsters Inc.) this isn't quite as charming a film, and also not as suitable for the very young (ages 2-4 may be frightened, it will depend on the child.) I also think that as a prequel/sequel it didn't show any spectacular originality that would have lifted it to 5 stars in my opinion. So it's a solid, 4-star, entertaining family film in my book - not a classic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5O1NL9RNOYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUPOY#wasThisHelpful","R2K5O1NL9RNOYB","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fresh and wonderful book for introducing children to Buddhism, or for deepening their understanding. It features seven stories from the daily life of a modern, Western Buddhist family. In each chapter, the parents weave a Buddhist lesson into the family's discussion, helping the children to see its' relevance to their own lives.For example, in the first story, the children, Alex and Brianna, both elementary-aged, are playing outside and do not want to come into the house to do their homework. ""I wish we could play all day long and all night too!"" they cry. 'Mama' lures them in by promising that once they have done their homework, she will tell them a story ""about a father who forced his son to play all the time.""The son in this case is Buddha, and Mama tells the children the first part of the Buddha's life story, in which his father the King tries to shield him from all pain and knowledge of sickness, old age, or death. The king prohibits any sign of suffering within the palace grounds, and fills the young prince's life with play and pleasure. Eventually, of course, the prince learns the truth and is moved to seek the true end of suffering for himself and all beings.Other stories are more practice oriented, such as the title story 'In the Garden of Our Minds.' Alex and Brianna have both had a rough day, and are grumpy and out of sorts. Mama invites them to sit down with her and do a simple 'Breathe In, Breathe Out' practice to quiet their minds. She then talks to them about the 'seeds of the mind', and how to make choices that cultivate the seeds of calmness, compassion, and peace, rather than the seeds of anger, ignorance, or fear.The stories and lessons are definitely Mahayana Buddhist in content and style, but because they are dealing with introductory teachings, I feel this book is appropriate for anyone of any Buddhist lineage, or for anyone who is interested in introducing children to Buddhism. For example, in the final story, 'A Visit with Rinpoche', the family attends a dharma talk with a Tibetan Rinpoche, and he explains bodhisattvahood. While the bodhisattva path is a Mahayana one, and not as prominent in Theravada Buddhism, the focus here is on mindfulness and compassion as a way of developing bodhisattva attributes. These themes are such that any Buddhist could adapt them for their children, and any spiritual seeker of any faith could use them as the foundation for a meaningful discussion with their children.As for age range, this book is geared towards elementary-aged children, I would say 6-10 or so, although children older or younger may enjoy it too. In the Buddhist tradition of facing truth directly, some of the stories do discuss death, and in one case violence - the story of the finger-hacking villain Angulimala, who is transformed by the Buddha's compassion. I felt these themes were handled appropriately for my own children, ages 7 and 8 (who loved the book overall), but parents should decide for themselves whether their children are ready for these themes.The Appendices to the book include a glossary, as well as suggestions for discussing the stories and introducing children to practice. Part of the profits from all sales will go to the Tibetan Nuns Project and 84000 - Translating the Words of the Buddha.Overall a great offering, and highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBTSRLR7IDLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098379846X#wasThisHelpful","R3RBTSRLR7IDLC","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike many other YA dystopian trilogies, the final novel in this one didn't disappoint. It certainly went in a different direction from what I expected, but as I accepted this, I realized the beauty of its trajectory. This is not simply a novel about a romance triangle, nor is it just an updated version of Farenheit 451. It combines themes of social rebellion (and the complexity of this) with themes of cultural repression, and then throws in a nice romance triangle too. In this book we move to 3 narrators - Ky, Cassia and Xander, and this adds a lot of depth. It's to the author's credit that this doesn't become too confusing. Overall, well worth the reading time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1796NIUE0LDIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FEFDFQ#wasThisHelpful","R1796NIUE0LDIT","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like where this story is going - so often dystopian trilogies fail to follow through on the promise of the worlds they introduce in the first book. In this case, I feel as if the world the author created has gotten more interesting. I also like the narration alternating between Ky and Cassia. I don't want to give too much away in terms of plot, but in this book they both escape Society and for part of it are searching for each other in the wilds. Once they find each other, they have to make difficult decisions about what to do next. The literature and art themes are continued and magnified in this book, and really trigger some interesting insights about the nature and purpose of language, art, and culture. That aspect of this trilogy is really what lifts it above the fray in my view. I usually don't enjoy the overly dramatic romantic plots, but I don't mind it in the case of this one, because poetry is the primary means through which the romance plays out.My only complaint is that I felt the pacing in this book got a bit slow, so I docked a star for that. Looking forward to the final installment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF2R9J024GTN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052RE4MQ#wasThisHelpful","RF2R9J024GTN4","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family and I enjoyed this more than I thought we would. I had heard it was a bit dark, and so was concerned my 8 and 6 year olds would find it too scary, but it was fine for them. It is basically a `prequel' to the Wizard of Oz, although you (or your kids) don't need to have seen that to follow this.  James Franco plays a traveling magician who is swept up into a tornado (or dream, depending on your interpretation) and lands in Oz, where through a circuitous series of events, he ends up as the Wizard. Dorothy and gang don't figure in this story, though both the wicked witch (Mila Kunis) and the good witch (Michelle Wiliams) do. The special effects are great, and the story, although not terribly inventive, carries along well enough. Overall, it's a good family film - perhaps a bit too dark for the preschool set, but elementary age and up should enjoy it. Let go of your attachments to the original Wizard of Oz, and just enjoy this for the performances and special effects, as an entertaining family film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6OQTRQI9EY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC7N9NS#wasThisHelpful","R1B6OQTRQI9EY1","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was an excellent movie with great performances, and particularly liked that it was something different. Bradley Cooper earns the praise he received for this role, playing a man with mental health issues returning home after being institutionalized, and trying to win his wife back and start a new life. Jennifer Lawrence is even better as a young widow with stability issues herself, who manipulates him into participating in a dance competition with her.  Every scene between them is spot on in tone, dialogue and depth. The supporting cast is excellent and entertaining as well. It manages to mix poignancy and humor with dark truth, and creates an entertaining and even heartwarming story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK72NM3LJZXN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL68QVQ#wasThisHelpful","RK72NM3LJZXN6","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First what I like: I like the idea of this book a lot - a bioterror plot with the clues centered on Dante's Inferno and related history. It provides a good setting for the kind of symbology and history that Dan Brown does best. I also liked the focus on the world's growing population, as I think it is something that should get more attention and perhaps this book will spur some conversation.The problem for me (and it's a big one) is that I just got bored too often while reading. Dan Brown of course has always had the tendency to go off on historical tangents, and to lead into them with ridiculous plot setups. I can forgive all of that if it's actually interesting. In this case, I just got bored with a lot of it. And the action plot and characters didn't compensate enough to re-engage me. By the end I was reading just to finish, not because I had to know what happened.So I'm actually being pretty generous with 3-stars, because I do like the idea and theme. I just wish it had all been better executed!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADIUKQ1Q9YDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXIZ4TQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ADIUKQ1Q9YDM","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a standalone chick-lit novel, I actually think this might be quite good. Unfortunately, as a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada, it's not. There is very little of Miranda Priestly (the devil made famous by Meryl Streep's movie portrayal), and the 10-year time lapse in Andrea's life doesn't quite work. Andrea and Emily (Miranda's other assistant in the book) are now best friends, and at the start of the novel Andrea's about to marry Max, a character she didn't yet know in the first book. Her boyfriend (Alex) and friend (Lily) from the first book do return eventually, but are not main characters.The story itself centers around Andrea's first year of marriage to Max, her doubts about it, and what happens. I can't say much more without spoilers, but I will say that where it all ends up left me a bit shocked and bereft. I had been rooting for a different outcome - not really a good thing in a chick-lit novel, as these are supposed to be about entertainment and happy endings. This wasn't quite a happy ending to me - that's all I will say.However, this book did keep me reading. I wanted to know what happened, I was attached to the characters, so in that sense it earned 3 stars. Let go of reading this as a true sequel, and just enjoy it as chicklit, and you may enjoy it more than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ZWWN2YU307G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A285UVY#wasThisHelpful","R32ZWWN2YU307G","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely children's book with a non-denominational and gentle spiritual undertone, especially for girls. It's an introductory chapter book with some black and white pictures, and I would say it is best for ages 5-10 or so  - the younger end of this age spectrum would need to have it read to them, but by age 8 or so, most of today's children will be able to read it themselves (both my 7 and 8 year old daughters read it themselves.) It centers on Betsy, a young girl who wants to play football with the boys in her neighborhood. They don't want her to play, but in her dreams she visits 'the golden room' and receives inspiration and advice for how to deal with them. She also receives clues that at first she can't discern, but that in a situation with the boys that arises the next day prove to be a tips on how to help heal one of the boys when he's injured. This event turns things around for Betsy, and helps her realize she may have other gifts that she can share. This book is meant to be the first in a series of books featuring Betsy and her energy healing/spiritual lessons, so I look forward to more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RURB7RBL4SI8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BANJN18#wasThisHelpful","RURB7RBL4SI8J","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie was a big hit with my family (husband and 3 kids - 8-year old girl, 6-year old boy, 6-year old girl.) Part of the appeal is that it is one of the few animated films that seems equally targeted to girls and boys - there are both a main girl and boy character, and just a tad of romance, but not so much for this to be a 'married happily ever after' princess type story. The nature animation is stunning, as is the view of the fairy world, and the human world seen from the fairy perspective. I loved the story (tho have not read the book so can't compare) and felt it was all carried off very well.

"I have read most of the YA dystopian trilogies that have come out in the last few years, and this one captured me more than I thought. I had originally held off on buying it, as the romantic looking cover and marketing description made me think it would be mostly teen romance fare (not my favorite.) But the world created here is interesting, and truly a magnification of certain trends in our current society - as the best dystopias are. The completely 'wired' homes, the tablets each society member carries (Prozac Nation anyone?), the faith in data and social engineering - it is possible to see how this kind of society might evolve from the fear created after a major catastrophe (we hear little about what precedes the creation of this one, other than references to 'the warming.') As for the 3 main characters - all teens, 2 boys and girl and yes, there is a kind of love triangle created - they are interesting enough. My main complaint with this first novel is that I didn't get enough of a sense of why they each did what they did, particularly Cassia, which is a real problem since she is the main 'voice' of this book. But the premise and story are compelling enough for me to want to read the rest, so that is mostly a win.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KEDJTHEQ5Y8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GSZZKG#wasThisHelpful","R3KEDJTHEQ5Y8A","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pema Chodron is a master at presenting teachings in a simple and accessible way, so that anyone can read her books and connect with them. The only potential downside is that it's possible to be deceived by the simplicity and overlook the depth of wisdom actually offered. In the case of this book on meditation, it begins with very basic, easy to follow instructions on getting started with a meditation practice focused on the breath. If you are looking for a straightforward little book to help you begin meditating, this is a great one (and Pema offers many meditation CDs that you can use for guidance as well.)As this book progresses though, it offers many more meditation approaches, and insights that will be useful even to those who have meditated for a long time. Sections 2, 3 and 4 are devoted to 'Working with Thoughts', 'Working with Emotions', and 'Working with Sense Perceptions', and in each she invites us to actually use these as 'objects of meditation' - to invite them into our meditation and work with them as the foundation for our practice, rather than judging them as 'bad' and trying to push them out. This 'friendliness' as she puts it, really changes everything, and offers us the potential for deep understanding and healing. She offers many personal stories, and anecdotes from students, to support how powerful this can be.In the final section of the book, 'Opening Your Heart to Include Everything', Pema connects meditation to the awakening or enlightenment process. This is perhaps the most 'Buddhist' section in the book, although really I feel anyone of any faith interested in spiritual meditation will find much value here (as with most of Pema's books, this one is not targeted to those who define themselves as 'Buddhist'.) Pema offers insight into how to work with our biggest challenges in life as objects of meditation, and even to view them as opportunities for enlightenment. She discusses the role of belief in practice, and how to examine the 'firmness' we find in our minds whenever we are gripping a belief as reality. She discusses working with 'groundlessness', and the way of the boddhisattva, or as she defines it, 'becoming a completely loving person.'So overall, this is a great little book for anyone interested in learning to meditate, or needing to break through barriers in their own meditation practice. If you have already read a lot of Pema's book there may not be anything new here, but as always it is well done and has a lovely transmission behind it. If you are new to her work, and certainly if you are new to Buddhism, this book is a wonderful place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STLYSQE8GR80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2BYPMY#wasThisHelpful","R2STLYSQE8GR80","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neither my husband or I have read the Jack Reacher books, so we watched this purely as a standalone action/mystery movie, and we enjoyed it. Cruise is riveting and believable as the aloof, intelligent Reacher with a mysterious past and semi-maniacal dedication to truth. The movie plot held our attention - it begins with a sniper picking off 5 people, seemingly at random, and leaving enough clues that he is quickly caught. However, as Reacher investigates, things become cloudier, and we aren't sure who is behind the shooting or why. The twists are revealed at the perfect pace - fast enough to keep you intrigued, but slow enough that you keep wondering if it's going to twist another direction. My only complaint - which is a common one for me - is the violence levels. I'm ok with a gritty story, and violence that is a necessary part of the plot, but some of if here just bugged me, such as the scene of a man trying to chew off his own fingers, or the one where a young woman is killed for knowing too much. Both could have been briefer and less graphic, and played the role they needed to in the overall plot. I assume they were part of the book(s) and they were trying to be true to this, but in my opinion it's time for Hollywood to ask some tough questions about the violence they portray and how they portray it, and to cut the details when it's an option. It's all gotten way to glamorized.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJUF4X8DT8DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUCW54Q#wasThisHelpful","RJUF4X8DT8DU","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18HHKM6WGEF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Sentey Artix Headset is Ah-mazing!  I have never had anything like this.  It is plugged into your USB port to bring you an unrivaled audio experience. It has volume control as well as vibration control, which makes it the ultimate gamerâs headset as well as the best for listening to every dynamic of a song.The thing that I love the most, besides the uber-clear sound quality, is the vibration.  It enhances the sound of the bass making it a deeper, more booming sound.  This is a particularly good thing for gamers, who will have a more realistic sound in a first-person game.  This is extreme definition stereo sound with an integrated subwoofer.There is a volume controller on the headset as well as some really cool-looking LED lights that can be turned on to give them an other-worldly look.  I love that the ear cups completely cover my ears.  This makes it easier to wear my glasses and earrings.  Other headsets press against my ears making wearing my glasses almost painful.  I almost always had to remove my earrings before Artix.  Not only that, but this headset doesnât sit on your head like other ones.  The headset has a strap that sits on your head without making it feel like a hard piece of plastic resting on your skull.The microphone stays out of the way until youâre ready to use it.  Tucked into the left headphone, the microphone folds down to rest next to your mouth without ever touching your face.  Talk your way through the latest video game or to a friend while youâre chilling at the beach, but when you donât want your microphone in the picture, itâs gone with the flip of your finger.  The cord is braided nylon and them covered for protection in a plastic tube.  The cord is 7.21 feet long!While the price is more than affordable, Artix is not for your kids.  The Artix is for YOU!  Exquisite quality sound.  Game and/or music vibration and deep bass.  Comfort.  I only wish that they came with their own case to stow away safely from harm.  Youâre going to want to keep this baby for yourself.

"The Bright Therapy Trident SR11A LED Skin Care System treats three different skin complaints: acne, aging, and uneven skin tone or skin discoloration.  Use of the red and infrared lights helps to activate skin cells and to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

The blue lights help to kill bacteria that causes acne while helping to reduce inflammation.  And, finally, the green lights can be used to help improve the look of skin with hyperpigmentation - freckles, sun damage, and age spots.

"The autumn weather is starting to get cooler, not where I am in Florida (kinda), but just go with me.  All that cold weather and dry heat and going in and out of doors takes it toll on your skin.  Particularly the skin on your face.  Dry weather makes your face dryâ¦and with more visible wrinkles, fine lines, and aged.Try something new this fallâ¦derma e Natural Skincare.  Family owned and operated for over 30 years, derma e has pioneered the development of vitamin-rich, high-performance antioxidant skincare solutions.  Their award-winning line features doctor-developed, consumer-tested, and clinically-tested face care, body care, and treatment products that are free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil and petrolatum.  They are also cruelty-free, gluten-free and 100 percent vegan.Youâd think with products like this that derma e would be one of those expensive department store brands, but youâd be wrong.  You can fight aging from the comfort of your very own local Walgreens, Whole Foods Markets, ULTA Beauty, and CVS.  derma e can be found in over 16,500 retail stores in the USA.  They even care about the environment with their manufacturing and operations, which are offset 100% by wind power.I will fight aging with derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate CrÃ¨me, which helps to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, leaving skin soft, smooth, and supple.  Itâs made for all skin types, so it doesnât matter if you have dry, oily, or even combination skin like me.  This is a fairly fragrance-free cream moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling soft and young-looking.  I use it on my freshly-washed face both morning and evening.  It works well on my neck as well.So while Iâm protecting my skin from a little extra time in the sun (since itâs not as hot as an over this time of year), you can fight aging skin from the dryness of colder air and from running the heater.  I recommend you check out all of the derma e products, which include Derma E Firming Moisturizer, DMAE, Alpha Lipoic, C-Ester, 2 Ounce, derma e Hyaluronic Acid Day CrÃ¨me, 2-Ounces, and derma e Hyaluronic Acid Night CrÃ¨me, 2-Ounces.Iâm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5NE7C6JHTZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00021KD2C#wasThisHelpful","R1N5NE7C6JHTZW","AWZRUTD8V7SUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZRUTD8V7SUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 4.5 X 3.75 inch bi-fold wallet (when closed) is a typical men's wallet with RFID blocking technology.  I don't have the ability to test the RFID blocking, but other reviews state that it really does work.  This is a lovely leather wallet with a light leather smell.  The larger ""cash"" area has two lengthwise pockets to keep cash, receipts, or whatever you like to keep in that section.  When the wallet is open, there are ""credit card"" pockets on each side, but on the left side, there is a fold down section that blocks the view of cards that you don't want to be seen by prying eyes.  In that fold down section, there is an area for you to put your driver's license for easy viewing without having to remove it.

"I really love this Essential Oil Diffuser.  I've been using it every night since I got it to diffuse essential oil that's been helping me sleep.  The diffuser lasts a full night of sleep (8+ hours) or a full work day when running on the lower setting.  I haven't run it on high at night.  It's stylish with the woodgrain-look, but it's not wood.  You won't need to worry about wood damage.  It's easy to wipe down and keep clean.  I highly recommend this diffuser.Three recommendations:  #1 - Put a ""fill line"" inside the diffuser so that you don't have to add a 100 ml cup that I have to fill 3.5 times to get the diffuser full.  #2 - The instructions say that the diffuser uses 250 ml, but the Amazon page says 350 ml.  #3 - There is nothing that says how long the diffuser is supposed to run.

"This has got to be one of the coolest lights that I've ever seen.  Plugged into your wall, it has an on/off switch for regular use as a night light or when you just need low light.  We keep it in the kitchen so my son can use it when he gets up at 3:30 AM to go to work so he's not lighting up the whole apartment and waking us up.But, during a power outage, unplug this light and put the clip on the plug.  The clip stays nicely on the flexible neck of the light when it's not in use, so you won't lose it.

"I have mixed feelings about the mascara, but part of that may be because I already have long, thick, black lashes. What I've found is that that it definitely makes my lashes look longer, but it also makes them look thinner by grabbing and clumping them together. So while I'm able to get longer-looking lashes with it, it does make them look somewhat sparse.If you have short lashes that are light, I think the results would be quite dramatic with the mascara. But if you already have lashes that are thick, it may just make them look longer and less thick.Probably the nicest thing about the mascara--barring that you cry while you're wearing it! ;)--is that it does wash off rather easily. I use soap and water to remove it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M81PC05VS1SB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126RXSM6#wasThisHelpful","R1M81PC05VS1SB","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Due to bad allergies, I have to make my own chocolates, which I do by melting chocolate chips and putting them in silicone molds. This set was on my radar late last year when people started reviewing it on YouTube.It's really a lot of fun, and encourages people of any age to be creative and try new things. I've used Rice Krispies, the insides of dried figs, and jam, for example.There are a few things I would recommend during use. First, the dispenser is nice and can keep the work area cleaner, but you may want to melt a lot more chocolate at once. I melt it in a bowl instead. By setting out aluminum foil, you can keep your work area clean and even easily clean chocolate off the aluminum foil (never put it in the microwave!) to eat or re-melt. Cleanup overall of chocolate is tough and messy. I run hot water and wipe it off whatever it's on (from spoons to bowls) with a paper towel before it starts hardening much.The only thing negative I can say about the set is that the yellow molds aren't as neat and chocolate bar-looking (I don't think) as the red ones. They're also a bit too tall. Additionally, I wish the plastic inserts for filled chocolates were silicone, like the main pieces in the set, as they may not stand up well to repeated use.Overall, though, this is a really fun set that encourages creativity, and sharing. I only wish the chocolates took as long to eat as they did to make! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KO8K8B0MHCL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNAGN7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1KO8K8B0MHCL2","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cat loves this canned food, and took to it immediately. While I can't vouch for the taste, it smells like chicken, and doesn't have a gross cat food smell like so many cat foods do.The texture is mostly very finely grained, with a decent amount of moisture/broth. She eats it mostly by lapping it up rather than biting and chewing it.It's also really nice seeing that the first four ingredients (""chicken, chicken broth, chicken liver, pork broth"") are meat-based, and that it's grain-free.

It clumped well and coated nicely. The container size was enough for one normal-sized box filling, so it lasted a week for one cat.The biggest difference I noticed was the weight.

(She's the type of cat where I have to keep bags of treats out of reach, or risk a chewed-open package!)I use them as rewards for teaching her tricks, and they're a great motivator for her since she's a food-motivated cat.One thing I would caution is that if you have a younger cat, the pieces are quite large.

"_Becoming Maria_ presents the story of the girl who would grow up to become the beloved character Maria on Sesame Street. As a child who grew up watching Sesame Street, as many people did, I felt I knew her. I even erroneously believed she was married to her Sesame Street husband, Luis, in real life, which made her character seem even more real.Included in the book are memories of Christmas, camp, the neighborhoods she was raised in, her father's drunken rages, and her mother's decisions to always go back to him. Other memories include her brother's severe asthma, and a trip to Puerto Rico--one of the few pleasant memories recalled. One of the nicest things I noticed was how much teachers believed in her and helped set her on a path toward acting. I wish this had been touched on a bit more concretely, as it is helps show what an influence teachers can have on children, especially those in dysfunctional family situations. It also would have been nice to know what they were seeing in her that led them to believe she would be a good actress.The book is written in first-person, from the age perspective of Manzano progressively through time. This makes the beginning a bit difficult to follow, as the author struggles with discerning who the girl Aurea is who lives with her family, or realizes that she has as many fingers as toes. On some occasions, the text almost comes across as a child's stream-of-consciousness. On occasion, I was stumped as to the age of the narrator at the time events took place, though I did greatly appreciate it being written in chronological order (from childhood to around age 20), as this can help a bit with orientation in time. Some of the stories are quite interesting, but the book is written in a way that even those that are interesting are told in the same manner as those that aren't. There's no real rise and fall of action, but rather a steady relation of stories. I personally would have liked to have seen the more interesting stories fleshed out a bit more. The book also would have benefited from moments of joy. Instead, it's mostly a progression of melancholic memories; at minimum, the tone has that quality to it.Incidentally, Sesame Street is not mentioned but in the very end of the book, when the author sees it on TV, and then goes on an audition.I could go into a lot of detail on content that some parents may find controversial or objectionable, or that some sensitive young readers may, but will just quickly list a few (there are more): drug use, alcoholism, strong language, child abuse, and spousal abuse. Because of the topics, I personally felt it was more a coming-of-age memoir suitable for adults. Not only due to its content, but also due to the writing style, I would personally recommend it more for adults or teens than its targeted age bracket. That being said, it could be of great encouragement to any kids in similar family situations, as it may give them hope that they are still important, and capable of great things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UEU2JFDV49X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545621844#wasThisHelpful","R11UEU2JFDV49X","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice towel that is also advertised as a pet blanket, and my cat uses it as a blanket. It's a good blanket for her size (she's about 10 1/2 pounds). I like how the taupe color has a paw print so that it's not pet-specific. It's also a nice, neutral color.The microfiber is a bit difficult to explain, but it has a grip to it--so it's not really super-soft, but is more of a texture that grabs and holds on to things. For example, if I lightly brush my hand over it, I can feel it grabbing at my skin. So, used as a blanket, it has a nice habit of grabbing on to debris and keeping it there. That being said, if used as a towel, it definitely has a front and back to it, with the back lacking the texture of the front.Overall, it's a great little pet product that has more than one use, and it's a nice-sized blanket for cats!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6IBREX1KRFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QOBTBO#wasThisHelpful","R1D6IBREX1KRFR","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got my printer in January 2013, and have been using these since the sampler cartridge ran dry, and have been so happy with the combination that I helped a friend get the printer last year. When trying to find a new printer/ink combination, I didn't want anything fancy, and wanted the least expensive way of printing. It seems so many printer companies sell you an inexpensive printer, then ""get"" you with the ink. The best solution I could find was a Canon ImageClass LBP6000, along with getting these generic toner cartridges.Each cartridge lasts so long, I tend to miscalculate when I'll need a new one! To make it stretch even more, I often go into the printer settings to make the toner lighter, because it's still very crisp. Even when the toner looks like it's running down, I typically get a significant number of pages printed afterward, by removing the cartridge and shaking it to redistribute the toner. (I shake it over the sink, as the toner sometimes shakes out a bit.)I've never used official Canon toner in my printer, other than the small sample one it came with, and have had no problems. I've always used these.I received the product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. That being said, please rest assured I have been using this product for quite some time, including other cartridges I got on my own prior to the complimentary one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEOKCLR5Z7R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VHP3SO#wasThisHelpful","R3SEOKCLR5Z7R5","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The possibilities are pretty limitless with what you can attach this camera to. If you don't like the thought of the sticky mount, it's light enough to attach via masking tape (although this can cover the controls, it's still usable)--although, I've only done this on things that are low enough to the ground that the camera won't get damaged if it falls. You can also purchase separate, more secure, attachments, such as one for a car and helmet/head.There are some things worth noting when deciding if this camera is right for you. Following are some things I was a bit disappointed in. There's no video on the recorder, at all. There's no viewfinder, no playback, nothing. While this is understandable for most applications, especially since it's an action camera and this no doubt reduced its size and weight, it still would be nice to have this on it so that a separate viewing device isn't always necessary. When filming by holding the camera, I feel like I have to be looking at three things at once--what I'm filming, the viewfinder, and the camera! The remote viewer is what you can use for a viewfinder, as well as a very simple to download app (which is nice for a larger view).Unfortunately, there's also no audio playback. To hear the audio captured, you'll have to transfer the file to an outside device, such as a computer, or plug it in via USB and watch it off the card that way.The camera view can sometimes lend a fish eye view to the recording--i.e., some distortion can take place.The controls are not intuitive. While I tried to get the hang of it right out of the box, I ended up having to read the included manuals and online helps before starting. For example, the few buttons on the devices have multiple functions, most of which aren't labeled.While I've listed mostly negatives, that's just because the other things you can learn about the camera are already listed in the product description. These are things to consider that may not be so obvious.As for the quality of the film and audio output, both are really good. The camera does what it claims, and since it's so light and small it's really not difficult to attach it to various things--I've even put it on a pet collar, and harness!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115RB4M1C696L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CO9X4#wasThisHelpful","R115RB4M1C696L","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun Thomas the Train toy for young fans, and a nice spin on the old popper vacuum toys of yesteryear--with the option of floor hands-on ""car"" play, as well! The wheels, when moved, force a circle to pop up, sending a ball (sometimes) flying within the clear body of Thomas. Despite being clear, Thomas still looks like himself with his trademark grey face. As for details, the handle even creatively looks like a train track!There are two things I think would have made Thomas even better. First, there just aren't really enough balls inside Thomas for a lot of popping action. It would be more fun if the whole base were filled with balls; as they are now, they fill less than half. Still, the faster he goes, the more Thomas will pop. Second, the handle attaches with screws (included) and a screwdriver (not included). I was hoping that it would just snap in and out so that it would be easier to switch the way the toy works.It's really nice to see a toy like this that is creative, yet doesn't need batteries! And it's a fun spin on a good, old-fashioned toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MICCHMSBZEDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYL9BFS#wasThisHelpful","R1MICCHMSBZEDE","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an amazing laptop that I use pretty much on a daily basis, often for hours at a time. It's compact and light, and it has features you wouldn't expect to see in such a small computer. And it boots up so quickly! I clocked it at 10 seconds, even after getting all the programs I needed installed.One of the first things I noticed when using it was that it has two full-size USB ports, one on each side, which is extremely convenient for attaching whatever you might need--especially since it has no optical drive.The touchscreen works well and is very responsive. It's nice to have the option of a touch/track pad, touchscreen, or even adding on a mouse so you can navigate however you feel most comfortable.The keyboard is full-sized, but you do sacrifice a bit with the compactness of the computer, which may be a concern for those who do a lot of word processing or general typing. The chiclet keys, for example, are a different feel; the F keys are not separated into groupings of four as on a typical keyboard; and the like. Because of that, it's not as intuitive for people like me who don't look down when typing.Windows 8.1 is definitely not a strong selling point! But it appears Microsoft will hopefully be offering a limited time free upgrade to Windows 10. In the meantime, I installed Classic Shell to give it more of the feel of classic Windows.Edit: I originally gave the computer four stars, because its battery-charge status button and battery-charge status lights (all on the left side) weren't working. This made the computer's current battery charge level guesswork. The front status light worked, but that's basically an ""all or nothing"" light with only an indication of the battery being fully charged (off), charging (constant blue), or needing a charge (flashing orange). Thankfully, the computer also displays its current charge on the desktop, but it's inconvenient not being able to see the status without turning the computer on. That being said, the indicator light eventually started working several days after I got the computer. I turned the computer on, then held the button down for several seconds while the computer remained on. A little load symbol appeared on the desktop, after which point the LEDs lit up. There's currently no user manual, so I just wanted to mention how I got this feature to work in case others experience the same issue. It still doesn't work reliably, but is enough to (if I could) bump up the rating to 4 1/2 stars.The only slight complaint I have is that the battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped, since I tend to be on a computer for hours at a time. However, it's easy enough to plug it in. This laptop is really convenient for daily use, quick, and packs a lot of punch in a small package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPOGTU81FYZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJMTKO#wasThisHelpful","RIPOGTU81FYZ3","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon has these products grouped together, so I should preface the review by saying I have the larger, striped, rectangular basket. I would think the smaller ones would hold their shape better.I really like the appearance of this basket, and the color scheme. It pretty much fits in with any decor. This basket is large enough to hold magazines, which is what I'm using it for.Unfortunately, it's very floppy, and at this size it should probably be of thicker and stiffer ""yarn."" To give an idea of how soft/non-stiff the basket is, it ships flat. I think this issue will be different depending on the basket size you get, with larger ones being more prone to not be able to support their own weight. It's definitely not a bin you can pick up and move with ease, but more one that has to sit where you place it.As someone who crochets and knits, I'd also like to point out that these bins are made via crochet, not knit, stitches. There are telltale looks to each. While most people may not mind, you definitely don't get the look of knitted stitches with these bins.While the bin is attractive, it does have its limitations in being a bin that more has to stay put, due to its not being strong enough to carry things. That being said, it does look nice and is useful for stationary magazine storage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHUXR8IO6XXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWGAQ6M#wasThisHelpful","R1DHUXR8IO6XXN","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked this product for the short time that it worked. It helped add functionality to my Windows tablet so that I could hook up an external hard drive, flash/thumb drive, mouse, and keyboard. That being said, I dropped it and my tablet one time (from about waist height onto a plushly carpeted floor), and while my tablet fared fine, the metal part of this hub (the micro USB) end broke off, rendering the whole thing useless. Even though I was able to reattach the pins, it wouldn't register them again and wouldn't work.It also is unable to power things consistently, although this will depend on the device you're using and how much power it's able to send out to other things. For example, while you're typing on an external keyboard, you may suddenly find that the letters you're typing aren't showing up, and then later the keyboard will kick in again.It's nice to try something like this, and I did appreciate having it while it worked, so I'm giving it two stars. But it's not the best quality made item. It lasted a little over four months for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI653VJFOBDI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRBKDMC#wasThisHelpful","RI653VJFOBDI9","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is a bit of a cross between a puzzle and paper dolls, in that the clothing has obvious matches for educational value, but the pieces can still be mixed and matched for creative fun.Here's what comes in the set: 1 blue and gold macaw (parrot), 8 hats, 1 Jolly Roger (pirate flag), 1 monkey, 6 pants, 2 (smiling!) pirates, 8 shoes, 1 shovel, 2 swords, 1 telescope, 8 tops, 1 treasure chest, 2 treasure maps (rolled and unrolled). The main pieces have magnets near the front, while the accessory pieces have magnets on the back.Since the set is advertised as being ""wooden,"" it's important to point out that it's not wood. It's either fiberboard or MDF, leaning more toward a thick cardboard consistency and color. While this isn't important to everyone, there are a lot of people who would want to know this upfront. The wood grain you can see in photos is actually printed on a piece of paper. This is why I've removed one star.The set is best for horizontal play since the pieces can jostle off a bit, but they can withstand a little bit of upright/vertical play. Unfortunately, the backdrop has writing all over it, so it isn't really that useful for play purposes. That being said, this is still a really cute set, and it's nice to see paper dolls re-imagined in such a way that they can be targeted to little boys, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PWVJ2P2WS9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWD2U#wasThisHelpful","R27PWVJ2P2WS9E","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a beginning that seems somewhat akin to A Little Princess, Amelia is at school when she learns that her father is missing and presumed dead. Sent to live with her paternal uncle and his wife, she's disappointed to find that her aunt is of the belief that women should be perfect little homebodies. Her aunt finds pleasure in shopping and other stereotypical women's pursuits, all while dealing with a nervous affliction, perhaps stemming from a horrible loss.Amelia is forced to flee this home situation when her friend, her aunt and uncle's maid Effie, injures Amelia's uncle when coming to Amelia's defense. From there, Effie takes her to the poorer side of London, where Amelia sees firsthand how people from Effie's class live. But her biggest concern is a trunk she was supposed to inherit. It has been stolen by her uncle, who hopes to sell all its contents off. Can she get it back in time?I really enjoyed the book, and found it to be filled with rich visual details, perhaps due to the author's background as a screenwriter and director. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the editing was lacking at times, including the text being in past tense, but sometimes slipping into present, paragraph breaks missing, and the like. This is something that I'm sure they could improve in future printings, and it's still worth the read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B00ZZPGQV0YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0956720021#wasThisHelpful","R2B00ZZPGQV0YJ","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This birdseed smelled so good when I opened it and dumped it out into a couple of bird feeders that I almost wished I could eat it! It largely attracted chickadees, as one might expect, but also titmice, juncos, finches, cardinals, and a squirrel.I normally just feed birds black oil sunflower seeds, since those tend to be a universal favorite, but it was nice to offer a little bit of variety with this mix.

"Grace wants to start a business with her local friends over the summer, but her mom surprises her by saying they're going to Paris, because Grace's aunt--who lives in Paris with her husband and stepdaughter--is having a difficult pregnancy.When they arrive, Grace starts to learn about the patisserie her aunt and uncle run. Aside from this, there are various subplots, such as Grace getting to know a stray dog she names Bonbon, and trying to get to know her cousin Sylvie, who can't speak much English. While she's in Paris, Grace is sad to find out that her friends ended up starting a business without her. As the book progresses, readers are also taught some history about Paris.The book is written well, but I kept feeling like something was missing from the story. While I normally enjoy American Girl books, and have been a reader of them since childhood, this one didn't hold my attention too well, and I found it took me quite a long time to read it. It seemed that, though there were many plots, none were delved into deeply enough for me to learn to care for the characters. I wish the author had focused more on one of the subplots, which would have helped with getting to know and feel for the characters. It seems instead that details of various things such as Parisian foods and locales were described, giving more a picture of the location than a three-dimensional view of the characters. It also seemed there wasn't enough conflict with Grace. For example, when her mom tells her in the beginning of the book that she can't have a dog, she just moves on to another topic; Grace gets upset with her friends, but talks herself out of it, and the like. Grace comes across as a sweetheart, but it would have been more interesting if there had been more conflict in the book, as a bit of added tension would have helped drive the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBB0UOREHTVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609588916#wasThisHelpful","R2SBB0UOREHTVJ","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The illustrations in this set are absolutely adorable and look fit for a storybook. The clothing in the set includes: a dress, boots, hats, long and short pants, raincoat, shirts, shoes, shorts, and skirts. The other back-magnetized accessory pieces are a hay bale and shovel. There are so many accessories, the front pocket isn't really big enough to hold them all. The barn backing piece is more of a promotional piece and includes writing, so it's not really a part of the set.The accessory pieces have magnet sheets on the back, whereas the main pieces (Fran, Frank, and their pig and cow) have magnet sheets under the front layer. The magnets aren't super strong, so the toys are better for playing with horizontally, though they can be held upright and withstand a little bit of moving about.One thing that's nice is that the pieces are a bit of a puzzle, so this is not just a ""paper doll"" set. As I got this for a little boy to play with, this is a nice added aspect. The outfits can only be put on Fran and Frank in certain combinations. If boots are used, then they must be paired with shorter pants, and some pieces create very specific outfits for kids to figure out.I'm a ""wood snob"" in that I think things shouldn't be called ""wood"" or ""wooden"" unless they consist of wood or, at the very least, plywood--in other words, that they should have a real wood grain. So it's worth pointing out that the toy is made of fiberboard or pressboard and paper. Because of this, it's not very sturdy on the edges, and some of the pieces came with cracks and splits in the edges. The cow came with one horn's top layers detached and bent.Though the tote is nice, I wouldn't trust it to hold the pieces securely unless held upright, as some fell out during shipping. The pockets close with snaps, so there are plenty of gaps for pieces to fall through.That being said, the toy is still very fun, and the puzzle aspect of it adds educational value on top of the cuteness factor with the illustrations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKV8HGFRD3DL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWDRU#wasThisHelpful","RKV8HGFRD3DL8","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had wanted nail dotting tools for a long time and kept looking around on Amazon for them. This is a nice set in that you really do get five different dotting tool sizes (not just one dotting tool!), plus one end on each one has the same size dotting nub.You can do all sorts of different designs on your nails with dotters, not necessarily limited to dots. For example, swirls, squiggly lines, pictures, etc. These are really easy to use, and the metal cleans up easily.Although I would give them five stars ideally, the white one in my set had a loose nub (it came right out). When I glued it back in, the acrylic housing got cracks in it, though it's so far holding together.

"I'm so glad I got this stand! Prior to having it, I'd try to prop my 7"" tablet up on various things like books or pillows when trying to watch videos on YouTube. Not exactly an easy feat! I also tried to use a case not meant for it as a way to prop it up, but that usually ended in the tablet falling.While waiting for another tablet, I considered getting a case/stand specifically made for it, but it seemed a much better idea to get one that could be swapped between the two. This one is really nice in that it folds relatively flat, and it's really small, so it hardly takes up any room when not in use.The tablets I use it with are 7"" and 8"" (in screen size). They do wobble a bit when using the touch screen, so I'm not sure I'd go much larger in dimensions than 8"".

"Because Pinypon are often listed as you-get-what-you-get items, I'll specify first off that I'm reviewing the blonde fairy with a grey pearlescent unicorn. My description applies to one fairy you might possibly get.The blonde doll comes with super-glittered blonde hair. The shown face has pink and green eyeshadow with pink eyes. The left cheek has a butterfly on it. On the other face, she has green and purple eyeshadow with eyes that are green. The wings are laminated paper-like fabric that's green and reflects purple in spots. The top is yellow and green, with a yellow butterfly on it and pink at the neck. One special touch is a painted-on necklace. The skirt is mesh fabric on ribbon, with little glitter details in the mesh. This is removable for more customization options. The shoes are green and really unique in how the ties/laces wrap up the leg (including meeting at an X in the back).The two special accessories are a butterfly--which is different from the standard butterfly accessory in sculpt and made from a pearlescent plastic--and a wand, which is also pearlescent.The unicorn has pearlescent grey coloring, which is really whimsical and a nice touch. It has a yellow butterfly near its left rear. Pinypon isn't very consistent with pets' neck widths, but it can swap heads with other animals that I believe are from newer sets.If your kids would prefer for their Pinypon dolls not to be whimsical, it's worth noting that the wings just slip between the neck and head and are removable (as one piece), so this Pinypon doesn't ""need"" to be a fairy.I had to give this set four stars because of some paint issues. Also, the glittering done on the hair is really messy, and on so thickly in some spots that it literally just chips right off. I soaked it in hot water to get some of the extra off, but it would have been nice if they had perhaps done a translucent hair with the glitter embedded in the plastic instead, or maybe if they had done pearlescent hair it would have still had a magical touch to it.

"This Pinypon doll comes with light purple hair that sweeps to her right, and five little accessories. One of the unique pieces in this set, as it's often more commonly seen with boy Pinypon dolls, is pants. The pants have a rhinestone on the right pocket. She has glittery purple shoes. The top is a strapless white top with a pink glittery heart on the left.Her showing face has a star on the right cheek, purple eyebrows, and a winking eye. Her eyeshadow has glitter on it. The surprise face is open eyes (pink) with eyelashes and a half smile. This is a really unique face for Pinypon.She's really cute, although I have to admit that the top style is my least favorite with Pinypon. However, it's easy to customize them if need be, and she has other very unique pieces that are worth adding to your kids' Pinypon collection.The painting on mine was relatively good, so I'm giving it five stars.

"This set (referring to the one with a girl with light purple hair and cat) comes with five accessories. There are some significant repeats with this set as compared to one of the Pinypon Collectors Sets (that comes with four dolls and two pets, from Series 1).It also comes with the cat (although with some painting differences, such as under the chin, a different colored collar, different colored bow, and a heart painted on the left cheek).The main repeat between sets is the face, which is the face with glasses on one side and a small open-mouthed grin on the other, both sides with purple eyes.The clothing on this Pinypon is very cute, with a t-shirt that has a little rhinestone on it. Beneath the skirt there is a special touch of shorts, so the doll doesn't need to wear the skirt piece and has more wardrobe options.This is a cute little set or add on, but it's worth noting that it might have some major repeat parts as compared to another set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQR4HN98XSLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8VOO60#wasThisHelpful","R1KQR4HN98XSLW","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this set (the one with a blonde haired girl and brunette boy--which is showing as orange in the photo) largely for the boy in it, to give to a little boy. It's hard to find boy Pinypon characters, and when you do they're generally blonde. The face required some custom tweaking since the boy is very much a love face, which I can't imagine a boy liking. On one side of his face he's winking and has a heart in his open eye. On the other side of his face, he has a large heart in each eye, and a lipstick kiss mark on his left cheek.The female has a kiss face with heart mark on her left cheek on one side, and on the other side, three hearts in each eye. This side is really unique, as she has an open-mouthed smile with upper teeth showing. Her cloth dress is removable, and there is a red strapless top beneath.I'm not sure what I think of a romance theme for Pinypon, as I like to think of them as young children. But adults should be aware they can make some changes to the faces, if wanted, with nail polish remover, craft paint, and sealer. It doesn't yield perfect results (be careful as the nail polish remover may mar the plastic), but is an option if changes are desired.A real selling point to this set might be the special accessory pieces. Those are a box of chocolates, flowers (a single one and bouquet), hair bow, handbag in an unique style, two perfume bottles, and a wrapped gift.I knocked a star off because I had to remove some stray paint marks on one side of the girl's face. I wish Pinypon would have better quality control as it's often necessary to clean up the toys with water or nail polish remover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKWSQ8L1MTNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CA7JHI#wasThisHelpful","RBKWSQ8L1MTNJ","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:20 Mins This is a cute, basic train with three cars (engine, car that can tote things, and caboose). It's really sweet that they included an old-fashioned caboose. I remember as a kid, the worker in the back would often smile and wave to people waiting in cars, and this is such a missed part of trains nowadays.The two bears have the same sculpt/mold, and while this is being picky, it would have been a nice touch to have them each different, and it would have also been an added touch if they could stand outside the caboose between it and the railings.The wheels move very smoothly, especially on a hard surface. You have to be a bit careful in handling the caboose as the top/roof comes off very easily, so it can't really be picked up that way.This is our third Green Toys toy, and I just have to comment on how cool the texture of the plastic is.

If you've never seen them before, each one is about 1"" high.A neat extra touch to them is that a lot of them (10 out of 12 in the set I purchased) have a hole in the base so that they can be used as pencil toppers.The attached video shows the ones that I got in the set. Though this will vary, I hope it will just give you a representational view of what comes in a set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H8E1M10X4EJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5ZALA0#wasThisHelpful","R2H8E1M10X4EJ7","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tablet is almost like having a mini computer. To show you how much so, I composed and posted this review using it! It's like having a miniature computer in the things that it's capable of doing.I did a lot of research while waiting for it to arrive, as I wanted the ability to use a full-sized keyboard, mouse, camera, flash drive, and printer with standard USB connections. The tablet itself just has one micro USB port. It can take Bluetooth products, but a way around this, and a way to spend less money, is to get a micro USB hub that has a micro USB and splits into female standard USB ports. Of course it will depend on the adapter and things you're plugging in, but I can run about one thing via the converter USB. Two seems to overtax the amount of power the tablet gives out, even if I have the extra part plugged into a power source. It also drops the mouse a lot, though that could be my mouse. Anyway, I wanted to mention this since it adds a lot of functionality to be able to plug in a mouse, keyboard, printer, camera, thumb drive, and other things that use a standard USB. There doesn't seem to be an adapter that will allow you to charge or power the tablet while using a hub, unfortunately. Installing a printer (or anything else not plug and play) can be a bit confusing, as you may need to check to see if your printer's manufacturer has free drivers to download on their website, as you can't install them via a CD-Rom.The tablet only comes with a trial of Microsoft Office, so I decided not to take the trial. The fact that it doesn't include a ""permanent"" word processing package is why I docked a star. That being said, Notepad is included, so you can at least do some minor word processing--like writing Amazon reviews!--if you decide not to accept the free trial offer. Aside from that, with the new Windows 8 you can install apps--there are plenty of free ones--surf the Internet, and use various Windows compatible downloads (like Firefox). It's nice in Desktop mode since you can use the full-fledged versions of downloaded software like Chrome or Firefox, instead of the lesser ones you have to use with an Android tablet.Aside from that, there's not much to say as it's pretty much like a miniature PC. Generally, a common statement is that computers are for content creation and tablets are for content consumption. However, I would say this is a bit in between in that you can tweak it a bit to make it more versatile. I do wish it came with a standard USB connection, but this workaround is okay for running a keyboard, and you can also use Bluetooth, as well. I would most recommend this tablet for people who don't like the limited capabilities of an Android tablet. I have both, and have to say it's frustrating at times in that I get sent to tablet versions of websites and can't do certain things like watching videos (depending on the file type used) on Android. This is like a miniature PC in the software it's compatible with, and it allows for some productivity, not just entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QFUQY2H0CDUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK8S1IU#wasThisHelpful","R3QFUQY2H0CDUZ","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I've read a Beforever book where I hadn't read the historical characters' books beforehand. Before I get into reviewing it, that kind of brings up a good point. Based off my reading experiences with the three I've read so far, I would think it best if girls read the historical series first. Otherwise, there are various spoilers in the books, telling about things that happen to the girls. As an example, right off the bat Caroline tells the main character that the British were firing at people and she helped with the situation. I'm assuming that was part of one of the stories in her six (now two) books.Anyway, on to the story! The setup is that the unnamed main character's mom has joined the navy and will soon be leaving the family for eight months. This is something the main character is understandably really sad about. Her mom gives her a family heirloom compass, and this magically transports her back to Caroline's time, during the War of 1812. This is the first Beforever book I've noticed that has a really quick ending if the reader decides not to travel to the past, after seeing how she can return. But where's the fun in that? Not choosing that quick ending, the reader can do such things as help Caroline's grandmother bake, ride on a navy ship as it chases a British ship, help a wounded sailor, or even just have a nice heart-to-heart with Caroline. Caroline offers life lessons to the main character, as her father has been captured by the British and is away, just as the main character's mother will be gone with the navy.The book was fun to read, and offered a good variety of adventures, from a ship adventure to visiting a hospital, to just home chores like sewing (not very well!) and helping Caroline's grandmother with baking.I'll be reviewing Kaya's book in this series next. While I was skeptical of this series as someone who grew up with the pre-Mattel American Girl, and these seem to change the series into more of a Magic Attic, more fanciful world where time travel exists, I do think they might help reluctant readers feel a part of history and more interested in the historical characters, and they're definitely fun to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSKGQOX4SKZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609584473#wasThisHelpful","R3JSKGQOX4SKZ2","A2I4A4WGWII18Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I4A4WGWII18Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've read all the stories in this box set and I've enjoyed them all. Daisy McDare is a talented interior decorator but she's even better at solving mysteries. Who would believe she's always involved in murder? Daisy is an interesting character. She is tenacious in her pursuit of the murderer and in feeding her sweet tooth. I loved her. She is a charming and humorous. Her sassy dialogue made me laugh and the secondary characters were perfect foils for Daisy. I loved the touch of romance that Gavin added. These stories are fast paced and well plotted. The identity of the culprit is always a surprise. K.M. Morgan keeps me guessing until the very end. This cozy mystery collection hit the spot.

Can she work with him knowing that he doesn't see her as a desirable woman? Izzy is smart, funny and attractive. She's the real deal. I liked her immediately and wanted her to get her man.

I loved the characters and the setting. It was interesting that this women only resort was home to wolves searching for their forever mate. The Alpha's Woman by A.C. Arthur evoked different emotions. Kira Radney is a kick-ass woman who won't be subjugated. She's an Alpha in her own right. Forced to flee to save herself. She's caught by an alpha wolf who wants to protect her. As these two battle they fight a strong desire for each other. Where will their story end? The characters are dangerous and compelling. The setting is dark and brooding. Kira was a powerful character. I liked her strength and courage. When she an Blaez are together the sparks and the passion are amazing. Claimed by the Mate was a very satisfying and sexy. Be aware that the heat factor is hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0VDDO8JQUJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDWNK1E#wasThisHelpful","R2P0VDDO8JQUJK","A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The characters are captivating and the story is skillfully crafted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0H1UZ5MEMZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111ONVW2#wasThisHelpful","R3E0H1UZ5MEMZ0","A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Valerie Dimitri knows what she wants and that's love and commitment. She won't marry to be a pawn to a man's ambitions. Which is why she is on the run. Her intended wanted ties to her family's criminal enterprise. She has been in hiding for a year and has a new identity as well as a successful business. Sex Talk With Serena is very popular. Boone Sullivan has a bone to pick with her. Her advice resulted in a very public breakup with his bride right before their wedding. Now that the sexy ballplayer has found her, sparks fly and her world turns upside down. What a romance! I love this story. Boone is floored when he falls for Serena. He wants her as his lover, but he feels that his career is more important. These characters are so charming that I was drawn into their story from the first page. Their chemistry is off the charts. I'm a great baseball fan so I enjoyed the baseball background. The dialogue is entertaining and the couple's battle of wills is both amusing and passionate. Catherine Mann and Joanne Rock did a wonderful job with this quick and entertaining read. This is a great addition to the Runaway Brides series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6RVPFFQZM1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI9G9A4#wasThisHelpful","R2R6RVPFFQZM1N","A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samantha Dekker is a Hollywood screenwriter. After her husband's suicide, she's been ostracized.  The paparazzi have stalked her and lurid tabloid stories were regular occurrences. Now she has a second chance to work at her craft. The only problem is mega-star Gage Cutler. He's the man she met years ago and was attracted to. Can she work with him after she publicly blamed him for the accident that injured her husband? Sam is a wounded creature. She lived through hell and even now she's being stalked by an unknown person who wants vengeance. Gage suffered just as much as Sam but he's trying to move forward. He's in love with her and wants them to have a life together. I was frustrated by Sam's reluctance to change. I wanted her to realize that life is too short and make a future. The secondary characters were interesting and good at causing angst. Ethan's family was way out there in their hate. Malibu Betrayals was filled with suspense combined with a passionate romance. It was cleverly plotted and kept me reading. The behind the scenes look at Hollywood had a ring of truth. I enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NPD48V2TRPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111KOWQ0#wasThisHelpful","R6NPD48V2TRPI","A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J4ZZVGTNBQFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alexis Wyndham is a crusader. She learned a bitter lesson when she was betrayed by her best friend. She was humiliated and lost her ability to trust. Now she keeps people in line by fear and intimidation, but a high school project may just be her undoing. She's working with the most popular guy in school, Brett Pederson. He's a jock and captain of the football team. He's the type of person that she detests on principle. Can we say disaster? Alexis has a good heart. She just wants to protect herself from more pain. Suddenly she's out of her depth. The more she gets to know Brett the more she likes him and is attracted to him. There is a kindness and gentleness in him that surprises her. Maybe you can't judge people by their labels. Crista McHugh has written a charming, humorous story that has a lot of heart. Her characters are interesting and the dialogue is snappy and snarky. I loved it! The high school setting brings back memories and is the perfect backdrop for Confessions of a Queen B* This story was great fun. I loved the romance. Alexis and Brett were great together. There are no surprises here, but plenty of fun.

"If you like space operas, ideas SF, strong world-building, and good writing, you'll like Superluminal.I enjoy all of those and have really enjoyed Superluminal and the first book in the (abbreviated) series, Metaplanetary. Daniel has imagined a pretty interesting future for the solar system with a fully realized concept of virtual worlds, interesting AI, and cool concepts for engineering, military, and generally what it means to be human in many new ways that technology makes possible.There are two downsides to the series: number one, as others noted, that it is sadly unfinished. ""Ames"" took over the publisher, I suppose. And second, the fundamental plot motivation is a bit hard to swallow: that a genocidal dictator is somehow swaying the whole inner solar system. The latter doesn't bother me too much. In fact there have been inexplicable genocidal dictators in history, which just proves that reality is stranger than fiction (although it doesn't excuse inexplicable fiction). But more to the point, the books are satisfying for many other reasons and I'm able to shrug at the but even more you can just keep reading despite a bit of incredulity.It's worth a read despite the unfinished nature; the book delivers plenty for SF idea and space story readers, and is one of the most interesting, best-imagined examples of world-building that I've read in several years. I wish Daniel would be able to finish it!Do you need to read Book 1 (Metaplanetary) first? Technically, no, this book explains everything. But you will enjoy the series much more if you start with Book 1, I think: the characters will be richer and in particular you will have a much better understanding of the AI converts and how the virtual world works.Update: on first review, I gave it 4 stars primarily for the clunkiness of the plot and the fact the series is unfinished. After thinking more about it, I decided that was too harsh: the publication problems are out of the author's control, and the book itself is clearly top 20% in SF despite the slight silliness. And I keep wishing there were more! So I'm now saying 4.5 and rounding up to 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSEJZJ9AKLNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCK4JA#wasThisHelpful","R2YSEJZJ9AKLNQ","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel starts with a great idea: what if Asimov's psychohistory (here called cliology) were taken seriously today? I won't go into the plot, except to say that it leads to the idea of a secret society and dangers for the protagonists. The good part of the book is the idea and how that plays out, and the kinds of ethical issues that arise. Flynn handles those parts well.Unfortunately, it lets us down on two other fronts. One is purely modern: the book already seems dated in far too many ways. It's only been 13 years since it was published but the plot lines involve computer details in ways that seem absurd today. I don't expect older SF to get everything right, of course, but neither do I expect to wade through pages of plots that depend on point-in-time details about online searching, that fall apart in the presence of cell phones, and so forth.The second problem is the sheer complexity of the plot line as it nears the finish line. It seems to me that Flynn wrote his way out of a plot mess simply by adding players.Finally, the plot itself involves secret societies in ways that were perhaps somewhat unique in the 1990s, but today seem like just a stale rehash of Alias, Lost, 24 and other such conspiracy shows. Overall, the dragging technology, absurd plot, and stale conspiracies make it a slog for today's reader.I give 4 stars for the concept, take away 2 for the old tech and plot silliness, and finally add 1 back thanks to the thought-provoking scientific appendix (yes, science -- of a sort -- in a SF novel!)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDCSJY958KX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MYFULE#wasThisHelpful","RGDCSJY958KX7","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to use with a mini LED projector to connect a Macbook Air to HDMI. It works just fine for that; picture quality on the projector is good, and it's nice to have the adapter separate from the cable. If either one stops working, I could still use the other.The reason to dock 1 star is that the cable is so heavy. It's very sturdy, more so that I really wanted for portable business usage. It takes up quite a bit of room in my case or on conference room tables. Of course for other uses, the sturdiness may be advantageous; I just wish I had known that it was so heavy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11C7I87FPGCBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VYQLA0#wasThisHelpful","R11C7I87FPGCBF","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to use for brief meetings in typical conference rooms. It works OK for that if the room is slightly darkened (e.g., shades pulled or bright lights turned off). In many conference rooms, you can just turn off half of the lights and this will work fine.To use it, you will need to supply some kind of cable to connect your computer. In my case, I wanted to connect a MacBook Air, and thus used a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable.Getting the Mac to recognize it was slightly tricky the first time; had to select the projector for external HD input, and then go to Mac system properties ""displays"", mirror the displays, and reduce resolution to 720p. For some reason it did not show a constant display but blinked on and off. However, after disconnecting it and trying again, it worked fine and continues to do so every time so far (about half a dozen times at this point). There is no longer any need to mess with the Mac settings, but the projector requires selecting the external input. It would be nicer if it recognized the input automatically.Another wish is that it had a remote control. Using the buttons on top is adequate but a remote would be better.The picture quality seems perfectly good enough for business presentations. Just focus the slides using the controller and presentations will look good. The keystone feature is nice for business slides, as it automatically makes the picture ""square"" even when projecting upward from an angle on a table.Overall, I'm very happy with it and would buy again for portable business usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKPYU3YKER51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MC27OI#wasThisHelpful","RWKPYU3YKER51","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This show makes you think, ""Wow that must be exactly how things work in Washington."" Not literally of course, but in the kind of distilled essence and feeling that fiction can communicate.The high point is Kevin Spacey's acting; it's a one man tour de force. Some of the sexual intrigue is clearly overdone ... but again, should be taken more as an exaggeration or metaphor that reveals the core of relationships.Will you like it?

"I got this because I was tired of plugging my phone into my stereo to listen to music. With this HomeSpot device, I can now stream with Bluetooth from across the living/dining room and control the music and volume easily.Setting it up was simple: plug it in and connect the mini-mic cable to stereo (comes with both mini-mic and RCA plugs). I searched for BT devices on my phone and it paired the first time (and every other time so far).The range is good; it's working at about 25 feet distance with modest obstacles in the way (a chair and a partial corner in between the phone and receiver). The connection breaks up when I add more obstacles (a complete wall full of appliances), which is to be expected.The only downsides are that it requires yet another fat mini-USB adapter to plug in somewhere, and the device is so light and tiny that the cables pull it and make it difficult to lie flat.

"My favorite SF books are idea-driven space opera -- Alaistair Reynolds, James Corey -- and the like, and this is one of best. If you like literate, idea-packed SF, this is well worth your time.The ideas are superb and present concepts that still hold up well a decade after first publication. Indeed, there is very little in the book that seems dated at all; it could just as well be a current SF novel. Many of the ideas about AI and how humans might be in the future are surprisingly unique and well explicated. The style throws you right into the world with a minimum of explanation (which is a good thing).The one issue with it is this: the world it lays out is sufficiently complex, and some of the characters are so unique, that it takes a while for the plot to get going. I almost abandoned the book about 100 pages in, because I thought it was too slow and I didn't relate to the characters. However, I kept going because of the interesting ideas. And then at about 150 pages, it started to take off -- by page 200, it was really rolling. So, if you do start it, plan to keep reading for 150 pages to evaluate well.I'm looking forward to the sequel, Superluminal!Update: I just finished reading Superluminal, and it was great, too. My only regret is that the series was not finished apparently due to the publisher. Yet the ideas and world-building are great, and it's well worth reading. I hope someday the third volume will be published.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15444JNY1Y08E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC12TG#wasThisHelpful","R15444JNY1Y08E","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the clear case for a Moto X phone. The case is OK -- it fits tight although the clear case (as warned) hides basically all of the phone's color.The case is a tough, fairly thick plastic and seems that it would work well to protect from a fall onto concrete, etc. Also note that it covers the buttons on the sides -- which I like, as that adds more protection and keeps dirt out of them. They work OK even though they are covered.The one minor thing I don't like about the case is that it seems just a little bulky. The product info says  ""ultra thin"" but it definitely has a bit of bulk around the edges; I guess I thought it would be thinner. But it's OK and if anything is better protection so that is a minor issue. I like that it is non-slippery but not as grippy as a silicone type. It's just about right to be easy to hold.When the case first arrived, it was for the wrong phone -- but I sent a note to the seller, and received an email reply within 20 minutes. They sent a new case that arrived in 2 days and refunded the purchase. That's great service. Mistakes happen but this makes me feel very good about recommending Diztronic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DREUA1QX8XGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E24YUAG#wasThisHelpful","R3DREUA1QX8XGF","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're working on journal articles or a monograph using LaTeX, this is a great book. In particular, it serves two audiences quite well: newcomers to LaTeX who want a thorough and readable conceptual introduction, and more experienced LaTeX users who are ready to move beyond the basics.For my part, I had used LaTeX for a couple of years to do things like Beamer presentations when I needed technical slides. Then I started work on a monograph that needed a much more complete set of LaTeX features: table of contents, index, chapters, bibliography, and so forth.The core of this book is coverage of articles and books, so it's great for those. It does NOT pretend to be a systematic reference; there are a number of tables of symbols and the like, and an excellent index, but it's designed more to teach than to be purely a reference volume.Sure, you can find ""the answer"" to most LaTeX questions online -- but only if you know what to ask, and with no systematic presentation. This book helped give me a much more systematic perspective and saved me tremendous time with its tips and directions of where to look. It is also surprisingly readable, as much as a technical book can be. I find it enjoyable to flip through or take to the doctor's office and browse topics, and I always learn something.Finally, for anyone working on a book, this volume stands out for its very helpful (although brief) coverage of issues related to longer documents such as monographs: include, includeonly, indexing, and so forth. In addition to the core LaTeX functionality, it also briefly examines the Springer monograph class (which makes sense because it's a Springer book).Overall it's the most helpful of the few LaTeX books I have. Thanks to the author for the care to produce it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGTUJH9H08U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0387322892#wasThisHelpful","RTGTUJH9H08U5","A3I5TRZZSO8C0B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I5TRZZSO8C0B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Other couple was impressed enough that they will no doubt buy one for themselves.Very fast pairing with multiple devices and not one drop out so far...I found that I like the sound better when the unit is standing on end rather than on the rubber foot as pictured, but depending on where you place it..  one side is the powered speaker and the other side is the passive non powered port, so one side is louder than the other.  Just bounce the sound off of other hard surfaces to get what you want.Nice large rubber covered control buttons on one end, and all plug in ports with tight seal rubber cap on the other.I DO wish the rubber cap over the ports had rubber as hinge or lanyard so the cap could not be lost.  Seals well, but a little too easy to remove I believe. No doubt the rubber cap is not replaceable item.This device has been rated IPX-5IPX-5 test rating means it is protected against low pressure water stream from any angle.Under the cap is an LED set to show state of charge, Micro USB in port for charging, full size USB out for charging another device, plus 3.5mm phono plug sockets for sound IN and OUT for non Bluetooth use if needed.Note that the power supply for the LUX is 1400mah which is great for speaker use, but if used to charge your MP3 player or smartphone it would be slow going if device normally needs 2.1A charger rate.Still, a useful thing if you need some power in your phone even at slower charge speed.LUX itself charged up quickly using a 2.1A ac adapter12.3 oz on the digital scale and can fit in most coat or jacket pockets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G1QFI0DAMO4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7A97JU#wasThisHelpful","R3G1QFI0DAMO4I","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the way 5 mil thickness works, comes out more like a plastic shell than just a soft cover.  Not always needed, but price is not that much more than thinner versions and results are very pleasing.I do know that 3 mil pouches have their place and can work well for most single or double sided pages, and do use both when called for.No way to test the ""Image Last"" UV protection with the passage of time, but don't think a well known company would claim it works if it does not.  You can count on me returning to say if it fails over time.And if you can't think of anything to laminate, Fellows offer free downloads from their ""Idea Center"" to print.... clever move.Just as a point of interest, I think this is the first product I've ever had that is made in Vietnam.So far, no problems using these but nothing different in the process than any other large pouch, just make sure your laminator is up to the job of heating and rolling 5 mil plastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAHJ5JH5IWPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAS9EW#wasThisHelpful","R3AAHJ5JH5IWPS","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice set of ""Impact"" rated driver bits with wood drill bits with countersink collars in a fairly nice case with metal hinge pin and slide latch.Unlike the typical lower cost softer metal bits you see everywhere at low cost, these are made of high grade steel using the cold forged method in order to make the square and phillips bits last several times longer than the lower priced bits.Note that even though all the driver bits are stronger than most you see for sale, Irwin does not make the 3x longer life statement for the Torx, slotted or Hex head bits and HD long life feature does not apply to the drill bits themselves according to the product details listed.If you are not going to be using them with an impact tool, they should last even longer I'd say.The driver bits also have the notch to allow them to lock into devices that support lock in feature..  Power screwdrivers, full size drill/drivers, some with 1/4"" hex impact feature or attachements.If you have a need for these, then you no doubt know how to use them so won't go into the basics of woodworking here etc.Good quality set in decent storage case at a fair price","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39USWTJ7R4T81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLGRKWI#wasThisHelpful","R39USWTJ7R4T81","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, it's part plastic, yes at 9.5 ounces it feels like less of a staple driver than the larger, heavier,solid metal, chrome plated brand out there...BUT...I found out within the first full row of staples loaded and driven that I could tell it was going to be better all around than that all metal beast I've had for so many years now.  You know the one......I fired staples into every type of wood I had on hand from soft pine to hard oak, new wood and some very old wood... tested with a full strip of 5/16"" staples and the only (three) staples that did not go flush or below the surface were the shots that I did not hold the Tacwise firm enough or flat enough to the surface and had a bit of bounce back, and even then they were not very far from flush and only needed a light tap to seat fully.However your results will depend on the material(s) you are working with and the size and material the staples are made of.  Some cheap staples will never work well no matter what staple gun you use.First thing to try if you don't get a flush staple is to place your other hand over the top of the gun to help keep the kickback down.  Most times, this will cure the problem of not keeping device hard against work piece.Uses 140 series staples from 6-8mm (5/32 thru 5/16"") Be sure to buy a good brand made of the proper metal and length needed for your projectLever/trigger pull is much lighter and less of a reach than the old stand by brand also, and the big thing noticed is that with the textured plastic it did not want to slip and slide in my hand like the big chrome plated jobs do.Lever lock works well as long as you use both lock buttons at the same time, one on each side.  Then a simple slide will lock and unlock the handle.THEN, to top things off, a METAL belt hook that keeps the gun handy while you use both of your hands on your work piece.You'll also find they added a little clear plastic removable window that keeps a paper with the owners name easy to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8MEJD3OGANJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00815IZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R2I8MEJD3OGANJ","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four Amazon stars for ""I like it""Plastic containers rather than glass.  Good, bad ?  Time will tell, but wish they were glass based on the fact that this will pulverize whatever you put in it including nuts and ice.  Can't be good on the plastic.Only other concern about being plastic is the handle for the 32oz blender container.  Seems the plastic handle is only glued to the side of the plastic container.  Would feel better if it had straps all the way around or some sort of bolt on system.Of course I could be wrong and this will stay on for the life of the machine, we shall see.The seal on the 32oz blender is wide with three sealing ridges and looks to be a pretty good seal and takes a bit of effort to push on and pull off... but if you use (as example) the ""smoothie"" or ""frozen drink"" setting, be sure to keep one hand on the top as it will build pressure enough for liquid to get past the seal as it pushes the lid up a bit.We made sure we did not fill past the max fill line but this thing has lots of power and the contents come to the top with some force.Each catagory of blending has a button on the front panel with an LED light for each when in use...  When you select a function it goes into preprogrammed action.  For example, if you tell it you have ice cubes in the mix, it will pulse on high several times before it goes into the speed for frothing up the drink etc.  Pretty cool...The rubber feet on the base unit are actually suction cups to keep it from walking around the counter when in use..  great feature.A bit of noise involved, but then the more power the more noise as a general rule I think...Ours did not come with any kind of owners manual at all, but don't know if that was a packing mistake or if none come with instructions.Two blades, but easy to see which is the HD cutter and which is the mixing/blending blade.For some reason they used a cord with VERY stiff insulation covering on this machine... Feels more like plastic than rubber.2 year warrantyUPDATE 12/2014;The hard and stiff electrical cord is really annoying and not easy to deal with when you move the blender around the counter top.  Sticks up in the air and will not stay down like a soft cord would.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MV1M3CGP70F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNRJK9M#wasThisHelpful","R5MV1M3CGP70F","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not like tires that come out looking like they came in a plastic model kit and prefer the look of clean rubber tires, this did just that for me and I'm happy with it just for my tires.If you don't overspray, it doesn't take all that much product to do the job, I like to rub it in and around with a small cloth soaked with the same protectant.Works just fine on all the rubber seals around trunk, hood and doors also, should keep it supple and make it last longer in the Sun.Didn't irritate my skin at all and smells rather good, seemed to wash off my hands better than some of these type protectants.Never actually saw this brand before this, but will not hesitate to try their other products, since this one worked well.Not a huge deal, but don't care for the spray head much, although it produces a good spray, it is a bit wider/larger than most others and wasn't as easy to hold for me, but threads are standard on the bottle top so easy enough to swap out for another one from empty bottle around the garage.Still have to see how long it will last after application however,  will sure come back and tell you if it does not sty on very long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLKWL5XDAJW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V0G3B4#wasThisHelpful","R1WLKWL5XDAJW3","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No kidding, I thought my Wife's Jeep was as clean and shiny as it could be to start with... I couldn't believe it but these products took it past my previous results in making the vehicle look like new.  No hype, could not be happier with each and every product in this 3M care kit.This might be the toughest test for such products since the Jeep was looking good to start with, which should make it harder to impress with results compared to seeing it go from ugly, dirty and dull to finished etc.True, there are several steps and several bottles to use, but really could not be easier as each one does what it was made to do and you don't have to do the whole vehicle at the same time, just full areas to edges or corners.Although all items worked so well, I have to single out the Leather/Vinyl restorer as it did better on the exterior black plastic parts (mirrors, bumper pads, door handles, roof rack parts, rocker molding) than anything I've tried to date.  It's not promoted for that use, but I'm impressed andhave to say, I've been using one of the best known, most popular products for this many years now... will not mention the brand name but it's top of the line and advertised on all the weekend cars shows on TV.I do think it would be nice if you were able to get this kit with no microfiber cloths as many people will already have a good supply and it would cut the cost of ""kit"" quite a bit.  (not sure how they come up with the full MSRP ""list"" price on this after checking price on each item)This kit should really have a soft detail brush included to get around emblems/trim and into tight spots.Perhaps in place of one or two of the cloths if not in addition.If unsure, all products are available separately if you don't want all at once, you can build to the full ""kit"" as you are happy with how each works.I'm sold, I will now buy these 3M products instead of what I've been using for years... what more can I say.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC56277AQJN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KI8EE6#wasThisHelpful","R1QC56277AQJN7","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four star for ""I like it"" as it does do what it should and does improve the TV watching experience....although I'm not thrilled with the current selling price compared to similar units.  Perhaps the Denon will outlast all the others to make up for the higher initial cost.175 watts output divided between all speakers and it does boost volume and quality over what the stock TV speakers are capable of by a long shot.Playing music from my smartphone via Bluetooth to the sound bar produces some pretty nice sounds... Streaming Pandora also sounds good from the Smart TV / InternetAt first I found the maximum volume to be low, but I changed my hook up and used only the Toslink cable rather than what the quick start booklet called for (Toslink plus HDMI for non ARC connector)  Volume is now increased to a level where you don't need full blast.All hook up cables are included, unless you need longer than supplied to mount on wall or away from TV etc.Even an IR remote sensor extension in case your TVs get blocked by the sound bar in front of it.Included are;HDMI cable, optical digital audio cable, 3.5-millimeter-to-3.5-millimeter stereo analog audio cable, 3.5-millimeter-to-RCA adapterEasy to hook up with any sound connections you might have on your TV and to get started only requires you to select your preference for type of sound mode you want to use  and set the volume level.. Modes all toggle with same remote button so you need to watch the button lights on the bar to decode which it is set on.The Samsung smart TV we have it on does not have ARC (Audio Return Channel) on any of the HDMI ports so have it hooked up with Toslink digital optical cable which is the second best hook up in the quick start manual after HDMI.As default setting, the sound bar will turn on when you turn on the TV with the TV remote.  (can sense if the TV is on/off though cable connections)Turning the sound bar off while the TV is on will only see it turn itself back on again.  I do not want the sound bar on for all TV watching and only when I want it on so had to toggle the DHT-S514 to manual setting in order to get that control.Using the supplied IR remote control, it is difficult to know which ""mode"" you have it on as there is only the small LED button lights on the top front of sound bar to let you know your selection.From a normal viewing distance you can not tell what is what (perhaps you might memorize positions and icons at some point)When plugged in, the BlueTooth sub woofer (110-120V AC-no power pack) pairs itself quickly when sound bar is on,LED on the back of woofer case will stop flashing red and glowa green when ready.  Has it's own manual volume knob on the back also.Always ready for use, but wish it had an on/off switch so not using AC on standby all the time, I will give it it's own power strip with switchWorks well, sounds good...  always good if you need to turn it down a bit in my opinion.For more power and true surround sound you might want to have a look at another Denon home theater setup if you have the room for it.Denon DHT-1513BA Total 650 Watt 5.1 Channel Home Theater System with Boston Acoustics Premium Speaker SystemSpecs for DHT-S514 Soundbar;Rated output:Sound bar10 W + 10 W (4 Î©/ohms, 200 Hz, 0.7 % T.H.D)Subwoofer49 W (4 Î©/ohms, 60 Hz, 0.7% T.H.D)Frequency Range:40 Hz to 20 kHzHigh Frequency Drivers:35/64"" (14 mm) tweeter x 2Mid Frequency Drivers:2 1/64 x 5"" (51 x 127 mm) HHRT drivers x 2Low Frequency Drivers:5 15/64"" (133 mm) woofers x 2Dimensions: (H x W x D)Sound bar3 9/64 x 39 17/32 x 3 5/64"" (79.8 x 1004 x 78.3 mm)Subwoofer12 21/64 x 6 3/4 x 13 5/8"" (313 x 171.5 x 346 mm)Wireless Technologies:Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, A2DP, APT-X2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz triband frequency hopping (subwoofer)Rating Voltage:AC 120 V, 60 HzPower consumption:Sound barDC 24 V, 2.5 A0.5 W or less (Standby)Subwoofer60 WWeight:Sound bar5 lbs 1 oz (2.3 kg)Subwoofer13 lbs (5.9 kg)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFEN266GZ9QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXXSI9I#wasThisHelpful","R2EFEN266GZ9QW","A9Y5O2R4D6EH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9Y5O2R4D6EH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just like the heavy-duty OtterBox Defender, the Commuter is made with two levels of protection: bump negating synthetic rubber, and rigid polycarbonate armor.  Unlike the Defender, however, the Commuter puts the rigid armor on the OUTSIDE, so it's your outer layer of protection.Personally, I like the Communter's design a bit better.  With the slick polycarbonate on the outside, it slide in and out of pockets easily without picking up lint or being resistant.  While this does mean that the poly will get scratched if dropped (WHEN dropped in my case) it makes more sense to me to have the soft rubber up against the phone.Also, I like the fact that the screen protector is separate.  This means that it adheres directly to the screen and won't move around or cause image distortion.Of course, there are drawbacks.  Mainly, the in form of port access.  Kudos for keeping the charging and headset ports covered and protected, but with the hard poly on the outside, it's a bit tough peeling back the rubber and keeping it out of the way when trying to plug anything in.  And the Silence switch is no easier to deal with.Regardless, this is serious armor and will keep your phone safe from most drops.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SN0KK1FHN6BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7ST1WS#wasThisHelpful","R3SN0KK1FHN6BQ","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll cut right to the chase:Massive pain to set this up, but once it's going it's pretty good.The long version:This Q-See camera system with DVR comes with everything you need to get it up and running except a video monitor or computer to use as a monitor. (I've connected mine to a laptop.)The cameras all need to be physically connected to the DVR box.  They all receive their power and send their video feeds this way.  While the connecting cords are about 60 feet long, remember that you won't be running chords ""as the crow flies.""  If you want to tuck chords away or run them in corners of walls, that 60 feet runs out quickly.  (One 15x15x9 foot room could eat up as much as 40 feet of cable depending upon how the cable is run and DVR placement.)  As another reviewer noted: plug in and check all of your camera cables BEFORE you run them to ensure that they work correctly.  One of mine didn't.Also, the system uses separate power bricks for the DVR and the cameras, so wherever you set it up, you'll need more than one power socket open.Trying to use a Mac computer to control the system is difficult.  I had to go through multiple restarts to get the application to run, and even then it took forever to sync up the cameras.  Trying to use a PC is even worse.  The software is buggy and crashes often.  As much as I whined about the setup of the NEST Cam, this Q-See experience has converted me.Anyway, full marks for image quality of the cameras once the system is up and running.  Minus a half for a bad cable, and minus 1.5 for the horrible software.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15K0IQU76X5KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SGC7UQ#wasThisHelpful","R15K0IQU76X5KV","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So many printers, scanners, embroidery machines, and sewing machines these days require less creativity and more computer skills.  The Brother CM350 ScanNCut is no exception.My first tip is to fully read the instructions.  The ScanNCut 2 doesn't come with an activation card -needed for wireless communions with other devices: computer, tablet, mobile phone- and doesn't come with a USB cable -required for use with computer if you don't have the activation card.  That pretty much ticked me off right out of the gate.  So while it says ""wireless ready"" and ""cloud-based"" blah blah, that's all useless unless you have your own way to connect it to a computer.Getting the machine set up and through its first cutting job isn't particularly easy.  But, after doing it once, it's not too tough going forward.The cutting results are pretty good. I can see this being useful for decorations, quilting patterns, sewing patterns, or even helping the kids with project work.Now the negatives are easily overcome, so really, it's more about how easily annoyed you are.  If easily annoyed by not-included parts, marketing rhetoric, or techno-speak, you should likely stay away.  If you can all that in stride and need machine that will cut out paper doilies for you, give it a whirl.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3WRPXT7TFHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014T1CI1E#wasThisHelpful","RN3WRPXT7TFHH","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a klutz.  I drop my phone at least once a day.  So, when I bought my new iPhone 6S Plus, I insisted on getting the toughest protection possible for it: The OtterBox Defender.I've been using OtterBox products to protect my iPhones since I had the iPhone 4.  They've protected my electronics from myself time and again.The Otterbox Defender for iPhone 6 Plus/6S Plus is tough. First, it wraps your iPhone in a tough polycarb shell that has built-in screen protection.  Then, that hard shell gets wrapped in another layer of firm, rubber-like silicon; it acts like a rubber bumper: shock absorption.  All the ports (save the camera) are covered by thick flaps of the silicon bumper.I've already dropped by more phone more than a dozen times, and it still looks & acts like it's new.However...The flaps covering the ports are a pain.  Especially the one covering the Lightning connector.  I wrestle with it every night when trying to charge my phone. Sure, it's great for protection, but lousy for letting me access the port!I hate the built in screen protector. It messes with Touch ID just enough to annoy me from time to time and the plastic attracts oils and dust like a magnet.  Worse, it's a pain to clean.And of course: This case makes a huge phone even LARGER.  I can shim it into my back pocket, but just barely.  And while, yes, there's a belt clip, that's huge too!  Its like walking around with a stack of CDs glued to my hip.Personally, I tore the built in screen protector off and got one of the Tempered Glass screen protectors.  It's easier to see through, easier to work with, and a simple wipe with a t-shirt cleans it off.  Plus, since the Defender has high beveled edges, the screen is well protected.Anyway, in spite of the drawbacks, this is still the best protection for your iPhone 6S Plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROGDQYF5IZ0NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SX51Q#wasThisHelpful","ROGDQYF5IZ0NR","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The function keys are odd and don't seem to map correctly, and the volume controls don't work on a Mac2. This is NOT Bluetooth.

"First up: only stainless steel touches the contents of the Stanley Classic Growler.  That's good for multiple reasons, but most importantly: it won't impact taste!Next up: will it keep your brew cold and fizzy?  Short answer: yep.  Long answer: I washed mine out, rinsed it well, and filled it with ice water.  I let that sit for an hour to pre-chill the Growler.  I then filled the Growler with 64 ounces of ice cold beer. (That's a bit over five 12-ounce beers.)  Closed the lid, sealed it up, and let it sit on the kitchen counter for 24 hours.  When I opened it, the beer was still cold and still fizzy.Of course, this is just letting it sit untouched for a day.  If you were to open it up after 8 hours, drain off 24 ounces, seal it up... then repeat... the brew that's left will wind a tad on the flat side because: the beer will continue to bubble inside the growler, and with all that space to fill up... you get the idea.  If the growler had a way of injecting CO2 to pressurize its contents, that would be fantastic and keep everything fizzy.

"Ethernet ports have become a rarity on new laptops.  But. whether it's for speed or security or whathaveyou, there are some times when a wired connection is a necessity.Most USB-based Ethernet adapters are hobbled by their insistence on sticking with USB 2.0.  USB 2.0 speeds just aren't enough to get you to real Gigabit speeds.  Thankfully, the TP-Link TL-UE300 uses USB 3.0 protocols which allow it to get (really close to) Gigabit speeds.I tested this dongle on an ASUS laptop (Windows 7), a Dell laptop (Windows 8) and two MacBook Pros (one Yosemite, and one El Capitan).  All four machines recognized the dongle allowed me to use it with minimal fuss. (Well, as minimal as Win8 allows for...)As for the dongle itself, the USB connector tucks neatly into the main plastic body.  This means that the connector should stay clean(ish) and the whole thing is easily tucked away in your laptop bag if you should ever need it.All that said: the main body (that houses the Ethernet port and electronics) is pretty thin plastic.  If I had a fat enough piece of heat-shrink tube, I'd wrap the thing for a bit of added protection.

"Take an Apple Airport Extreme, make it less flexible, paint it a pretty color, and you have the OnHub Wireless Router made by TP-LINK and marketed by Google.Both the OnHub and Airport Extreme require you to use an app on a device to program them.  Still, I'd give Apple the edge here as the Airport phone app is pretty intuitive; plus you can use the more ""deep"" desktop app with Airport. With OnHub: you have to use the phone app.Both devices use the most recent (as of January 2014) IEEE 802.11 set and SHOULD allow device throughput of up to 500 megabits per second.  Neither device actually hits that mark, and in my tests the OnHub was erratic.  Not only did its throughput speeds never get close to 500 Mbit/s, single-device speeds wavered greatly.The 802.11ac protocol set allows for multi-channel binding; meaning that the device should maintain a stable, fast connection even through walls as long you're within range.  But the OnHub router doesn't seem to use multi-channel binding; instead switching from 5GHz to 2.4GHz quickly, and then down to a single 20MHz channel. (Instead of other current routers that bind two 20MHz channels together for a 40MHz band.)OnHub claims (on their website: https://on.google.com/hub/) that you can get faster speeds, but I didn't see it.The whole ""speaks your language"" thing is pretty neat.  But I can see how it might annoy some folks.Honestly, the tech of the OnHub doesn't justify the price tag.  There are many other non-pretty wireless routers out there that will give you better performance at a lower price-point.

"Right so.  This is a camera for monitoring your home or office.The Nest Cam connects to the Internet via WiFi, so if you want to use it, you need to have Wireless Internet to hook it into.  And yes, Internet access is REQUIRED. No, you can't just hook it into your local area network and monitor it that way.  It uses the Internet connection to sync up to Nest's (aka Google's) servers.  Those servers then server your video to you over the Nest App.Yes, you not only MUST have Internet for this to work, you must also use their app on your iPhone or Android phone.All that aside, the camera itself will give you an image from 360 pixels tall to 1080 tall. The camera also features: - Mic & speaker - so you can listen in and talk to folks through the camera - Night vision - so you can watch what's happening even at night - Digital zoom - just pinch to zoom on your phoneWhile the camera is powered via USB, don't think that you can hook it into your computer and use it that way... cuz that doesn't work either.The camera gets warm, but not overly hot.Now, the app:  The app gets 3 stars.  It takes FOREVER to initialize, FOREVER to find the Nest Cam, and is more finicky than a spoiled cat.  It drops signal for no apparent reason.  Oh, and worse:  If I get a notification that the camera picked up sound or movement and I don't check immediately: it won't load.  I then have to go to the live feed and search back to see the event.Worse of all: if you want to keep more than 12 hours of footage, you need to subscribe their service for $100 a year.

So, I've been using newspaper and olive oil to start my briquettes in a chimney starter for years now.And now we have these Aura All Natural Fire Starters.  Per the instructions, I used 3 to start my charcoal. It took a few matches to get the starters going, but once they were burning, they did the job.These do seem a bit pricey when compared to leftover newspaper and a few drops of olive oil.

"So, right out of the box: these things look beefy.  Nice grip pattern, heavy material, and decent flexibility.However...  I wear medium sized gloves (as a motorcycle rider, I'm well versed in what size gloves I wear) and have slightly pudgy hands/thick fingers.  I found these cumbersome to get on and peel off again.  My wife (who also wears medium gloves, but has dainty hands) has no problem putting these on or taking them off again.  All this to say: slight warning on the fit.Next up: They work well.  For temps at 400 or less, these saved my hands from heat.  Better still, because they are silicone, they block moisture.  No steam, no boiling water, no beefy roast juice is going to soak through and burn me.  That said, I prefer to use these outdoors, as opposed to in the kitchen.Their 425 degree max heat rating means that I need to be careful around my charcoal grill (which can hit temps in excess of 600 degrees) but they are just too perfect for grilling to not use.  Their grippy exterior means that tools and tongs are easily manipulated.  They deftly block heat from the grill as work over it.  And I drop a glove, I can hose it off and keep going.I like em.  Besides the fit issue, my only problem is fighting with the wife over where they live; by the grill or by the stove.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3P39CQRJT1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPQBZFE#wasThisHelpful","R3O3P39CQRJT1Y","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, first up: don't freak out because of the word ""palm"" in this sweetener.  This isn't the dreaded deforestation for palm oil that's destroying Borneo, Malaysia, etc.  They tap the coconut tree similar to how they tap maple trees.Anyway, as sweeteners go, this stuff is pretty heavy tasting.  The bottle claims to have a flavor like ""rich caramel.""  In my opinion, the flavor is more like molasses.  It tastes NOTHING like coconut.  It's a complex and rich flavor that I just LOVE in coffee.Ok, the bottle also claims this is a ""low glycemic"" sweetener.  That's pretty dang true.  As best as I could dig up poking around the Internet, Coconut palm syrup has a glycemic load about 1/4 that of white table sugar.  (If you find more liable information, let me know!)And lastly: gluten free.  Well, since they don't use any thickeners nor additives, there are no grains nor starches to add gluten in.You'll likely notice that I've glossed over the ""organic"" labeling.  Without knowing the country of origin (there's no information about where this stuff is actually from, just who the distributor is) there's no real way of gauging how truthful the ""organic"" label is.Besides putting it in my coffee, I've also used it as: a replacement for honey in Honey & Balsamic Glaze, a replacement for brown sugar in various glazes and sauces for fish and pork, and as a replacement for molasses in my own barbeque sauce.  It adds wonderful complexity to everything I've put it in.I suppose that for most folks the important bits are: tastes like light molasses and actually is low glycemic & gluten free.

"The short version:It's bright, comes with its own batteries & charger, is easy to operate with gloves on, and works well.The long version:The Phantom Aquatics Impulse 1500 is sturdy, heavy, and comes with all the accessories most would want to use.I let the batteries charge up for 3 hours, but I wasn't paying attention, so they could have taken less time.No instructions were included, so I just guessed at how to take it apart... grip the light/control end with one hand, grip the handle with the other and twist.  It worked, but sure did take a while to unscrew.There are three separate O rings in the assembly to ensure water proofing. They are lubricated, and while extra O rings are supplied, no additional silicon lubricant is included.  So if you do need to swap one out, I hope you have some of your own.This is a seriously heavy beast.  Underwater it won't be a chore.  But on dry land, it might get cumbersome.

You switch through the brightness levels by pressing the large, easy-to-use switch.The flashlight comes in a padded plastic case with the light, batteries, charger, lanyard and strap.

"The Drop Tech V2 case for iPhone 6 Plus is serious protection for your Precious.  It's the first case I've ever seen that can compare with the armoring offered by Otterbox, and that's a huge compliment.Personally, I *am* a klutz.  I drop my iPhone at least once every other day.  Heck, in a restaurant, I once flung it two tables over... by accident!  My iPhone 3 was face down on asphalt not 1 hour after I'd purchased it; but yeah, I had it in a case 45 minutes before that happened.Anywho, the Drop Tech V2 is a Gumdrop case made of two protective layers: an inner hard plastic shell (with built in screen protection) and a softer outer shell. It even comes with a 3rd layer: a beefy belt clip.The packaging claims ""Mil Spec"" protection, but I'm not sure about that.  Why?  The camera and lens on the back are fully exposed.  Likewise the camera and sensor on the front and the main sound port (so you can hear your phone ring) are also completely left open to the elements.  So, don't go thinking you can take your phone out into a sandstorm, and definitely don't drop it in a toilet as the Drop Tech V2 will *not* help in those instances.That said, for a goof like me, this case is still golden.  I'm guessing they named it the ""Drop Tech"" on purpose, knowing that folks like me drop their phones.  And for that purpose, this case is excellent.I'm not completely sold on the included belt clip.  The case itself makes my phone even more gigantic that it already is, the belt clip just magnifies that effect.  Of course, if the case makes it impossible for you to put your phone in your pocket, then perhaps the belt clip is just what you need.  Still... you'll be strapping a 5x7 hunk of metal/glass/plastic/PTE to your hip.  It's definitely not fashion-forward.The belt clip is still quite useful as it also works as a stand; useful for watching videos or when using external input to the iPhone.Yes, the case is big and bulky.

"Let me just start by asking this question:How can Curt charge so little for such a high quality product?I'll let you read up on the specs of the Curt Cargo Carrier, but there were a few things that I felt the need to REALLY test:1. 500 pound load capacity2. Folding shank3. Fit & finishFirst thing I did was hook this puppy onto my SUV.  Now, with a factory install 2"" x 2"" receiver, I have no worries about my rig being able to hold the weight of the Cargo Carrier & its contents.  If you aren't so lucky, check to make sure that your after-market tow receiver will handle the weight and that your vehicle can handle it.  Tossing over 500 pounds of dead weight past your rear bumper *will* affect ride and handling; so be safe out there!Anyway, the Curt Cargo Carrier slotted in with no issues.  Locking down was easy and firm; it'll wiggle a bit, but not rattle or shake.  A quick inspection showed me that all surfaces are well coated, all bolts are accessible should I need to tighten anything down. Good fit & finish.The folding mechanism works like a snap... however, when folded up it's impossible to even open my rear door; when it's folded down it's impossible to get at the rear cargo without:Standing on it.I'm a big guy; 200 pounds.

"Remember when mousepads were just thick neoprene with a thin plastic or cloth covering glued on top?This is not that mousepad.Since optical mice (mouses?) have moved away from visible red laser to not-visible lasers, the woes of working on a glossy or reflective surface have slipped away.  Tracking on these new ubermice is smooth regardless of the surface upon which they are used.  Or is it?In my own experiences with several brand-name ubermice, the surface that the mouse works on makes a large difference.Being 100% honest, I haven't played twitch-reflex games (Battlefield, League, CoD) in a few years; however, I do use my mouse for video and audio editing purposes.  Being able to quickly track in using the whole mouse before dialing in with a wheel/dot/dial saves me time and stress.  The Turtle Beach Drift mousepad helps me a lot.Anyone familiar with ""swipe/stop/creep"" will find this mousepad useful.  The pad's surface is smooth but tactile.  The underside is herringbone silicon or rubber and does not let the pad move.  The anti-fray whipstich edge may look like a bit of overkill, but with heavy use, I can see it being a major plus.Since it comes rolled up, I expected it to stay bumpy for a day or two.  It, however, relaxed into totally flat in the span of an hour.Yes, it's large.  For gamers, the extra space is quite useful for large sweeping moves.

Instead of having to vise-grip hold two horizontal handles to clamp onto the bottle, the Artaste has you, basically, holding the bottle.  The ""clamp"" here has you holding a vertical position, which is much more natural.Need instructions?  Here:1. Remove the foil from the bottle. (but NOT with the included foil cutter)2. Raise the Artaste's lever, bringing the corkscrew all the way up3. Position the Artaste on the bottle so the corkscrew is directly on top of the cork.4. Grip the clamp with one hand so that the Artaste is ""locked"" onto the bottle.5. Lower the lever, driving the corkscrew into the cork.6. Raise the level, pulling the cork.7. Done.If you'd like to easily remove the cork from the corkscrew:1. Release the clamp so that it is fully open2. Lower the lever fully so the cork is inside the clamp (like you'd position the unit for storage)3. Grip the clamp so that it ""locks"" onto the cork.4. Raise the lever.5.

"I've already written up a glowing review of the D'Addario American Stage Instrument cable... I did so a few years back.  It went something like this:""Buy this cable. Stop looking at other brands. Stop wondering if you'll get the best bang for your buck. You won't find a better quality cable than the American Stage cable.You'll likely spend years and hundreds of dollars finding and tuning the perfect instrument for you. You'll then spend hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars on the perfect amp. ...And then you'll complain about spending $25 on an instrument cable.I know. I've done that.  But if you spend all that money on the perfect axe, and all that money on the perfect amp, shouldn't you invest in some quality cables to connect the two?The connectors on the American Stage cable really do sit better. And the cable itself is tough and study.""None of that has changed.  (What did change is the name.  Planet Waves was the name on the packaging at the time, but D'Addario has since unified its marketing.)  The cable is still awesome.  Mine took a hit from a Manhasset music stand and is still rockin' just fine.  The connectors are still fantastic and seat well.The new trick here is the momentary kill switch.  Like most electric musicians who use pedals, I have a kill switch pedal at the end of my signal line in case something self-oscillates (*coughSeaMachinecough*).  It's very handy.  But that's not what this kill switch is for.The kill switch in the American Stage cable is for when you change instruments.  Yes, if you have an in-line kill switch pedal, you can use that.  But if you don't, this is quite handy.The trick is: the switch is momentary.  That means:Momentary Switch; noun. A type of switch usually in the form of a push button that is only engaged while it is being depressed, as opposed to a typical âon/offâ switch, which latches in its set position.So, when you push the button, the signal is ""killed."" Once you release the button, the signal is live again.If you're going to use this feature, if makes sense to plug the kill switch end into your guitar.It's handy and works well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLIN8YQ69CLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXF30IK#wasThisHelpful","RKLIN8YQ69CLP","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""When God Becomes Small"" Phil Needham has presented an intriguing look at modern society and how God does and doesn't fit in.There are signs and ads all around us telling us to buy more, to do more, to be more.  But how does that stack up against God's wishes for us?Needham does a wonderful job of reminding us that a large number of (dare I say ""most""?) Christians have forgotten or overlooked Jesus' teachings... you know, the guy for whom the religion is named. Needham also reminds us that Jesus was countercultural; that He shook up the church and government, and was, essentially: a hippie.Take an afternoon and read this book.

"I got it to work.First, let me say that while this Belkin Keyboard Case says that it's for iPad Air & iPad Air 2, it's not really.  It's for the iPad Air 2, as the iPad Air is thicker and takes serious work to get mounted in the case.  Even then, I felt like I was going to either break the case or my iPad.Anyway, lots of folks have written reviews about the troubles this Keyboard case has given them.  For me, it just wouldn't stay connected via Bluetooth to my iPad.  So:Step 1. Update IOS.  I know, I know... Belkin says that IOS 7.2 and later is supported, but apparently you need IOS 8.1 or later.Step 2. Reset/clear the keyboard: press and hold the iOS Home key, Function key, Delete, and the Right Arrow key for five secondsOnce I followed those two steps, I've had no technical issues with it.Other stuffs:I like the keys on the keyboard.  While it's all very compact, they feel like quality laptop keys with good throw response.  The magnets that hold thing shut and hold the iPad up for keyboard use are strong, but not overly so.  And whatever material is coating the outside is pretty grippy; meaning, the whole thing doesn't slide around when typing.Once I got over the connection issues, I've been pretty happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCTVH2D3WJ67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0M4YCO#wasThisHelpful","R3GCTVH2D3WJ67","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm surprised.Usually, any ""drying lotion"" causes my skin to turn red and peel.  But Acnefree Drying Lotion is very gentle. Per the instructions, dip a cotton swab into the jar, down to the pink sediment near the bottom, then apply. I'd recommend doing this about an hour or so before bedtime.  It'll give the lotion time to work into your skin so you don't leave it all over your pillow.For me, it worked on a troublesome blocked pore overnight without causing my skin to rebel angrily.

"Step One: Read the included instructions.Step Two: See Step One.You know how most electronic devices with batteries pre-installed will have a little plastic tab that you can pull to quickly remove the plastic with no fuss?  Well, Taylor wanted me to burn some calories before I even used this scale. They had me to go to the garage and get a small phillips-head screwdriver to take the battery cover off, so I could then remove the plastic thingy.Very thoughtful of them.  I'm sure I burned 15 calories in that little adventure.Anyway, I can't imagine anyone figuring out this scale without the instructions.  So please read them, again and again.  Thankfully, they are written in plain English... well, as plain as anyone can get with a piece of electronic technology.You can have this scale hold the information for up to 4 people.  Each can then pull up their data, weigh themselves, and see how they are doing.After entering your personal data and weighing yourself, the scale will give you a number that you can then look up in the included BMI table and then feel very, very badly about yourself.The scale itself doesn't judge you. It gives you the tools to do that to yourself.  Again, very thoughtful.The Body Mass Index table included in the instructions does not distinguish between men and women... but the scale itself does want to know your gender.  I'm guessing that the scale takes everything into consideration when making its calculations so that you don't have to look at two different tables.Oh, this is just a scale with a calculator in it... it does *not* use bio-resistance measuring to determine your BMI number.The scale is accurate.  Well, it's as accurate as the other two scales in my house.Anyway: Pro Tips!Pro Tip One: Read the instructions.Pro Tip Two: Set the scale on a LEVEL hard surface (no rugs nor carpet)Pro Tip Three: Don't feel too bad.

"It's tough reviewing towels as so much is subjective. Softness, absorbency, texture, color... all are subject to the preferences and whims of the user.  (And before you quibble over Absorbency: talk to someone 6'5"" and 250 pounds, then talk to someone 5'2"" and 100 pounds)Anyway, I received the towel set in ""green"" and found the green to be a yellow-green, or even a tan-green.  They were soft out of the box, and remained so after washing.  Not what I'd call ""plush"" nor ""luxurious"" but still soft.  They're a looped pile texture... so plan on them snagging on something at some point... but don't all towels do that?Honestly, they're very towel-like.  I'm sure that the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy would approve of the largest towels in the pack (the bath towels) as something you might take traveling.  Not that there's anything wrong with the hand towels nor the washcloths, but you definitely couldn't use either of those as a blanket... unless you were very small indeed.The Mills ""Naked"" 6-piece bath set ticks all the boxes as far as towels go, but aren't amazingly fantastically wondrous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32OYQKOU6YH30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OB9CV5S#wasThisHelpful","R32OYQKOU6YH30","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had to sum up my review in one word, it would be: Unimpressive.The photos make this small flask (holds 6-ish ounces) look stylish and cool.  Good marketing there, because when you get up close with the Metrokane/Rabbit Hip flask, it sure falls short. 1. The rubber or silicon or whathaveyou strip on the flask is not fitted well.  It bulges in some spots, not in others.  Mine won't even stand up on its own for filling. 2. The stainless steel has sharp edges.  Mine looks like someone took a hammer to the top edge to flatten it out; leaving protruding sharp edges. Just what I always wanted: a flask that will cut me every time I want a sip. 3. The screwtop cap is gray plastic (i.e.; ugly) and releases from the ""tether"" with minimal force.As anyone who owns stainless steel appliances will tell you: touch it once and you've left a mark.  Very true here as well.And, as another reviewer noted, mine arrived smelling of 3-in-1 Oil.Oh, and can I just say, using this as a marketing line: ""Sneak it in your purse for some swigs on the go"" sounds like Metrokane is enabling alcoholics.  Well, it sounds like that to me... and I used to write Marketing.Anyway:  It's a pain to clean.  Smells off.  Doesn't hold much.  Wants to cut me.

"Short Version:  It does it's job.Long Version:I bake a chicken a week.  The leftovers go into chicken salad or pot pies, so for me it just makes sense.  Getting the whole bird out of the roasting pan without making a mess has always been a touch problematic.  I use the ""big fork"" from a carving set to get the bird out and usually wind up burning my hand on the edge of the roasting pan, spilling juices, or both.The OXO Poultry Lifter *does* keep me from burning my hand on the roasting pan.  Since the handle is positioned OVER the bird, there's no need to get my hand down near the pan.Still, lifting a bird using this gizmo is awkward at first and takes some getting used to.

"So, for most of my adult life, if I bought an electric heater, it has been a DeLonghi Heater.  This is because, in my experience, they are built to last and are reliable.That said, this is the first DeLonghi heater that I've owned in which the housing is 100% plastic.  Initially, this caused me concern because typically, Heat + Plastic = Toxic Fumes.  But not here.  The HVY1030 barely let off any ""first time start up"" smells at all.  And that was nice.Also nice is the fact that it's a metal coil heater.  It heats up quickly and gets the job done.  I've used it in a small bathroom (about 70 square feet) and a small bedroom (about 130 square feet) and it has performed well.The ""thermostat"" is one of those dials where you get your room up the desired temperature and then back the dial down until the heater stops; the heater then knows what temp you want your room and will work to keep it there.The heater has Low, High, and Fan settings.  Fan, obviously, just turns the fan on...but strangely, you must still use the Thermostat dial to kick the Fan on.  Low is nice and works well in small spaces.  High is dang hot and heats up small rooms quickly.I've seen reviews of people saying that this heater just doesn't get hot enough.  Either those people are made of asbestos or obsidian, or they aren't cranking this sucker up.  There is always the possibility that they are using it in too small of a space or have the heater up against a wall.  If you do either, it will shut itself off pretty quickly as the coils won't have fresh air to heat.At any rate, I've found it perfect to heat up small rooms and it doesn't let off nasty smells.  It's a keeper!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QM4BSF6X3ID8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KD9XKA#wasThisHelpful","R1QM4BSF6X3ID8","A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LH6RF4UN9VI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story of the prisoner exchange involving Francis Gary Powers is one of unending tension broken just occasionally by little humorous comments.  Tom Hanks plays the lawyer defending the Russian spy that was eventually traded for U-2 pilot Powers.  The negotiations are complicated and could have been tedious in the hands of a lesser cast and director. Hanks is completely believable as an intelligent but ordinary man thrust into global affairs; he's a pleasure to watch.  We get to know and, to some degree, sympathize with the Russian spy and Powers is certainly a likable character, shot down on his first spy mission.  Very entertaining and educational film.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVWYWOABP3GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HM3E8K#wasThisHelpful","R2FVWYWOABP3GS","A2GPEV42IO41CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GPEV42IO41CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Turner's later life is portrayed in a series of often unrelated vignettes, showing his deep love for his father, his loyal housekeeper, his famous artist colleagues, and his lady love, but mostly it showcases his blustery, growling, nasty personality.Timothy Spall does an excellent job of conveying Turner's irascibility; he is forever grunting and groaning and getting away with it because of his wonderful talent.  The movie is filmed in such glorious colors that each scene looks like an oil painting by a  master; visually this film is a delight.  The 19th century sets and costumes are also perfect. On the down side, each scene begins intriguingly but goes nowhere; there is no continuity or build-up to a dramatic end. But it is the man himself, Turner, that I found so utterly loathsome that I can't recommend the movie.  It does show many of his art works but everything is secondary to the repulsive blowhard himself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZW6G8LWGKID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBFMCW8#wasThisHelpful","R3MZW6G8LWGKID","A2GPEV42IO41CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GPEV42IO41CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chris and Emily grew up as neighbors, playmates, best buddies, and later, high school sweethearts.  They were two halves of a whole, people said.  And then ,one night, they had a gun and their lives exploded.The basic plot is a very good one and the author, for the most part, writes engagingly.  A lot of it was can't-put-it-down-good, but unfortunately, a lot of it was just filler.  At 500 pages, the book is about 200 pages too long.  There are endless (and ultimately pointless) pages of courtroom testimony that I found dull.  Worse than that, the (non-) ending:  It was such a disappointment!  We waited all this time to find out WHY and then, sorry, reader, you lose!The descriptions of Chris and Emily's developing romance and the backstories of their parents were all very interesting and I found the jail scenes especially riveting.

With his innate genteel sophistication and noble appearance, he sounded ridiculous saying the Woody Allen dialogue.  Emma Stone looked like a little girl with a big lisp and was totally annoying.

Yvette Mimieux was perfectly cast as the fragile and beautiful woman who will never grow up.  On the other hand, I couldn't buy George Hamilton as an Italian stud-muffin; he looked ridiculous and the love-at-first-sight plot was unbelievable.While the scenery of Florence was lovely, the print quality was very poor and almost unwatchable.

It seems a shame to put a pillow case over it, but it's easier to wash and replace a pillow case than wrestle with the snug-fitting zippered case.It's a heavy pillow, but medium firmness and very comfortable.

It is not a replacement for a full-size upright; the power is less and the small suction area means going over the same spot several times.

The vacuum does not roll on four wheels; it feels like pushing a heavy book across the floor with a yard stick.I would much rather use the hand-held vac part for small clean-ups.

As usual, he's being followed by the deadly Talon who is, in turn, controlled by the mysterious Seven.  Will Michael live to find the Ark?!This book wasn't nearly as much fun as Book 1; the writing was the same (despite a new co-author), but the plot involved so many ridiculously implausible action scenes - Michael accomplishes things no one else in history has ever done - and he does them soooo easily.There is some preaching in this book, as a character considers becoming a Christian.

"This is my Filipina wife's 3rd winter here and she just could not stand looking at another several months of cold toilet seats.  Our bathroom is not central heated, so it stays much colder than the rooms we stay in most of the time unless we turn on the heater.  That does not help on short toilet trips.  She yelled from the bathroom a couple of weeks ago asking if there was any kind of cover for the cold toilet seat.Well shame on me!  Of course there are covers and I should have had one that first winter.  I looked through the Amazon and Walmart sites and this was the ONLY cover that looked nice, a little padding as well... so I ordered one.But you can't tell from the photo that the UNDERSIDE of the toilet seat is very nice looking as well... compared to the other types of covers at least.  No it's not smooth like a sleeve, there's no way to do that, but it is totally covered with just a neat ring around the middle.  It kind of snaps into place with the spring ring you poke through the top and then wrap it around so the elastic outer edge covers the bottom up to where the spring ring is.  It's very nice.. no straps, no clips... just a nice, clean looking cover.  I was going to say it looks just like the picture, but actually mine fits better than that one.  Top Marks.Of course it's new, so we will have to see how well it washes, if it stains, or if it doesn't maintain the elastic hem, but I'm fairly certain I'll be ordering at least one more, and I won't be exploring all of the cheaper ones that are not in the same quality category at all.It arrived in one week, unlike most of the listings that come from China in a month or more.

"5 stars for VALUE, meaning that I am not comparing this ""starter"" phone to flagship iPhones or Samsungs, etc.  If you are looking for a top of the line phone, you know already that you are in the wrong place.What the Dash M will do for you:1.  Good phone circuitry that allows you to talk to anyplace your provider allows, plus text to your heart's content.  You can download apps like SwiftKey to make typing a little better if you want, but actually it texts just as well as almost any Android on the market.2.  Social Media works well if you have a data subscription3.  Browse the web, but pretty much only one site, maybe two at a time, since you do have a limited Random Access Memory (RAM).  It will go as fast as your provider will allow... it does not do LTE of course, but for web pages you won't notice the difference.  For videos, it should work ok in most cases.4.  Music will work fine, and sound fine through earbuds.  Only problem here is lack of storage memory, but you can add an SD card and store just about all the music you could ever need.  A simple 8GB SD card costs 3 to 4 dollars and will hold a LOT of music... and I think you can use cards 8 times bigger if you want to carry around a whole library of every song you have ever heard.5.  Games... yes it will play simple games just fine... Don't expect to play online shooters with your friends, but simple games, yeah.6.  You can download and use almost any app available and there are thousands to choose from.What it will NOT do:1.  It will not work for a long time without a charge.  It has a small battery and will need charging every night at the very LEAST.  If you listen to music or play games all day, you will need to plug the charger in often.  Or step up to the Blu Energy X for $40 more and get almost 5 times as big of a battery.2.  You will need to get a good case and screen protector.  This is the first Blu that did not include those items, but I  guess that's part of why the price is low.  Just remember most high priced phones don't include those things either.Recommendations:  If you don't need to play high speed games or to do intricate stuff, this phone should work just fine for you at a price that will not bring tears if you lose or break the phone.  You will need to remember to charge the battery and learn good RAM procedures to keep unused apps from eating your battery.  Great for teens or even kids, also good for gramma or someone that just needs to phone and text and maybe message on Facebook.For the money, this phone should not disappoint you.  I plan to give it to my 8yo if he can show me a good report card next month.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6M8D0NF8QP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01730B2C4#wasThisHelpful","R2S6M8D0NF8QP9","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product itself is fine for what it's designed to do.  Easy to understand if you understand electrical wiring at all, easy to operate and diagnose any issues.  I give the product FIVE STARS and I give the design and production groups a medal for achievement.The packaging and information group gets fired.  While there is ample room on the INSIDE of the flip open card, it is blank, and out falls an EXTRA sheet of paper telling you to look on the internet... it tells only the sperryinstruments.com  website and NOT the actual URL for the supposed manual you are promised on the tiny sheet of paper.  Well, THERE IS NO MANUAL on that website, only sales info, once you find the product.  There is a sales video that shows it working, which is slightly informative, but not much else.  You actually have to work pretty much from the info offered on the Amazon site and your own knowledge and intuition.

"Set-up on this was a frustrating affair.  The quick start fails to tell you anything about how to load paper, you learn that on the tiny LCD screen and it is tiny, goes by too fast to understand and is difficult to get the idea.  Punching in your router password is done like an old fashioned cellphone, with abc def, etc.  archaic.  Should be done from the computer setup.  I got very upset.Used on a brand new ASUS M32 using windows 10 operating system.First let me talk about the OUTSTANDING advantage of wireless printing:  In the past, each time Windows jumped to a new O/S, I have had to buy a new scanner.  Those are days of the past now, because with this all-in-one running WiFi, the O/S doesn't make much difference.  So if you have a scanner you like, you don't have to put it away and buy a new one.  Obviously too, the other advantages include printing from your laptop, tablet or even your phone.  And of course, no danged wires.The printer is slow compared to my great HP8100, but not that bad, plus it responds even from cold very quickly.  Photo quality is the BEST of any printer I've owned, but very very slow... that's ok, if I don't need quality I can use the other printer or degrade it on the software.I have not used the autofeed on the scanner yet, but normal scanning is simple and results are clear and quick.  That will probably be my main use for this unit.  It is very much like using a Xerox, but better quality.The only fax I've received was the test fax they sent me on setup, but it ""looks like a fax""... not much more I can say about that.Overall, other than my temper tantrum when I set the thing up, mainly because it just didn't seem organized and I thought the paper feed would be a little more modern than a stack of 30 sheets or less standing up from the back, illustrations on the tiny LCD screen on the printer itself rather than anything printed or online, and trying to read the quick start flyer, the manual and the online setup instructions all at the same time....... I really like this printer a lot.  I apologize to HP for expecting more, but for under $80, it is not bad at all.  Ink cartridges are tiny, obviously because they want you to sign up for the subscription service... if this was my only printer I would probably do that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WB7NKH09YP9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SKI4EM#wasThisHelpful","R2WB7NKH09YP9H","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have waited for my wife to put on make-up so she could use this product to remove it.  Yesterday she sat at her make-up station and tried out several of her new eye applications (different bases and one with glitter that she's used before) and said for me to give this full marks.  She was very pleased with the efficient way it took off the make-up and cleaned her face (multiple times) and was pleased that she did not need to rinse afterward.  Today she says she felt NO discomfort with her face and she is totally pleased with it and will buy this brand from now on.Side Note:  She does have problems with facial blemishes from time to time, so I will report that if she feels it is the fault of this product, but as of now she says she is not worried that could happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9I1Q3Z0IT3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q388UK#wasThisHelpful","R3C9I1Q3Z0IT3U","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is NOT a Vine review.  I paid $429 for this computer just like everyone else.  This review is totally spontaneous, no gilded edges, no embellishment, no BS.Disclaimer:  After saying the above comment, need to say I have only been using this computer for a week and I am still downloading and installing programs and apps that I am comfortable with.  I will continue to update as I find things I like or dislike, along with remedies or work-arounds.  Since this will be my prime computer, and because I spend 10 hours or so a day pecking away at it, I cannot tolerate things that don't work.  Some of my complaints will NOT be the fault of the hardware or software ASUS used, but will be caused by experiencing the Windows 10 system for the first time, as well as general difficulties installing the various apps and dingleberries required.Also please note that this is for the M32 that has Windows 10 preinstalled.  It will update further automatically during setup.  Mine took almost no time at all to update.  I say this mainly to let buyers know that this review is NOT for the 8.1 version that had to be fully updated, so rest easy and maybe skip over those reviews complaining about issues related to the update... you will not experience that problem.Initial Review:I was a bit worried when this unit arrived that there was not an instruction manual.  Every other computer I've bought since the first one in 1982 have had details so complex that I had to study it carefully before turning the thing on, and then to troubleshoot various difficulties.  THE M32CD REQUIRES NO MANUAL!  Instead, there is just a little sheet with 5 steps for setup:  (1) Plug in the Keyboard and Mouse (I used my old ones rather than the ones included), (2) Connect the monitor cable, (3) Connect the LAN cable or make sure your wireless router is on, (4) Connect the power cord and plug it into the wall, (5) Push the big power button on the front.  ASUS and Windows will guide you through the rest of the setup.Minor Difficulties Encountered:  Due to the ASUS hard drive formatting, there is a C: drive which is only 149GB containing all of the system software, etc.  and a 780GB D: drive for your data, music, videos, games, etc.  I saw nothing to warn me that my downloads would go to the C: drive unless I otherwise intervened. So I had to move a few things manually onto the D: drive.  If I'd known I could inform the computer to do that automatically, it would have saved a little trouble.  Back in the Vista days I had many hard drives installed, so I'm OK with using something like that, but it would have been nice to be prepared for it.Things I Like:1.  Since I hated a Windows 8 unit I bought a couple of years ago and returned it, buying a cheaper W7 unit instead, I'm happy to report that I had no problem adapting to most of the Windows 10 rituals.2.  Even with (now) most of my applications installed and working, the ASUS/W-10 is noticeably faster, with a brighter, sharper display (and I'm using the same monitor as before, so this must be related to the onboard graphics).3.  For the first time on a desktop, I have Bluetooth, so I can use my high quality, comfortable QY8 Bluetooth headset and eliminate lap wires... that's a big yay!  Of course the strength of the Bluetooth signal is dependent on both units paired, but I can get up from my computer, located at the back corner of the house, walk out of the office without the wires rudely snatching the earbuds away, walk through the bedroom and into the kitchen before my headset says ""Out of range"".4.  Fairly silent.  Yes I can hear the fan, but it is not suddenly speeding up and blowing hard to cool an under-powered  AMD CPU... so far.  Maybe when things get dusty inside the  case I will see what happens.  I have not opened the case, but I understand there is no case fan, so I guess that's the reason.5.  Full sized tower case.  My last computer was a small case that did not leave much room to improve the power supply, add better graphics, or do whatever else was needed.  YES I DO SEE THE SEAL ON THE BACK that says it voids the warranty to break the seal, but that's just BS... you would have to break that seal just to vacuum the dust, so I am not worried about that at all.  Plus if I'm dumb enough to break my own computer after all of the years I've been addicted to them, then I deserve whatever retribution ASUS has planned for me.Things I DO NOT like:1.  Some of the Windows 10 stuff, especially the useless W8 squares in the ""Start Menu"" and the fact that removing one thing from the Quick Access menu adds others, and others and others ... maybe I'll find how to kill that.  Most of W-10 is intuitive and easy to figure out if you are used to W-7.2.  Many reviewers have said there is no bloatware, but some have complained about it.  You don't really see the bloat unless you are looking for it in the right place, and actually there is NOT that much... in fact, what appears to be bloat is just a link to the download.I'm sure I will find other things I don't like, it's only been a week","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGZFSJWJVTWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVM2KO#wasThisHelpful","RVGZFSJWJVTWH","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1.  This requires a full size drill press... will not fit a mini by any means.2.  There is noticeable slop in both directions that I think can be fixed somewhat.  Some slop is to be expected, but this is a bit more than I'd like.3.  Boat anchor heavy... that's a good thing.4.  Cranks are a little wobbly, but that should seldom be a problem... plus can be fixed with a washer or two.Luckily I don't have any high precision jobs at the moment, and I don't have a boat either, so I'll put it on the shelf for now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35N6UNNUX40AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015KP2FCK#wasThisHelpful","R35N6UNNUX40AO","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, I BOUGHT these earbuds at full price of $24.99.  In fact I bought two (explained below).  I did not get these at a discount or for free in return for my review... what I say below is totally spontaneous and true, no gilded edges, no embellishment, no BS.Bought these for my wife.  Paired up instantly (once I'd read the tiny instructions).  Listened for 5 minutes and ordered a pair for myself.  Best buds I've ever heard, and I have MANY.  Bass rocks (if you have one and it hasn't got bass, you don't have them in your ears properly).  Absolutely clear, phone works perfectly by pausing the music and announcing the number calling you.  Volume and fwd/back will take some practice, but they do work.  Range is about 7 meters, but that's fine because the phone can stay in my pocket or on the table/desk.  If I get up from my computer desk and walk out the door, through the MBR and into the kitchen, it starts reporting ""Out of range"" intermittently until i get far into the kitchen.  When I get to the coffee maker, the signal is gone, but it returns as I am walking back through the bedroom to the office.  If it's a football game, at least I keep up with most of what's happening... if it's an action movie, I just pause it before I go for coffee.My wife will use these for her million calls a day and listen to music on her two phones... wirelessly.  For me it is more complicated because I watch TV entirely on my computer, plus I use e-cigs... so I have toooo many wires at my desk.  This will UNcomplicate that situation.TIPS:1.  They will be hard to insert into your ears the first few times, then you will learn the positioning.  Put the AYL lighted bud into the right ear, wire pointing down, the other into the left.  Lock by holding the little horns, then pull the horns forward until the wing tab goes under the big lumps at the bottom of your ears... you will feel when it is in the right place.  The wing tabs are flexible, so it's easy to remove the buds without hurting the buds or your ears, and if you somehow snag the wire it's not locked so tight it hurts when the bud pops out of your ear.  They are just enough so that movements when doing things like jogging or exercise don't easily dislodge them.  I like this system better than the big wings used by most earbud manufacturers.2.  Opening the charging port is hard at first... just dig your nail into the top and pull it upward.  I keep a little jeweler's screwdriver near the usb charge source that I can carefully stick under the bottom edge in case my nails have been filed too short.SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS FOR QY9 MODEL:1.  Instead of the little switch for volume and skip forward/back having tiny braille bumps, please put a large enough spike or tab on it so it's easy to find and press up or down.2.  The cover for the charging port is very difficult sometimes.  I'm hoping it will get easier, but I worry that I will get so frustrated I actually pull the thing off.  It shouldn't be hard to make it thick enough to get a thumbnail under the bottom edge... possibly even a little groove there to help get a grip on it.You are not likely to be unsatisfied with these MAGNIFICENT Bluetooth Buds.  I am totally tickled with them.UPDATE after 2 hours:  Comfy.  One downside if you buy these for your wife, you'll need to wave a hand in front of her face if you want to talk to her, she can't hear you. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EPOFPAR9A4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EGE9G6#wasThisHelpful","R34EPOFPAR9A4Q","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Filipina wife gets cold easily in winter.  Often she wears two layers of clothes in the house!  So this item is VERY welcome.1.  Very SOFT !!!  So soft in fact, that once it's warm, you will lose weight because you won't want to walk to the kitchen to get something to eat.2.  Warms up quickly and can get just as warm as you would like.  Just the ""warm"" setting is perfect for my wife.3.  Big enough to cover her from shoulders to feet... but she's just 4'9""... you will probably want to go diagonal if you are taller.4.

"I am a snorkel diver and spearfisherman.  I seldom go below 6 or 8 feet.  That said, ALL of my previous watches, even the expensive ones, now LEAK after changing batteries.  The water here is already too cold for me to check for leaks, but I do trust Invicta to have tested it well enough... I have no problem with that.My problem is that, like the other review with the photo, I have slim wrists, so this watch looks pretty much like that photo on me as well.  For that reason, this watch will be used only when I'm swimming or doing something else that would damage my Seiko.The complaints about the small dials being unreadable do not seem to be a problem on the watch I received.  With my glasses on I can read them just fine, and without my glasses I would not be able to read them no matter what color the print was.  Besides, I don't care what date it is when I'm snorkeling.The strap does look like it might not like water very much, but again, I do trust Invicta to have taken care of that for me.No, I will not wear this watch every day to every occasion, but I still recommend it for you if you don't mind the large size and weight.

"UPDATE 11/5/15:  I ordered this phone as a backup for my BLU Vivo Air, since when my wife drowned her phone, it took a couple of weeks to get a new phone and set it up satisfactorily.  But, I thought... what a waste!  This is a darned nice phone, big battery, good audio... I'll just go ahead and set it up so all I have to do is slip in the SIM card and use it when needed, but I'll also load in a 16GB microSD and fill it up with music to use as a music pod... low and behold, it works great for that, without a SIM card.  It's getting more use than my main phone! Plus ""IF"" I want to play a game, browse on WiFi or take a picture... it can do that too!  So now it's hooked up to our high quality AYL QY8 Bluetooth headphones and it goes either with me or with my wife any time we want it.  Cool Deal for the price.  Too bad the NFL can't find something useful for their backup players to do while waiting. :)ORIGINAL REVIEW:As priced, this is a 5-star phone.  Obviously, if it was priced the same as flagship phones it would not be.Using this phone with an AT&T SIM card and GoPhone service, it has enough speed for most games (not all) and service is very cheap.  We live in a rural, hill country home with a metal roof and screens on porches, so finding signal is sometimes difficult with our other phones, but this one is doing just fine.  Very pleased with that!OK, the phone itself:1.  It has Lollipop 5.1.  I'm still using KitKat on my Blu Vivo Air and my wife has Lollipop 5.0 on her Zenphone2... so even at this low price, the phone is elite from the very beginning.2.  4000 mAh battery makes it almost immune from running out of battery as long as someone remembers to plug in the charger before bedtime.3.  Gorilla Glass, plus the soft case and screen protector, make this phone fairly bulletproof.4.  Sufficient CPU and RAM to pair with a large SD card will allow you to have a large number of games and music.  You might need to learn RAM management in the process, meaning turning off unused apps :)5.  720p resolution is perfectly sufficient for a 5-inch screen.  Even small text is easy to read and online graphics are just fine.6.  Cameras are a bit sub-optimal, but surprisingly sufficient .  2 megapixel selfies require careful framing and stability, 8 megapixel main camera makes carefully snapped photos look pretty good with practice.  You might be surprised how many people don't know their camera can do more than snap a grainy photo... the software included can do a good job, plus there are apps available to improve it even more.7.  Being an Android phone, there are all sorts of games and fun apps, plus learning apps.  This phone will keep a teen entertained and thirsty to learn new things.So for the price I paid for a really horrible Samsung Flight II five years ago, this phone is immaculate.  In fact, I would have loved to have this phone 1 1/2 years ago when I decided to get MY first smartphone (Nokia Windows phone).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KWZWHQRAAU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XIHS62#wasThisHelpful","R25KWZWHQRAAU0","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been around perfumes, etc. a lot in my life, but this has a truly expensive essence.  It is powerful enough so that you can apply it very sparingly and it lasts a long time.  I can imagine it could be over-applied, but that would be sad.  Just a tiny dab here and there and you're going to be noticed close up, but not from a distance.

" 4:05 MinsMost ""telling"" moment:  After I'd set up this phone with MY sim card, I showed it to my wife.  Her first words were:  ""Wow Nice!  It's Mine!""Preliminary remarks:  There are already a dozen or so YouTube ""unboxing"" videos online and I am attaching the one by CLE Tech.  As always, most of the other reviews are idiotic, done by nobodies who made up an official-sounding name in order to get early deliveries of new Android products and did not bother to even read the specs and notes on the bluproducts site.  One ""commentator"" continually made a fool of himself saying ""I guess"" this and that and failed to know the box contained a quick charge system.  CLE Tech reads the promotional info and gives you the facts quickly, accurately and with their camera focused.If this is your FIRST Blu Phone, please do not overlook a special section at the end of this review that I've written especially for you.REVIEW:Upon Receipt, I opened the box and saw that all of the normal Blu accessories were there INCLUDING the soft case and the screen saver, earbuds, QUICK-charger, cables, etc.  Turned it on and saw the first change from previous Blu phones I've seen... BRIGHT amoled screen.  So they've learned that the YouTube reviewers base their review on that first impression.  I looked around for the normal Blu sim card drawer and it was not there, then saw the notch for prying off the back, which to me is a good thing.  Other models I've had used a dainty drawer that held the sim card and I'd rather just pry off the back, since I have a hard time finding the little key and also worry I might damage or lose the drawer itself.  This back has MANY snaps on it and is held very securely, so many in fact, that it's hard to get them all snapped when replacing the back.Sim card in, back replaced (I didn't have an available SD card to try yet) ... turned it on and it went into loading all of my apps from my Blu Vivo Air.  It pulled them all in, and added them to the stock apps that are included with the phone, many of which I will never use and probably delete, but it's nice to see what they are wanting me to use.  It did not turn on my Google Now Launcher, so I had to make that change myself, but the launcher had been downloaded into the apps available.  I like to at least start off with the Google Now Launcher since everything is right where I expect it to be and it also loads my custom wallpaper.One thing missing from this download was my phone contacts.  Instead it came up with a contacts list from the ancient past, and I'll have to look into that... IF I plan to keep the phone, against the wife's wishes.INSTANT LIKE:  Very strong signal!  The phone sensitivity is very good!  I get strong signal throughout the house, which is MAJOR since we are rural and 12 miles from the cell tower.  ALL of our other phones find the dead spots and have weak signals anywhere inside, mainly to do with the metal roof on the house and screened porches, probably.The extra RAM included (1.5GB total) keeps this unit responding at a snappy rate.  I had no problems with my apps today.This phone is a little heavier than my Vivo Air, thicker too..obviously because it has double the battery.  You'll see it when you take off the back... it is HUGE!Calls are clear over the phone speaker, music is loud and clear over the back speaker.  I have not yet used the earbuds.I should note that the phone came at 50% charge, I used it for hours without charging and it still showed about 50% when I put it on the charger.  I did not time the charge, but it was full when I looked 3 hours later.  There is a LOT of battery here.This was just my first impressions... MUCH MORE INFO TO COME.  My reviews always start small and growwwww until they become books, so check back for tips and likes and issues.Update Day two:  We took our first snapshots and selfies this morning and the selfies are very clear and crisp.  The rear camera is still a little suboptimal, but will do quite well for 90% of your pics.  It will not compare well against the big name Samsung, but for less than half the price, it does better for the money spent. It has the same specs as the Blu Vivo Air, but as a point-and-shoot it did a lot better without special settings.  I would not reject this phone on the basis of the cameras.If this is going to be your first BLU phone, here's some info about Blu Phones in general just to help you understand their concept.BLU (Bold Like Us) is an American company based in Florida, and they sell Chinese-made phones rebranded to their product name.  The phones are sold in other countries under other brand names.They are sold UNLOCKED, which means they work without needing a contract, and should work with any GSM SIM card such as ATT and the likes.  They do not work with Verizon or Sprint.If you are using the Blu to replace another GSM phone, all you need to do is open the back and slip the SIM card into the Blu and then let the software set you up (follow the instructions)Blu phones, as a rule, are well designed and fast, but with cameras not quite on the same level with Samsung and Apple.  They are generally sold at half the price of the big name phones or less and do not have replaceable batteries.

"Bottom Line First:Simple and convenient to use and store.  Heavier than most 16"" electrics, but has adequate power and speed for most quick jobs.Background:I live on a multi-acre rural place in SW Texas.  We get self-seeding cedar and hackberries and chinaberries that pop up in places where we can't easily mow them and they grow quickly.  Using loppers when they are small is the preferred way to deal with them, but sometimes they manage to grow unobserved until they start towering over preferred shrubs, so a chainsaw is required.  I have several gas chainsaws... have not had an electric until now that I've thought was adequate or that lasted long enough to earn its worth.  This is actually the first electric I've had any hope for, but still has obvious limitations.Review:Somehow, over the years, I've gotten old.  I enjoy working on my place, but tougher jobs tend to fall into procrastination which results in me getting exhausted.  Removing small unwanted trees and trimming the big oaks and pecans fall into this category.  I have some good gas saws, but sometimes just getting them started and keeping them running while I cut many trees or limbs just absolutely kills me.  An electric would be a great help since you just pull the trigger and go, but there are complications.  Many of the trees are beyond extension cord range.  Battery chainsaws are not worth spit.  So it's all a tradeoff.I bought a few corded electric saws years ago but was never happy with any of them.  They mostly had poor chain blades that dulled quickly, were only adjustable with screwdrivers or allen keys or nuts and bolts.  By the time I ran an extension cord and got started, once I found that the job was too much for a weak, dull electric, my patience wasn't good enough to make me walk back to the shed and gas up a powerful saw, so I'd just burn the poor little electric out by forcing it to do more than it was designed for.This Black & Decker CS1216 (so far) seems to have a moderately good quality chain and power enough to do trees and limbs up to about 3-5"" diameter just almost as well as the gas saws (only slower), without wearing myself out pulling the cord to restart each time I had to put it down and the idle died.  Within the 100 foot range of my extension cords, it will be a quick and easy way to do the work required without all the bother.  NOTE:  If you have experience with quality gas-powered chainsaws, you will not say this one ""cuts like butter"" because it is slow enough to actually feel the links of the chain hitting the tree.  It has a 16"" bar, so ""theoretically"" it can cut something nearly that much diameter... but you'd better bring your lunch because it's just that slow.  Also it doesn't take much of a pinch to slow or stall the motor.Adjusting chain tension (required several times during break-in) is very simple but does not ""look"" like it will be trouble free in the future... I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now, but will come back here and update if there is a problem.  In all honesty, though, I've never found any chain saw that I thought had a good chain adjusting system over time, but some were better than others.  This one is just a little feeble looking and feeling.This item will be fine for most homeowners needs without needing a big gas chainsaw, but please LET ME WARN YOU that if you have never used a chainsaw, ALL chainsaws are VERY DANGEROUS.  At very least, watch some of the training videos on YouTube and please use your head, especially when you are exhausted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZGFJDQUJ3QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ3FBOY#wasThisHelpful","R2OZGFJDQUJ3QP","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had hard and soft cases before, some even well thought out, but they were not as nice as this one.  In fact, I think this bag was designed by someone exactly like me... seems to be a custom design I would have drawn up myself.It's well-padded, all but the bottom side of the laptop compartment (but that's where the zipper slot is located for paperwork, which would add some protection) and the material is VERY well sewn and rugged.  There is even padding between the slot for the laptop and the slot for the tablet.  There is a large zipped section for manuals or paper materials, accessory pouches and of course the bottle holders at the ends, which are tight, but probably should be.Smoothly lined with bright material that allows things to slide in and out easily, and the bright color of the lining makes it easy to see inside to find things.Comparing to my other bags/cases, this one is just so convenient and simple to use.  With a hard case you have to find something to lay it on before you open it so you can get this or that out... this bag you just unzip the top, of course, (opens wide like a doctor's bag) and slide out the laptop or the tab (carries both at the same time) or your paperwork or accessories... or your bottle of water or pop.  It can be standing exactly like the picture, on the floor, on a table, in your lap... so convenient.This will be a perfect carrier for our HP laptop and Samsung 10-inch Tab 3.  We fly a lot and this will be part of our carry-on gear.  WELL worth the few extra bucks in price.  Rugged and protective while being very smart in appearance.Highly Recommended for business travel or simple commuting.

"Due to other meds that I take, I am having difficulty optimizing the effects of this supplement.  I need to publish my Vine review, so IN HOPES THAT I CAN HELP SOMEONE WITH SIMILAR ISSUES, I will put this up as a âwork in progressâ.Results to date:1.  Disclaimer:  I already take Huperzine A and Vinposetine for improved memory and mental acuity and tenacity.  These have been working well for me for two years, but over the past couple of months seem to be weakening in effect, thus this attempt at boosting myself back to optimum.  I have a fairly high IQ but due to my advanced age, seem to be losing my edge without chemical help.2.  After only two days of taking two PS-PA capsules, my mental abilities returned with a vengence.  I test my ability to think by playing Spider Solitaire at TOP difficulty.  Without medication, I find myself not caring much if I win or lose and plod along using the suggested actions.  With full doses of my HupeA, Vinposetine and PS-PA, I win ""almost"" every game easily (I do have a ""system"" that helps, ask in comments if you want to know about it).3.  The caveat with adding the PS-PA on top of my original nootropics was HIGH stress.  After only two days I was jumpy and nervous, even though Jarrow's claim was for less stress... can't blame Jarrow though, I took them on top of other meds!sooooo...4.  I stopped my Vinposetine and Huperzine A and for a week took only the PS-PA.  To my extreme disappointment, I slipped quickly into brainfog.5.  So I added the Vinposetine back, still not taking the HupeA, which had been my main helper for past years.  At the full dose of 3 PS-PA caps per day plus the 10mg Vinny... stress returned!6.  I decided all of this was not worth the trouble and went back to my original Huperzine A (increasing daily dosage from 200mcg to 300 a day) and the 10mg Vinposetine.  I'm already feeling sharper than before I tried the PS-PA and no stress, but not as sharp as when I was taking all 3 meds.  For this reason I will continue working on the mix, but I will not update unless I find a positive change.  Sorry Jarrow.Yes I know that the PS-PA is not supposed to show full results on its own until up to 30 days, but I have many things to do that require my brain to be working, so I can't sit around being stupid when I know I have meds that actually work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XBDILINN416C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFOR9AK#wasThisHelpful","R2XBDILINN416C","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bigger than expected and MUCH nicer.  We've bought quite a few ""gold plated silver"" items before, many from Amazon, with varying results.  This is probably the only one that has achieved the 5-Star rating.  The picture shown does not and cannot tell you what you're getting, because you just naturally expect it to be small and dull, like the pic.  Actually it's pretty good size and the chain is connected up high (as shown), so it hangs low for an 18"" chain.  The gemstones are a lovely color and would do well over a black blouse or top... But the main surprise is the way they've done the plating allows the silver to show through on the peaks of the wire, giving it the flash of diamonds.  There are no diamonds and I guess that's why they've chosen this picture so that you don't expect it, but in a lighted room, there are sparkles all over the front of the pendant.  My wife opened the box and started with the wows and giggles... she absolutely loved it!Just our own experience justifies our warning not to wear gold plated silver where it makes close contact with the skin as it sometimes results in tarnishing when  the plating wears thin... may not happen to you or to this item, time will tell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X74NMZJ0NZLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCK2XRE#wasThisHelpful","R2X74NMZJ0NZLH","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before voting this ""unhelpful"" please understand that Vine only allows me 30 days to review a product, which would be impossible with grass seed, of course.so.....I have pre-rated this item midway simply because it would be a waste of time for me to go to all of the prep work and watering in late September.  I will, however, plant a very small container of about 4 square feet to estimate a germination percentage and post that in about a month.  In late March I will do the full planting, provided my sample yields something worthwhile.  I am in SW Texas and April is the normal time to plant grass.I previously bought a bag of Scotts coated Bermuda grass and had fair luck with it (with persistent work on bare spots to make it even).  I don't blame the product as much as unusually hard rains this past spring that washed patches into puddles resulting in bare spots and overseeded areas.UPDATE 10/13/15:  I have added one star to the rating because I have planted my sample and have great germination.  The weather here has been fairly hot in the afternoons (85-93º) and moderate at night (70ish).  I've watered daily with a gentle sprinkle saturation.  I'm very pleased and will spread a yard or two of fresh loam in the spring and seed the entire bag.

"UPDATE @ 2 Months:  This was bought for the wife's ZF2 and she loves it.  Likes the way it works and the many things that show in the window when the phone is off... caller info, alarm clock, etc.  It does absorb some of the vibration, but still noticeable if you are set to vibrate only.  Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, you can take pics and adjust volume with the front cover full open and folded to the back. I have seen my fumble-fingers wife drop the phone MANY times with no damage to the case or the phone... so buy with confidence.Original Review:Dropped one star simply because I feel like the front cover could have been a little nicer.  It reminds me of a plastic child's wallet.  Naturally, as more people begin to discover the good things about this, they'll begin to improve the looks of the front with designs or whatever.  Some of the smart window cases for the iPhone 6 and the newer Galaxy models are pretty stunning.Other than that, so far, I'm very impressed with it.  Even with the somewhat floppy front cover it is very attractive and protects the front and back from scratches and dirt.  In the event of a drop, you're not likely to do much screen damage because it covers it of course, all but the circular cutout.  In fact, this is actually the most effective overall protection I've had on a phone case, since it covers the front and the back and gives a LOT more to grip onto both while putting it away AND when using it.  When I'm just selecting items or browsing, my thumb slips through the cover hole to make dropping almost impossible.  During texting or gaming in landscape position, I put the cover downward and it gives me a more comfortable grip while typing with my thumbs.  When the cover is closed the whole thing is much easier to handle because it is not slippery like any of the other cases I've had... though yeah there are a lot of cases I've never tried of course, but this one does more to protect than you would expect.  When you do put the phone to your ear, you can fold the cover to the back and it's out of the way.First of all, it's very simple to put this on and off... it simply snaps right over the back cover of the phone, leaving a big section open at the top and bottom, so that there are no problems plugging things in and out.  Fairly easy to remove as well, simply popping it out of the back shell... so for those of you worried about heating during long charges (common for the ZF2) can easily pop the cover off to prevent excess heat.Of course the round hole in the front is cool, with a ""smart window"" on the front flap that shows who's calling you, wakes the phone when you open the flap, puts it to sleep when you close it.  No button pushing or double tapping.  Also I've found it's very comfortable to use the open cover and window to get a great grasp on the phone while you're using it.  With your thumb through the hole it's not going to slip out of your hand and it's a comfortable way to hold the phone... great idea!Worth the 8 to 10 bucks even if it doesn't last long, which might be the case because the seam that holds it together looks like a glue-on situation.  I'm not going to tug on it to see how strong it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R99CNS2D701MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HHKZKM#wasThisHelpful","R99CNS2D701MW","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS:On the day I got this I was making so many errors, I thought maybe I would not adjust.  But after a few days my fingers woke up and quit thinking the keys were where they used to be.  I did several exercises with ""Now is the time for all good men..."" and now I have nothing but good things to say about actually typing on it.First of all, with the strange layout and split board, along with the BIG bumps  on the F and J keys... my hands fall right onto the home position... I mean immediately.  There's no hunting around to make sure I'm on the right keys, I start typing FAST and continue without effort.  I already would not trade this for my old Logitechs... I'd still like to have the extra video controls and audio player controls, but typing is the big thing for me.  I programmed the F keys to bring up GOM Player and  WinAmp and a few other things and I can control those from the keyboard easily now.  You guys complaining on the first day, don't send it back, just do a little ""typing class"" practice and you'll never look back.  Very speedy.---------------------This is a cursory review the first day after arrival, and I would normally wait a few weeks to talk about this sort of item ... but I will add more as I get more confident using it or if there are issues.1.  Arrives with only the keyboard and a tiny fold-out pamphlet that does NOT give any instructions, instead only warnings and warranty/repair info.  One statement I should quote among the warnings says: ""Long-term repetitive use of any keyboard could cause injury to user.  Perixx recommends users avoid excessive use of this or any keyboard.""2.  After installation, I immediately tested every key for defects, all work fine, require very little pressure, make the normal keyboard sounds (louder than my Logitech K740s and quieter than any of my cheap keyboards that came with various desktops I've bought over the years.3.  I slouch a lot while typing and the humped up center puts the keys at an angle that is a little more difficult to read the printing.  This is my first ergo keyboard so I can't compare it to the Microsoft 4000 or any of the more expensive models.  I am a touch typist and fairly fast, but initial use, OF COURSE is confusing because the keys are in slightly different locations and the numbers and backspace keys are not as easily within finger reach with my wrists on the rest.  Most troublesome to me today has been the backspace key, which I have had to use often while becoming accustomed to things... I get a \ from where my normal backspace position would be... I will acclimate.4.  Due to the repositioning of the keys, this is especially frustrating to use for a non-touch typist, especially due to the key labels being at such a slant away from the typist.  For me, that might be a good thing, since it will keep my wife away more... she tends to change settings and I don't like her to use my computer... heck she has two computers of her own... no need to use mine anyway!5.  The quick keys at the top are set to give quick internet access, email, search, volume and mute and a quick sleep key.  Since I don't use the same browser and email Perixx uses, I'll have to figure out a way to reprogram a couple of them.  I use WinAmp for music, and I'm well accustomed to using the home cluster of keys to operate that, just a little rusty at it since I've been using Logitech K740s for the past 5 years or so, but it's coming back to me.Note:  After about 4 or 5 hours of speed typing today to get used to the new positioning, I am still making some mistakes (I've been using standard keyboard positioning for 50+ years) but getting better at it.  My wrists are SORE and that worries me, but hopefully it's mainly due to a lot of tension rather than the new angles.  I do like the keyboard and I will add many notes below this as I use it.  Updates about issues will be at the top of the review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQV0SJVY0ZZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076KUTKS#wasThisHelpful","R2CQV0SJVY0ZZJ","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has Filipina straight black hair to her butt which I love very much, but suddenly got the notion she wanted to color it blonde.  I would hate for her to do that, especially since it would take years for it to look natural again, so I suggested we buy this wig so she can see how she would look.  I think I won that skirmish, but it's no reflection on the wig itself.  It does look very synthetic and she says drops hair, but for the price, it's certainly what it was intended to be... a cosplay wig.  It's cute and would be fun for play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7TCY4DDPB9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3BLU2Q#wasThisHelpful","RE7TCY4DDPB9F","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quick review here to make it clear that there are indeed 6 bottles and 6 colored lids... pic made that unclear.  Good quality and low price.  Only possible critical point would be that the stoppers are hard to get on the first time.  These will be useful for my e-liquid home lab since the tops are easier to remove instead of re-using the pop-off spouts on old e-juice bottles.UPDATE:  These bottles seal very well with no leakage at all.  I would suggest widening the metal needle to allow the thicker mixtures, especially the pure VG to flow through better, it requires a hard squeeze to slowly fill the clearomizer tanks.  Great product none the less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M05IIRLNR5QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8ZMMSI#wasThisHelpful","R1M05IIRLNR5QG","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A welcome replacement for my second Logitech K740 that kept popping off keys.  I miss the mute/volume keys and the audio player controls, but simply having a full set of keys and no nubs to have to press where keys used to be is a blessing.  This is a simple keyboard but even if it only lasts a few weeks I will be happy.  Buying it on Prime and using bonus points made it virtually free anyway, so I have nothing to complain about.UPDATE after a week of heavy use:  I find this keyboard comfortable to use and allows fast typing once again (missing key caps on my old keyboard was very frustrating to someone who types fast in a creative mode, so it is a freedom that I'd been missing).I do find that a few functions are different or altered on this keyboard, however, on specialized applications... for instance, on my GOM player I can no longer use the control (numberpad) functions the way they should be, which is frustrating.  Because of that and the lack of audio function keys, I've decided to buy another keyboard for everyday use and save this one for emergency situations.  I'm not complaining about it though, because the price was so good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYHQG35QDT6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ELVLKU#wasThisHelpful","R1YYHQG35QDT6Q","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update after a month's use:I like these buds the best of any I've had other than the ones that came with my BLU phone (best sound quality of any earbuds I've ever had).  The thing I like BEST is that they are so easy to place in my ears, there's no screwing them into the ear hole or twisting them this way or that to get the best sound.  They just fall right into place and stay there... comfortably.  These do NOT have a huge bass boost built in, they are fairly a flat response, so that you do the ""coloring"" with your software.  I can easily wear these the entire time I'm watching two football games (6 hours) without discomfort, and each time I get up to get more snacks, it's just a simple light tug on the cord to remove them.  They are well worth the price.

"This item does exactly what it is intended to do, provided the door and its trim are even with each other.  If they are not, you may have to add a piece of wood under one side or the other to make them even.  Bear in mind, however, that devices like this only make the door so it can't be opened ""easily"".  If the person on the other side is so determined to get in that they don't worry about the noise, they can smash through the door or break a window to get in.  Ours is just on a hollow core door that goes to an insecure utility room, so it would be very easy to smash through even if the screws on the door hold perfectly... that kind of door is pretty much made of cardboard.  Our thinking is that nobody could come in without making enough noise to warn us... bang!For the person who wants to put this on a front door so you can open it just a crack, kind of like the ""chain latches"", it will work fine and cannot be unlatched from the outside, but yes, just the same as with the chain, if the guy out there is going to blast through with his shoulder, the strength of the door itself and the screws holding the latch on the door and trim come into play... most screws will give way pretty easily to a solid shoulder smash to the door.  You can make it a little more secure by substituting stronger, longer screws that go through the trim and into the door jamb, and nuts and bolts that go all the way through the door, but for normal situations where you're making sure it's the pizza guy at the door, the included screws will work fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG4L9D74UMRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQWICQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BG4L9D74UMRL","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since going to the ""Spinner"" type of battery, I've needed to go back to the old type of eGo charger rather than USB.  I only had one left and it was going slowly, it seemed... I've owned probably a dozen total, some cheap, some more expensive.  This particular charger, which I assume is Chinese-made, charged my 1600mw Spinner II in a matter of two hours, from totally dead to totally charged.  Compared to the old one, which I've always considered my best one, it's magnificent.  Highly recommended.If it continues to work well I will add another star, but if it slows as the others have done, or begins to become mechanically defective or get so it won't connect properly as some have done, I'll be back here to complain :)  As of this time I'm very pleased indeed.UPDATE:  Though this charger is still working very well, my backup charger died and I think I'm finally seeing why.  I leave the chargers plugged in and powered up all the time.  Stupid me, I'm an electrical engineer and never even thought about screwing one battery out of the charger and replacing it with a discharged unit WHILE THE CHARGER IS POWERED UP.  Since the eGo batteries are circular at the connector and you have to kind of move them around to find the threads, you will inevitably cause a short at the charger connection.  I will now simply snap the USB out of the puck anytime I swap out batteries on the charger.  It's probably been that lazy bad habit that has killed most of them in the past.  I would love to have one that had a power switch on the puck to make that a little easier and safer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NF5751HPW9YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHC0OOM#wasThisHelpful","R3NF5751HPW9YG","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree that for the price, this is a good bargain, but I want you to know what you're getting here.I would NOT want this to protect a door, because it is all made of thin sheet stainless and it wouldn't withstand more than a shoulder push.  You can also see by looking at the pic there is NO place for you to put a padlock, so that claim is poppycock.BUT, if you want something convenient for the inside of a window, this is well worth the price.  It slides shut and clicks into place, holds firmly.  Press the button and it pops open with ease and stays full open until you manually slide it shut.  So this is perfect to mount on both sides of a window to make it secure from an outside lift.Also you would not want this for protecting a child from opening a cabinet door.  It might take the child a minute or two, but eventually it would find out how to press the button.I bought this simply to hold an attic door closed, not locked, because that silly door comes open by itself.  This will do that job just fine.  The advantage for my use is that if the door should close while I'm inside, the latch won't lock by itself, it has to be pushed into place purposely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR8G8WSWVF3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARBCSRK#wasThisHelpful","R3BR8G8WSWVF3P","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update Aug 23:  I've mostly solved the ""invisible button"" issue by asking my wife to paint the button with red nail polish.  It still allows the light to show through and makes it easier to find the button visually.--------------------------------------------------This will be a review of the Spinner II vs the original Spinner vs the eGo USB vs the eGo-C vs the eGo variable voltage wired pass-thru.I've been using eGo systems and accessories since their inception, so I can tell you about all there is to know, I guess.  I'd been using various drip systems when I found the eGo drip version, liked the long-lasting rechargeable 350mw battery that was so much more simple than removable batteries, so I've stuck with a simple system that worked well for many years.  Pretty much the only changes I've made were increasing battery capacity and going to the simple Innokin Clearomizer tank system.  It's a system that is fairly durable, makes enough vapor to satisfy me but not make a cloud that is so obvious that I'm easily detected in questionable zones.  But you only want to know about the batteries, particularly the Spinner II... and you guys that use baseball bat sized battery systems that you still have to drip into so you can make an explosion of vapor are not going to be interested in an eGo anyway... so here goes:The new Vision Spinner II differs from the original first of all that it is more powerful (1600mw vs 1200) and about a 5/8 of an inch longer, but since the switches are located at about the same place, I doubt there is ""actual"" battery located in the extra length.  It's a tiny bit heavier and about the same diameter... see attached pic.  At the 3.8 volt setting, both of my vision batteries make the same amount of vapor as does the USB battery.  I use 3.8 volts because the higher settings tend to make me go through atomizers and liquid faster as well as charring the liquid and making it taste bad after a tank or two.Other points for the new Spinner version are a detented control that has a slotted bottom that I guess is intended for a coin in case you don't have a strong grip.  The old version turned more easily and just had a narrow grip that turned way too easily and often got reset accidentally.  Also the place at the top where you used to be able to screw on a ""beauty ring"" is gone, which allows the overall length to be less... you can see from the pic that the black battery portion is about an inch longer in the new unit, but overall length is only a half inch or so longer.My single complaint would be the button, which is only to be found by looking for it... you can't find it by touch like on the old one, but that's fine with me.  Other guys have complained here about the top breaking loose when they carry the unit in their jeans pocket, and that's a design flaw in the original and all other eGo batteries.  Don't put them in your jeans pocket.  I usually just keep mine in my hand since I constantly puff, but if you go into a restricted zone you'll need to find a hiding place.  Pants with long, low pockets are good.I still have and use ALL of the battery systems listed on the top line of this review and tend to use the pass-thru more than any other, simply because I am a computer addict as well as e-vapor addict... so that's where I usually hang out.  I prefer this new Spinner II simply because it has a powerful, long lasting battery and allows me to be mobile for longer times.  Of course I have a 4amp charger in the car, so I don't often get caught with dead batteries anyway, but of all of the systems listed here, the USB's seem to last the shortest time before expiring forever.  I've broken many in jeans, and I've worn many out, but I'm not ready to go to a baseball bat sized battery either.I like this one and hope you will to.  I'll update if I have any problems to tell about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJ07TH1ZHIEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZJ2G46#wasThisHelpful","R2DJ07TH1ZHIEO","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm rating this 5 stars because the unit is as good as you could get for the money.  Granted, for more money you could have more expensive fittings, etc, but they are really not necessary unless you are going to be constantly moving and reassembling.This is my 3rd unit for the house one in downstairs kitchen and one upstairs as well, replacing a 12-year old system that's never caused a problem other than a leak in the UV two weeks ago.  Sure I could have replaced just the UV but hey it's time for a complete new system.Complaints about the clarity of the instructions are unfounded as far as I'm concerned.  I was replacing a similar unit (different brand) but there were no parts of the old system re-used other than the metal fitting on the cold water pipe, which still required the new compression fitting.  The only difficulty with the instructions was the slightly upgraded output faucet which was not covered, but easy to figure out the difference and install.The main caution, as said by a few others, is to make sure you seat the tubes fully into the fittings... it's covered well in the manual and on youtube, but I still managed to have one leak afterward, which was hectic since I already had the unit on the wall of the cabinet and it was now full of water and pretty heavy.  Push those tubes into the fitting HARD so you can feel when it goes that last 3/8 of an inch.PROs vs the older unit:1.  Very very nice that they pre-assembled the filter portion, that saves probably 45 minutes for you.2.  Tubing diagram, in color, makes assembly and troubleshooting very easy.3.  This unit has about twice the water volume coming out of the faucet, which is nice if you're filling a coffee pot.4.  Extra Filters includedCONs vs older unit:1.  Does not include the UV sanitizer, and they point out twice in the instructions that you need that if you have any chance of microbial pollution.  If you are using city water, it's probably not needed, but those of us in the country will need them.2.  Not one complaint about the purchased unit itself.  Good quality.I'm almost 75 years old and assembled this without help.  I'm blind in one eye, a little senile, and have problems crouching for any period of time and even worse trying to get back up from under the sink.  I'm sure it took me twice as long as most people, but the result was well worth it.  I like the color coded tubing, easy to see where things go and come from under the sink.Suggestions for easier assembly:1.  Install the faucet first, with the tubing left full length2.  Install the input line from the cold water pipe, leaving the tubing full length3.  Install the tank, tubing full length4.  Install the drain tube cut to the length since the junction with the sink drainpipe is near the front.5.  Place a large rectangular plastic dish pan in front of the cabinet and assemble the connections there, so that you can turn it on and check for leaks before hanging the unit on the cabinet wall.

Because I'm thinking many people bought them about the time I did and are now looking for a substitute, since the Cybersonic 3 is almost identical to the original model and reviews say it doesn't last long.  My Cybersonics lasted about 6 years each.Reasons the Sonicare is better:1.  Faster motion means more scrubs per minute2.  Smaller brush head fits easily in gaps where teeth are missing and gets deeper between normal teeth.3.  A little smaller and lighter4.  Metal spindle and interface between handle and brush.  The Cybersonic has a plastic interface that wears out quickly if you have a family snapping brushes and flossers in and out daily.Reasons the Cybersonic II was better:1,  Has a very, very good flossing system included... the best I've ever seen2.  Bigger, more stable charging base with places to store brush heads3.  Cheap replacement brushes (providing you didn't fall for the ""free brush"" scam where they sent you a new brush each month and charged 6 bucks for shipping) and flosser snap-ins.  Of course this cost depends on how often you replaced brushes and flossers.Other comments:1.  Cybersonic batteries kept charging fully for many years, I will let you know eventually how long the Sonicare batteries last.2.  I can see right away that the small, light charging base will fall over easily and possibly drop the unit off the countertop.  I'm thinking once I am sure where I want to keep the charging base, I'll put a dab of silicone caulk under it to hold it steady.3.  Don't get me wrong, I do like the Sonicare, it's speedy and really feels like it is getting my teeth cleaner, but I will still keep the remaining handle and floss heads of the Cybersonic until they die completely and then look for more on eBay.  That flosser is a thousand times better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AI95FXDX384M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M1BO3U#wasThisHelpful","R3AI95FXDX384M","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spent the extra bucks and expected the best... and got it!  Two day Prime delivery, received this afternoon and installed immediately (old cheapie was leaking, flooding the cabinet below).  Downloaded the installation manual yesterday and studied it, so all went very smoothly.  Moen takes the trouble to make installation of even a commercial product simple enough for a non-plumber.Heavyweight item, no slop in the spout rotation, smooth working valve and even the sprayer was a quick connect deal.  The only difficulty was in removing the horrible cheap faucet that was there before and had been leaking for some time apparently... hard work to break the bolts loose and get it out of there, but from then on it was easy peasy.  No leaks, no trouble at all other than the coiled plastic hose for the sprayer getting snarled until I realized running hot water through it would straighten it out.Well worth the extra dollars and then some... you won't regret this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NH2AFTB3KL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RYIVHA#wasThisHelpful","R8NH2AFTB3KL7","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is made by Enerlite, which is the same brand as the sensor/switch I was replacing.  The old one started giving problems after 3 months or so by intermittently not switching ON.  Sometimes it would just blink, but then you'd have to go to the switch (located at the kitchen sink) and manually slide it to ON.  But then of course you had to remember to turn it back to the center position in hopes it would work the next time.  I called Enerlites who simply told me they do not handle customer complaints and for me to contact the retailer.  Things gradually got worse until the unit would never switch on by itself.So the reason I ordered THIS switch was that I thought it was made by someone other than Enerlite... ah well.  If I have a problem I'll call Top Greener rather than Enerlite this time.As a precaution, this time I installed a double box (a little sawing required to expand the hole) and installed a manual switch next to the new sensor.  I did this because this particular Enerlite switch does not have the slide switch located on the outside like the last one did, you have to pop off the bottom cover (over the pushbutton OFF switch), so that would mean if this switch failed in the same way as the last one, I could not turn the lights on manually.  The manual switch I added simply bypasses the sensor and is easy to work and with a double plate there and the rocker switch, it looks very nice.Installation situation:  My kitchen was originally kind of dim, with a single light bulb over the sink and another over the kitchen table.  It meant that most of the long countertop had bad lighting and often a shadow so it was hard to see what you were doing.  I installed lights above each of the double doors of the upper cupboards so that they shined down from above your head, and also shined into the cupboards, making a WORLD of difference lighting the work area.  I simply connected the new lights to the old single sink light.  That sounds ugly and kind of stupid, but it was done very nicely and it actually makes the right amount of light for the area using 5 13watt CFL bulbs.  The sensor switch allows you to switch on the lights simply by approaching the work area and it is set to 5 minutes duration, just in case you are standing still too long.  Originally I had it set to less time, trying to ""save electricity"" but it would time out and be irritating if you had to stop what you were doing to wave at the sensor.  But with the 5 minute duration, you're pretty much certain to move enough to reset the timer and not have the lights turn off while you're still there.  I was very pleased with the original Enerlite switch until it started failing to turn on, and the new one is working fine as well, so far.  If this new one lasts more than two years, I'll be happy and give the rating a 5th star.  If it does not, it's cheap enough to just buy another.  With the parallel bypass switch, I don't foresee any problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZQY8ZW6VDWEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEZKFIW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZQY8ZW6VDWEG","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't used mouse pads since I got rid of my last ball-mouse 10 years or so ago, but I made a pull-out keyboard shelf for my desk, just to give me more legroom under the desk, and made the shelf out of white rough-surfaced shelving from Lowes.  The mouse was NOT happy with that surface causing skipping and difficulty doing fine movements.  I bought this pad simply because I want it to stay in place AND the fact that it is very thin rather than a big piece of plastic or a thick pad.  It excels amazingly for this function and causes me no discomfort at all, plus the mouse is functioning the best it ever has.  I'm very pleased with it, and it wipes clean easily.  Remains to be seen how it holds up to the wear of the mouse constantly moving over it (the surface of my desk where the mouse used to move is like polished glass compared to the rest of the desktop, so I know there is a good test for the pad for the next year or so.Nothing has peeled up around the edges and the stickum is holding...

"We bought this a few months ago hoping to use it as a special cloth when we want the table to look a little more snazzy.  It's a very special handmade inlay oak table that is easily damaged by moisture, so I have a solid plastic cover over it and a linen cloth over that for normal daily use.  I just today needed some snazziness, so put this on top of the black linen.  It does look nice at first glance, but the lace is very, very thin and actually looks very machine made.  A bigger complaint is that it is actually painful when you put your elbow on the table, kind of cutting into your skin!  I guess for twenty bucks you can't expect a really nice one, but hey, I had hopes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33P5R6Q3W3DZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARMG0LY#wasThisHelpful","R33P5R6Q3W3DZM","A2OR94VN7XQCUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OR94VN7XQCUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They sent me another unit and it works beautifully.  I appreciate their concern and good service.  This one plugs in solidly and seems very good quality.Sound quality is very good and this unit is much more rugged with the aluminum case than another brand we bought before that was just thin plastic and cracked open soon after purchase.  I'm sure this one will work for a long time.  My wife's laptop had no output from the headphone jack when purchased ""refurbished"", so we have to go this route, which is not a big expense.  I will be so happy not to have to suffer the bad audio from her laptop speaker ... it's been a long hard route, buying a usb speaker that wasn't very much better than the laptop speakers, then the fragile plastic usb sound adapter (not made by Sabrent).

"ITHe Bluetooth Headset S530 is a remarkable product.  However, I do believe that the next generation will be much better.Good Things:1. The fit in the RIGHT ear is exceptional.  It is comfortable and stays in place.  The instructions says that it is designed for the RIGHT EAR ONLY.  So the picture is misleading.2. The sound quality very good.3. It paired very easily with three different generation cell phones.  I suggest that you be a little patient with it and remember to hold for 4-5 seconds OR until the device light starts to flash red then blue.4. Music streaming is very good and the music can be paused by touching the multi-function button or when an incoming call arrives.5.  Two quick touches of the Multi-Function button and the last number dialed function is activated.  REMEMBER Two QUICK touches.  Two slow touches and the devices switches to Chinese language(Don't know why it is designed to do that.).6.  Device informs you when connected and disconnected.  Hopefully in a language that you can understand.Now for the NOT SO GOOD:1.  There is no voice commmand dialing function.  You must use your phone to initiate a call.  Inconvenient, but not a failing issue.2.  There is no volumn control on the device.  You must use phone to vary volumn or you can pause the music or incoming call--that is really Inconvenient.3.  There is NO audio track forward or back advancement function on the device. Again you must go to the sending device, the phone, to advance the music track.4.  The device drops and restores signals for no known reason. Music streaming sometimes will have intermittant failures, which can be irritating.(Remember you can not back up the streaming).5.  The device is designed so you can easily convert the language to Chinese.  There is no need for the two language system. If you should stumble into the Chinese, just push the MFB again and you will go back to English.NOTE: The instructions are difficult to understand because of ovbious language difference of the writer.  And a caution, the device is small and can be fragile.  I would recommend that you charge the device twice before using.  When charging the Red light will be on.  It goes off when device is ""charged"".  However it is a good idea to remove the charging cable and reconnecting it to facilitate a FULL charge.  So all things considered for a device that fits confortably IN YOUR EAR and provides clear music streaming and voice conversations, this product is a good purchase at the price.  Even with the short comings mentioned above, I would recommend it for those who do not require the more dynamic highly functional Bluetooth headset.  Hopefully the next version will have all the missing features mentioned above.  Hope that helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CEQ3GBSNPER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0ME68A#wasThisHelpful","R16CEQ3GBSNPER","AJGZH8VFWTTIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGZH8VFWTTIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Strange that many people have experienced the same problem with the Brother MFC-J870DW and I and others have experienced with the Brother MFC-J825DW, in that over time the quality of print starts to diminish.  Currently my Brother MFC-J825DW give very poor quality BLACK printing.  Cleaning the printer only seems to make the problem worst and CONTRARY to what you may have heard, probably from Brother, it does not seem to matter if you use Brother's more expensive cartridges or OEM cartridges.  In all cases the quality of the print goes from pretty good to very bad in a short period of time.  It would appear that the Brother MFC-800 series uses the same print head and that print head clogs or becomes defective after using for any period of time.  I have used other Ink-Jet printers and I have never had a gradual diminishing of print quality.  I have attempted to find out from the vender (the product seller) if there is some way to clean the print head and restore print quality, but the vendor had not responded to my requests.  My next attempt will be directly to Brother.  Perhaps there is some secret that is not disclosed to the consumers.  In any case based on the number of ""poor print quality"" reviews I have read, I am reluctant to purchase another Brother Ink-Jet product.  I have the highest reguard for Brother Laser printers, but my respect for their ink-jets is fading as fast as the printer's print quality. Hope that helps.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBJ9ZNILD3GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHJ8QLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JBJ9ZNILD3GW","AJGZH8VFWTTIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGZH8VFWTTIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: This is a very heavy cable.  I purchased it because it was the only DVI-I (24+5) that I could find that was Prime.  The cable will not fitproperly on the Dell monitor because of the thickness and rigidity of the cable.  I was able to test the cable's performance on a HDTV and it delivers a very good signal.  BUT, I could caution purchasing for use on a computer monitor because the cable is not flexible and the ferrites on the cable are very large, obstructive and heavy.  For monitors with cable loads on the side, this may be a great cable, however it would seem that the weight of the cable would excessively pull down against the monitor plug-in and MAY eventually cause harm to the monitor.  All cables have some degree of pull on the plug-in, but this cable is much heavier then any cable I have ever dealt with.  In summary, this cable is difficult to work with because of thickness and rigidity.  The signal that the cable delivers is not any better then thinner cables supplied by other vendors.

"The sprayed on leather-look material first cracks, then it starts to peel off and becomes a real problem.  I asked furnature repair experts and there is NO way of preventing this product from cracking, peeling and falling off.  It seems deceptive that the seller would use the word LEATHER in the title and description when there is no leather on this product.  This is not bonded leather, which is thin leather bonded to fabric.  The covering is made of chemicals, most likely, sprayed onto a fabric that is not conducive to the process.  Secondly the mechanism that supports the chair is proned to comming loose and if you do not keep an ear open for the tell-tale sounds of metal snapping, you run the risk of the chair frame breaking.  That's right, you should take a wrench and from time to time tighten up the bolts, but not too tight.  It is unfortunate that one can not replace the phony L-look padded area, but then again there is the issue of the frame that becomes unstable if not frequently attended to.  That being said, IF and only IF you are looking for a moderately comfortable chair to use for a short period of time, say a year or less, this is a good product to have.  BUT beyony that time and the product starts to deteriorate.  Also, keep in mind that the safe weight for use of this chair is 250 lbs or LESS.  This is not a good product, but it does have its uses.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7N83JKKCCXQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00363XK2I#wasThisHelpful","R7N83JKKCCXQT","AJGZH8VFWTTIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGZH8VFWTTIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rockwell RK3440K VersaCut Circular SawThe Rockwell RK3440K VersaCut Circular Saw is actually a Circular Saw. It is NOT a hand held cutting tool for several reasons.1. The blade is covered by far too much material and makes it very difficult to line up a ""plunge"" cut. You simply can not see the blade unless you put your face close to the material to be cut, which is never safe.2. Because of the non-varying blade speed, when hitting the different densities in wood, the VersaCut tends to kick back or jerk , which will radically alter the cutting pattern and in some cases create a do over situation. Also, the Rockwell RK3440K will kick back when cutting thin sheet metal, which may have been cause by blade wabble, but it was a real surprise as I struggled to maintain control of the cutting device.3. Changing blades is a chore because it requires you to handle two Allen wrenches, one to prevent the cutting blade from turning, and the second to loosen the blade. Then there is the problem of the blade shield being in the way. You have to pull the release trigger, which is very near the power button, then push the shield out of the way to get the small cutting blade off and on. (you should unplug the VersaCut before attempting to change the blade).4. There is a safety issues with the Rockwell RK3440K VersaCut Circular Saw, in the location of the power trigger. It is difficult to get your finger off the device when it is moving because the trigger is located so far forward on the grip.5. The thickness of the grip makes it difficult to control the device.6. The laser is a nice feature, but it is pointless when the saw dust covers the cut line. All the laser does is makes the dust easier to see.It would appear that Rockwell, an exceptional company, simply reduced the 7 1/4 circular saw, keeping all the problems that made a new product desirable, and miniaturized the circular saw.All that being said and considered, is this a BAD product? I would say NO, BUT I would not recommend this product for novice, journeymen (persons), generalist, or those who are new to the construction and home repair efforts. If I had the time, I would keep the Versa Cut and practice, practice practice, until I learned all its quirks, But I do not have the time. The Rockwell RK3440K VersaCut Circular Saw is a fairly good product for professional users, but it should be greatly improved for the average less experienced user. Hope that helps.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFFO35H3AMTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052EK78O#wasThisHelpful","R1MFFO35H3AMTO","AJGZH8VFWTTIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGZH8VFWTTIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Back2Life Continuous Motion Massager does not do what I expected it to do.  My lower back was injured many years ago in Viet Nam and occasionally it will shift and cause pain.  I have had massages and chiropratic treatment that does a short term relief.  I was tired of making the trip to the ""store to get the fix.""  The machine looks SILLY, so I ordered the model that was advertised as coming with an instructional DVD to fully demonstrate how it works.  What I received was a unit that had NO DVD, but a set of 5 pound leg weights.  I wondered what would be the purpose of wearing leg weights while using a machine that GENTLY lifts you.  Was the weights designed to make it more difficult for the machine to work properly?  Perhaps the DVD would have explained, but there was no instructional DVD. I contacted the vendor TWICE and got no response.Now about the Massager:  I am 6'1"" so I set the machine to 6'4"" tried it AND NOTHING.  I lay there on the floor for 12 minites and wondered what I was doing wrong because the machine did not LIFT any portion of my body off the floor.  So I set it to 6'6"" and again notihing, but this time the machine would cut itself off and I had to wiggle to get it to come back on.  My wife who has nearly constant low level back pains, is 5'2"", she tried it and what she got was a numbness in her legs and feet, but no relief of her back pain.But I kept the faith and tried again.  I noticed that the height of the lift at 6'4"" is the exact same as 6'6"".  I decided to do an experiment.  I lay on the floor with my legs on the end of the bed and my head on a comfortable pillow for 12 minutes, and the results were the EXACT same as with the Back2Life Continuous Motion Massager.  I felt a very slight relaxation in the S-region of the lower spine, but nothing as wonderful as promised by the glowing reviews.  Perhaps, there is a secret on the instructional DVD that greatly contributes to the wonder of the machine, but remember, I did not get the promised DVD.Maybe, just maybe I received a model with a ""lazy"" motor that refused to actually lift your lower back off the floor, don't know.  What I do know is that the end of bed experiment achieves the same results as this machine and the bed is free.

"I don't understand the rave reviews for this product because I have not found it to live up to advertisement.  For one thing there are multiple versions of the OrGrennic pans avaialable.  The ones with the silver rim around the pans are .4 mil thicker then the pans without the silver rims.  The thicker pans tend to hold up better.  I happen to have both types of pan.  In any case after a very few uses on a ceramic or glass top cook surface the fry pans will develop ""Sticking Points"".  This will happen regardless of the amount of oil that is used in the fry pan or the lowering of the tempature of the cook surface.  I have returned three pans to a local BB&B store and got clear instructions as to how to preserve the ""NON-STICK PROMISE"" on the replacements.  None of the suggestions have worked.  Also the pans tend to warp and will not sit flush on a flat cooking surface. The center point of the pan, where the OrGreenic label is stamped pushes down making the pan have uneven cooking areas.  Solution: Very Gently, tap of the bottom of the pan at the OrGreenic Label will correct the problem but only for a short period of time. Also, after using the fry pans for a very short period of time, if you clean the pan, as directed, and hold the pan in sunlight, you can see the dull discolored ""Sticking Points"".  SO, I am still searching for a TRUELY NON-STICK fry pan and unfortunately I have found that the OrGreenic pans are not that.

"The Cozy-Heater 250 Watt Wall Mounted Electric Panel Heater smells like a buring electrical product.  The photograph shows an item that APPEARS to be 24'W x 18""H x 2""D, BUT the actual product is 18""W x 24'H x 2""D, which makes a differece in where the item can be mounted.  The item arrived in a box that pictured an eligent looking heater that had a front switch on the upper right hand corner, which is the heater that I ordered. What I arrived in the box does not match the picture on the website no the box.  Also, the panel heater arrives covered in white dust of an unknown nature. The toxicity level of which is totally unknown. The heater has to be cleaned off before initial use.  Further, the ""NEW"" heater design requires that the electrical wire remain in close contact with the heated surface, which should be considered a serious safety hazard.  After much email, discussion, and confusion, I returned the product and was very glad to be rid of the odor, yes the product continues to smell when it is not in use.  Regarding the effectiveness of the product, it does not appear to function as a ""CONVECTION"" heater.  If you place an opened tissue at the top of the product, there is NO AIR MOVEMENT, therefore the hype that it is a CONVECTION heater that draws cool air in at the bottom, heats that air and disburses warm air is simply not true, the air movement is to minimal to be considered a CONVECTION heating system.  I gave this product one star, but it truly deserves less.  There exists a very slim possibility that I received a defective product, but accepting that indicates that there are other ones in the sales distribution system.  I would avoid this product.

"The first thing I want to mention is that this book should not necessarily be taken as a parenting how-to book. Unless the advice really fits your personal parenting values. However, this book is a necessity for all parents who just need a good laugh - and that's all parents. When you're a parent, you need to take a break from all the work, worries and stress that parenting entails. Then read this book, laugh out loud, and wish you could do and say all the things that Elizabeth recommends in her book. It's written with advice and personal anecdotes from her childhood that she believes are useful tools to raise happy and healthy children.Don't let the idea of guilt and manipulation scare you away from this book. Yes, it's full of guilt and manipulation tactics that I admit I've thought about but have never used. Now I feel embolden with the knowledge that these tactics can work. I've encountered many of the parents and their children that Elizabeth writes about in her book, especially the playground bully and moms who sexualize their daughters by dressing them like party girls. Admit it, we've all seen this.The author sometimes spends a little too long on her personal experiences growing up in Las Vegas but I'm sure it was to add pages to the book, and very specific examples of how her parents style of raising their kids makes the case for guilt and manipulation to work. Her experiences in growing up in Las Vegas were often different than my Midwestern upbringing, but I enjoyed her advice just the same. I didn't just enjoy it - I laughed hard at many of her anecdotes and observations. Okay, I'm not really going to work at raising my kids this way but sometimes wish I had the courage, or had Tony the Ant on speed dial.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Q5ZV1FGHT2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061759570#wasThisHelpful","R21Q5ZV1FGHT2Q","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried other natural and organic mists to help relieve sinus infections but none have helped as much as this mist. I get several sinus infections due to severe allergies and neither I nor my doctor want me to take antibiotics that often, so I've tried to find a natural treatment to help out. I decided on this mist because of so many positive reviews and I'm so glad that I did. It has helped so much that I didn't use any medication during my last infection.

"I have very sensitive skin and don't use peels or masks because they tend to make my skin sting and turn red - even the natural and organic peels. I have to say that this peel is no exception. The first time I used it my skin felt like it was burning. But that was for the first two or three minutes and then the burning stopped. Now even a couple of minutes is a lot of time when your face hurts. After I rinsed off the mask, I will admit that my skin looked good. It was smooth with a refreshed look - brighter might be the best word to describe it. But my skin was not red. I waited a week and tried the peel again. I experienced the burning again but for a much shorter period of time, and again my skin looked really good afterward. I have a feeling that there is a cumulative benefit for the skin when using a pumpkin peel. So I tried it a third time and noticed very little stinging (not really burning now), but still have nice looking and smoother skin. I use the peel only once a week just to be cautious, which will make it last for me. Since I have experienced good results and reduced burning I gave it four stars and have to say that I do like. This may be the only pumpkin peel that I can actually use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLGYY5MD0ITHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BLZ4MY#wasThisHelpful","RLGYY5MD0ITHJ","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I began using Gallery Leather planners many years ago but after we moved I couldn't find a local store that sold them. I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon. I like to use both my calendar app. on my smart phone and a traditional planner, mostly because I can write faster than I type. I use my app for reminders and alerts. What I like about this particular planner is it's good looks, clean and easy to use daily pages, and lined pages each week for lists and ideas. The company still includes pages for personal/birthday information, extra note pages and several maps, which occasionally come in handy. I especially like the fact that it's slim and flexible so that it fits in my tote or handbag, and the company keeps making them in the same colors so that I have an elegant row of tan planners on my shelf.

"These are the best laundry bags available. I've tried so many other bags and a consistent problem is the zipper pull breaking away from the zipper. This makes the bag troublesome to open and close, but also leaves a sharp edge that can mar or cut other garments that are also in the washer. I will try to wash a few delicates at the same time but they don't all need to be protected in a bag. I found some items damaged and think that it must be the zippers on the bags. The Laundress' bags have a flap that folds over the zipper thus eliminating any rubbing of the zipper on other clothes. And should the pull break away the flap covers it.

"I wanted to use this oil for a while before I gave it a fair review. I purchased the Prickly Pear Seed Oil because I read in a few sources that it is highly beneficial to skin as an anti-aging moisturizer. There are a few new skin care products that include this oil and most of these are quite expensive. I do have very sensitive skin but no serious aging issues - yet, and I didn't not want to spend much money for a moisturizing oil. I did a bit of research and found that it is indeed very beneficial for skin and health. As a skin care product, it includes high levels of omega fatty acids, vitamin K and vitamin E, even more so than argan oil.I decided on this particular brand because it is organic and is a very good price for a 1 ounce glass bottle. Many oils containing prickly pear seed oil are much more expensive and some are blended - not a pure oil like this one. After using the oil for nearly two months, I can say that I do like it with one caveat. It smells bad - not overwhelmingly bad, but an odd earthy smell. The smell dissipates like most oil aromas do but I thought I should warn buyers about this particular aspect. The natural smell may be why some companies blend it with other oils to increase the appeal. However, it is a really nice oil that absorbs quickly and moisturizes for hours. I use it at night and my skin still feels and looks soft the next morning. I have not had any reactions to the oil, and I think that this 1 ounce bottle will last a very long time.Another review mentioned that she thought the oil is too watery and may not be oil at all. I have to disagree with that comment. Not all oils are thick and viscous. Some are quite light and watery. This is a thinner oil but definitely an oil that seems to work very well. I recommend this oil if you are interested in trying a pure, organic prickly pear seed oil at a better price than many other brands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGDO43RIDE9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DII9CYQ#wasThisHelpful","RJGDO43RIDE9Q","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me emphasize that this is a very technical book, one the author even recommends for college level Electrical Engineering course work. The book is filled with detailed summaries of technical knowledge that Electrical Engineers should know upon graduation. While each chapter teaches the facts and equations anyone would likely learn in a typical course on that topic, having it all clearly and expertly summarized makes it an excellent resource for any newly-minted EE.However, donât let the word âSkillsâ in the title give you false expectations. The book is filled with facts and equations, but to me thatâs not the same as skills. To make sure this is the kind of book youâre looking for, be sure to read the table of contents first. I didnât, so I was expecting chapters on skills like working with other Engineers, developing project estimations, giving presentations, troubleshooting, etc. The book is much more a technical resource than a career handbook.The last chapter on finding a job and starting a career is the one non-technical chapter in the book. Itâs full of great information that new graduates probably donât get from their course-work, but the three sections on getting a job, keeping a job and enjoying your career comprise a mere 19 pages combined. What is there is terrific advice, but itâs very high-level and doesnât dive into much detail.Aside from the last chapter, I believe most Electrical Engineers will learn the knowledge presented in this book through any credible EE curriculum. While having all of this knowledge in a summary format is certainly helpful, it wasnât quite what I was expecting based on the title. That said, if youâre looking for a technical refresher you can turn to as you start your EE career with a few job hunting and career tips thrown in, this will be a great resource for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSO4OU6DNZAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118527429#wasThisHelpful","R2FSO4OU6DNZAS","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 9 year old daughter and I read this together and we both had similar opinions about the book. After my daughter read a classic novel, she was read for a more adventurous book. This one delivered the adventure with a great amount of of trouble, misfortune, misunderstandings and evil. The protagonists are children, particularly one girl named Ali, and the antagonists are not fairies but imps. My daughter particularly liked the magic of the imps and the imaginary environments in which they live, but didn't feel any connection to the story or the characters. While the theme isn't new, I was hoping for a more insightful story for my daughter to read. I felt frustrated by plot twists that were too twisted to easily follow and character descriptions which were sadly lacking. There also were too many breaks in the plots twists and story lines which left distracting gaps for the reader. However, it's a decent coming of age story where a nearly middle school aged girl realized her own intelligence and strength to save the day. Unfortunately, that realization is still an imaginary child ""magic"" instead of the innate strength, imagination and understanding that children actually possess.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2JSVIJ6KRR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547859031#wasThisHelpful","RG2JSVIJ6KRR2","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm so glad I purchased this highlighter set. My daughter is using a reading method called text mapping and she uses several different colors of highlighters. Traditional highlighters were too bright on the page but the mild, pastel color set is much easier on the eyes. The lighter colors also make it easier to read the text beneath the highlighted color. This brand works very well although I can't yet comment on how long they last. For now they mark easily and with less color strength. I recommend these if you want a softer highlighted effect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JE0EC0A8ORD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027MDL3C#wasThisHelpful","R22JE0EC0A8ORD","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking at these beautiful pencils for several months and was so excited to finally try them. I compared them to my Prismacolor pencils and right away noticed a few differences that might be important to a fine artist. First I will say that they are beautiful, and I like the color on the end of the pencil. If you have a large set, this would make it easy to find what you're looking for. However, the pencil shape is round instead of hexagonal and they easily roll around and off a desk or table. The colors are marked with esoteric names instead of pigment names or numbers. If you work in multi-media art it will take work to match one of these pencil colors to the color of a paint. The colors are very pretty, but I when comparing to my current set I thought they were less smooth and did not blend as easily as the Prismacolor. I blended by using a colorless blending pencil and a lighter color pencil, and with both techniques the Tombow pencils were still too rough. My final thoughts after using them is that they might work better for crafters who do not rely on pigment names, or for students who are moving to a middle quality pencil for their art.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G33IKWGKJI2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRILWZY#wasThisHelpful","R3G33IKWGKJI2A","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few sets of drawing pencils and find that each manufacturer makes their pencils a little different. I was excited to try the set by Tombow and my first reaction when I opened the package was surprise that most of the pencils are in the soft range. In fact 4 of the pencils are soft, 1 is an HB, and 1 is a 2H. Most other artists pencils sets include as least one more hard pencil. For example my Faber-Castell set includes 4H, 2H, H, HB, B, 2B, 4B, and 6B. Most of my art is botanical so this range is great for me.I compared Tombow's set to both my Faber-Castell and Palomino sets. Like other reviewers stated, the Tombow pencils laid down dark and they are quite soft. When comparing the 4B's, the Tombow was the darkest followed by the Palomino and then the F-C. In fact the Tombow 4B drew as dark as my Derwent Graphic 9B. The Tombow graphite is rather soft but smooth, and the finish on the pencils is is the slickest of all my sets. I did notice that the pencils slipped a bit as I sketched. When I sharpen pencils, I prefer to use a metal hand sharpener by KUM because I think electric sharpeners take off too much and ""eat up a pencil."" The Tombow pencils sharpened to a beautiful point. My favorite piece of the set is the MONO Zero eraser. I don't have an eraser this small and found that I really like using it in small and tight parts of my drawing. Overall I think they are a nice pencil to use the the set is quite nice for a nice price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKHAWYVLMSXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRLV1YI#wasThisHelpful","R1QKHAWYVLMSXM","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to use high quality skin care and like I to use a moisturizing oil as night. Argan is one of my favorite oils to use on my normal to combination skin. In a few seconds after applying, it sinks right into my skin makes it so soft. In the morning, I wake up to soft and healthy looking skin that is not oily or dried out. The 1 ounce size of argan oil in this set has lasted me a long time. I ordered it over 3 months ago and still have over half a bottle left. Naturally, I used the cleanser the fastest and I won't buy this again. It is a creamy fluid that isn't to my liking, and I didn't feel like my skin was thoroughly cleaned. I did like the moisturizing lotion, which I use during the day if I don't wear sunscreen. For my skin type, it goes on smoothly and adds just the right amount of moisture. It may not be enough if you have very dry skin though.

"Lonely Planet has published some very nice books and this is no exception. It is not a large book at 9 3/4 x 7 1/2"" in size, but at over 200 pages it touches on many of the great natural and man made wonders of the world. I do say ""touches on"" because the information given is brief. I would consider this book an introduction to each wonder, with enough photos and graphics to start research for a student or spark the imagination of young and old alike. Even though the book is not encyclopedic, the information is more than just a picture, title and esoteric paragraph. There was enough thoughtfulness and consideration given by the author so that some amount of details are presented to explain the origin of the wonder. The only suggestion I'd make for the book is to add the location to the name of each wonder title. Otherwise, my family has thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I'd recommend it as a helpful resource for the student, the curious or the traveler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBI4807BG16JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743214308#wasThisHelpful","RBI4807BG16JA","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I hoped that the decoration pen tape would be just as much fun. It is easy to use - you just click the end, like a ball point pen, roll and release. The pen lays down a decorative tape. I purchased two pens and one works perfectly so far, but the other doesn't cut the tape when I finish rolling. I had one instance where the tape just came out wrong.

"I use many Suki products and I really like all of them. Again, Suki put a great deal of care into this body scrub and it does work. One reason I continually use Suki skin and body care is the organic quality. Her products are really and truly organic - not just a little bit. Like the exfoliating cleanser (a must-have for me,) the body cleanser exfoliates with oil and sugar. The sugar is not as harsh as other exfoliants and then it dissolves as you use it. The body oil works in tandem with the oils to exfoliate and soften at the same time. The natural, slightly citrus aroma is a nice addition. It does come in a glass jar, which I prefer to plastic, but a little care in the shower is needed. Organic sugar isn't just safer for our bodies, it's safer for the environment too -no small plastic beads or bits going down the drain, which don't often get filtered in our water systems. These plastic beads have now shown up in the ocean and in some of our lakes. I only gave the scrub four stars instead of five because of the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELGWX7T2Y0HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XG8GR2#wasThisHelpful","R2ELGWX7T2Y0HF","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first impression of the L'Occitane Almond body oil was a good one. It is a pretty glass bottle of 3.4 oz., which is a good size. While the ingredients are not organic, they are also not too bad for a conventional body product, although I did not check the ingredients against a source like ewg.org. However, here is one exception - perfume/fragrance, which is listed third in the ingredient list. And it is a strong, synthetic fragrance that is an irritant for people like myself who have sensitivities to perfume. If you don't have any sensitivity to perfume, you may like this body oil, but it is not a soft, floral or herbal scent. It is definitely a perfume which could clash with any other fragranced bath and body product.The packaging for the oil says it provides 48 hours of hydration, which is what the 48H means on the box. It does a nice job of moisturizing the skin, but I did not notice 48 hours of hydration.  It probably performs much the same as other body oils that are priced lower. I've decided to include the list of ingredients here because they are very hard to find online: sweet almond oil, capric triglyceride, parfume/fragrance, oleyl alcohol, camelina seed oil, rosa canina fruit oil, sunflower seed oil, bergamot fruit oil, carrot seed oil, tocopherol, dioleyl tocopheryl methylsilanol, limonene, linalool and citrol.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSX9NPTA4VSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMJF09M#wasThisHelpful","R1LSX9NPTA4VSP","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Evan as a fairly technical person, I had some difficulties setting up the Zepp golf swing analyzer, and I attribute most of the problems to poor instructions. There are no instructions in the box whatsoever, just an easily-missed card with a web address.At the web site, step one is to download the app - easily done. Step two is to turn on the Zepp unit, but the picture indicates the power button with a dot on the top surface NEAR the corner, when youâre actually suppose to press ON the corner in towards the center. I spent 10 frustrating minutes just trying to turn the unit on, and didnât succeed until I found a support page with more clear instruction.Step three is pairing, which was straight forward, but after pairing I got a pop-up on the iPhone saying âThe accessory âARTâ uses an app you do not have installed. Would you like to get it from the App store?â  A search on Zeppâs web site turned up nothing and I ultimately chose to IGNORE the note and not get whatever App it was referring to. This hasnât caused any problems so far, but itâs a little disturbing to think that I may be missing something important.Step four is mounting the device to my golf glove. This works best with a tight fitting glove. One of my gloves was a little large around the wrist such that only the back part of the tab contacted the velcro on the glove - the Zepp consumed this small patch of velcro so the tab had nothing to stick to.At step five you launch the app and are immediately required to enter an email address to create an account. Thereâs no way around this account creation, yet none of Zeppâs documentation talks about needing an account or any features or benefits of having an account. Fortunately it doesnât require any verification of your email address, so you can probably get away with any random selection of characters that includes an @ and a dot. The sole purpose of asking seems to be for Zeipp to build an email list.This is where the web setup instructions end and you now follow the instructions within the App. First up is entering things like gender, height and handicap, and then it asks for details about your clubs. The App did not list my older TaylorMade R7 driver so I chose a different TaylorMade model. Iâm not sure how much this affects the analysis or if it would have been better to leave it as generic - again no help from the Zepp web site on this.Once I finally got the glove, the club and the app all set up, the Zepp sensor had turned off from lack of use. Unfortunately itâs not clear from the App (until youâve used it a while) that the sensor is off and it took a while to figure out why things werenât working. After finally turning the sensor on I again struggled to make it work until I figured out you have to hit the yellow icon to calibrate it first (by standing still at address for three seconds). Some step-by-step flow would be nice here so you donât have to guess what to do next.With all the problems solved I was finally able to capture some swing data, which is actually simple and automatic. Just take a swing and the iPhone beeps and draws a line showing your club head path. You can rotate the view to look at the swing path from front, back, side and above. It also gives you some specific swing data like the ratio of time spent in the back swing vs. the down swing, club speed, and something called club plane %.Unfortunately thatâs where the app ends.  Thereâs no specific advice, either in the app or on their web site, about how to use this data to improve your swing. All you really have is the comparison to âproâ swings to try to figure out how to improve your numbers.Overall it shows some interesting data and graphics, but the documentation is very poor and the app seems like it could offer a bit more analysis and instructions. It might work out well to use this app in coordination with a swing coach so youâll have someone who can tell you HOW to achieve better numbers, or if all those better numbers even apply to your swing.  At the cost of a couple of golf lessons I suppose this might be worth it for the avid golfer whoâs already familiar with their swing and wants to do some fine tuning. But if youâre not at that point yet, you may be better off putting the money towards some lessons and playing time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HQKA0ROONDVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRJCI58#wasThisHelpful","R3HQKA0ROONDVU","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I'd try a big watch (finally) but didn't want to pay much for one. I chose this timex because I like the chronograph look and function, the brand is dependable and I wanted a white leather strap for summer. The dial looks very nice in person and the chronograph dials for day, date, and 24 hour are not just decorative. This is a nice feature for such an inexpensive watch. The strap is a padded leather that is a little stiff, but I hope will soften with use. The dial is very large, stylish and easy to read. That being said, I do find it a little cumbersome to wear. I have small wrists and after fastening it as far as it can go the watch falls down onto my hand which feels like its in the way.

I like that the products, except shampoo and conditioner, are packaged in glass bottles instead of plastic containers. I appreciate the high percentage of organic ingredients as compared to other brands that label their products as organic but may in fact contain less than 50% organic ingredients.

"I use pigment ink pens frequently in my sketchbooks and illustrations, and there are two brands that I use the most often. I started with the Sakura Micron Pigma Ink pens and loved them. My husband bought me this set and I have been extremely happy with them too. In both pens, the ink is waterproof, very black, and archival quality. In fact both sets seem almost identical so it seems hard to choose which pen set to use. After much use of both brands, I have chosen Staedtler as my favorite. First I should note that when comparing the tip sizes of both brands, I found they were not the same. For example, the Sakura .05 is noticeably  larger than the Staedtler .05 tip, which doesn't make sense but that's what I noticed when comparing the two sets. That size difference is one reason I like Staedtler better. The fine tip of the .05 pen tip is more precise and that precision is necessary in some of my artwork. The tips of the Staedtler seem to hold up to extensive use better, and I just like the feel of these pens better. The Sakura have a slick finish and the Staedtler have a matte finish that I find is more comfortable to hold for a long period. The cons for buying the Staedtler is priceâthey are more expensive, and availability. The Sakura are easy to find just about anywhere art supplies are sold. If you don't use pigment ink pens very often and don't need precisely drawn lines, then the Sakuras might be just fine for you. But for fine art work, I have chosen the Staedtler as my favorite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301VO4BG0F941/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L87XRA#wasThisHelpful","R301VO4BG0F941","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you're familiar at all with Indianapolis you'll recognize many of the locations described in the book.

"This set and many of its pieces are customized for building the specific vehicles in the instructions. Many of the pieces are more decorative than useful. It's more like a model car kit with metal pieces than a set that you could use to build generic structures.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, just something to be aware of.Unfortunately we encountered problems from the very first step. The battery compartment is something you assemble like a clam shell from two different plastic pieces. Somehow I received two of the SAME piece which didn't fit together and I had to snip several bits of plastic off one piece to make it work and hold the batteries.In the process of building both vehicles, there were steps where pieces didn't fit together as shown and I had to move some pieces to make it work. I also had to add washers as spaces in the gear assemblies to make the gears mesh properly.Worst of all, the completed model performed horribly.  The motor supplied with the kit does not have enough horsepower to drive the wheels. If you turn the motor on while holding the car in the air the wheels spin very fast, but as soon as you put it on the floor the motor stalls and the car just sits there.We found it worked better on bare floor than carpet, but then we ran into another problem. The screws holding the front wheels onto the axel aren't quite long enough to allow the wheels to spin freely so one of the screws (depending on whether you're going forwards or backwards) always tightens as the wheel spins. So after about two feet of travel one of the wheels will seize up and again the motor stalls.Steering had it's own set of issues.  The structure provided no mechanism to hold the steering gear tightly against the rack so even after I fixed the wheel problem (with long screws and a lot of spacers) the car would always veer hard to the right.  I spent a fair amount of time trying to adjust the alignment and the steering mechanism without success.Needless to say I was extremely disappointed with this Erector set and would not recommend it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZDB4RO5KT9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HS5JU8#wasThisHelpful","R1RZDB4RO5KT9A","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Charles Finchâs first book received so many good reviews and was an Agatha Award nominee, so I had high hopes for âAn Old Betrayal.â Finch is a good writer and reading this book was pleasant, with pleasant characters and a pleasant scene. Finchâs writing style is smooth, and as a bit of an Anglophile myself, I especially enjoyed reading about English social customs in the Victorian period, and the etymological insight into English words and phrases.This book may have been a nice, comfortable read but the mystery was a little lacking. Even with the slight surprise at the end, I still knew too many answers too soon. There are also quite a few unrealistic events and character interactions in this story, but that doesnât detract from this particular book because it lacks the grit and gore of modern crime fiction. Itâs obvious that your reading a gentle, Victorian crime novel and should be enjoyed as such. I did feel that the main characters had been fully developed with a familiar repartee between the two main characters, Charles Lenox and his former protÃ©gÃ©e, John Dallington.While âAn Old Betrayalâ lacks the substance and nuance of an Agatha Christie, Martha Grimes, P.D. James or Elizabeth George, it is still a nice novel for who like a British crime story mixed with insight into the British Parliament and Victorianna. If this is your cup of tea, then I recommend Finchâs âAn Old Betrayalâ to you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROL2WN8GMU0FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250011612#wasThisHelpful","ROL2WN8GMU0FR","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At the time I didn't realize that ""Quartet"" was the brand name.  Sure, I should have double checked the details before buying, but at the very least they should put ""Board"" singular in the title.The word ""Tin"" in the title is also misleading - I was expecting solid metal whiteboards but this feels like there's a VERY thin metal film over plastic that's wrapped around a piece of plain cardboard.  It's very light - if it weren't magnetic you'd never know there was any metal at all.  Overall it feels very cheap.  Even so, getting four at the price I paid might have been worth it, but for only one I definitely did not get my money's worth. For the price of four of these boards to make a reasonably sized whiteboard on the wall you could buy something much bigger and nicer.As far as performance, the marker writes fine and the board works like any other cheap whiteboard. It erases OK but does a leave some ghosting.  The magnets hold fairly well. One magnet can hold up 5 sheets of letter copy paper. I haven't tried hanging it on the wall yet, but it does come with double-sided sticky pads for the purpose.It's a perfectly usable whiteboard and the magnets are a bonus. I just think it's expensive for a single board.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SODHYAIA3CIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZXFDY6#wasThisHelpful","R1SODHYAIA3CIS","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you have children with insatiable appetites for information?  Then you should add this encyclopedia to your bookshelf. The Knowledge Encyclopedia, by DK and Smithsonian, is full of amazing information presented in a more amazing visual way. Itâs incredible that so much information on a single topic can be found on only two pages, but that is the format used for this encyclopedia. Yet, it works beautifully, and it doesnât intimidate or overwhelm young minds. The text is given in small text blocks or paragraphs, key information is in color blocks, and most important for a childrenâs encyclopedia the pages are full of graphics that are stunning as well as informative. Both of my daughters, ages 7 and 9, say they really like the Knowledge Encyclopedia and they have spent many hours pouring over the pages and learning something new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HYBSMJX25TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465414177#wasThisHelpful","R23HYBSMJX25TC","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I see a collaborative publication by the likes of DK and Smithsonian, I am immediately interested in its contents. The âHistory Year By Yearâ is an historical encyclopedia for kids that doesnât disappoint. The pages of contents are laid out in a timeline that is organized by historical period, which makes searching for events logical and easy. Each event is presented on only two pages so that children are not overwhelmed. However, that doesnât mean these pages are lacking in pertinent information. Indeed, they are full of great historical information presented in small text blocks and paragraphs, along with graphic aids and fantastic illustrations and photos which follow the timeline of the particular event. Interspersed throughout the pages are quotes by archeologists, historians, photographers, museum curators, and other experts to lend an authentic and personal perspective to the information. Most importantly, is that my two daughters loved it and spent hours pouring over the pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24IYZZM4TPA0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465414185#wasThisHelpful","R24IYZZM4TPA0T","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pardon my pun in the title, but I'm not overly impressed by this blow dryer. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it's weight. It's quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don't know if I'll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it's an indication of quality.I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don't know if mine just doesn't fit well, but that was a little annoying.It may seem like I'm being knitpicky in this review, but I'm just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer. After saying all that, it does what it's supposed to do - dry my hair. If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I'll be really happy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGICYJAXDIDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB8ZIW0#wasThisHelpful","R2SGICYJAXDIDL","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really didn't think that these shears would make a cut that is better or different than my current, large craft scissors. I was wrong. The Fiskars Amplify Mixed Media Shears really do make a smother, cleaner cut through thicker materials. I cut through several layers of cardstock, cardboard, matboard, thick felt, and an outdoor vinyl fabric using both the Fiskars and the large craft scissors that I already own. The Fiskars Amplify consistently cut through the materials with a much smoother edge than my other shears. These shears don't actually make cutting thick materials easier, it just cuts more smoothly. I only gave the shears 4 stars because the grip seems a little small even for my hands, which aren't large by any means. Other than that, I'd recommend these shears to any crafter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4AVYI5EQO60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRIWZC8#wasThisHelpful","R3K4AVYI5EQO60","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided on this particular Dirt Devil Bagless Upright vacuum to use on the second floor of our house. The upstairs doesn't get as dirty as downstairs so I thought a smaller upright vacuum would suffice. I liked that it was bagless, and has a hose and attachments. But after using it, I learned that it really won't work as a full time vacuum on any space larger than a studio apartment. It is very hard to push and it has insufficient suction to really clean. On my model, it can be difficult to lower the head of the vacuum and it seems like there isn't enough space between the roller and the floor creating a drag when vacuuming. The attachments are handy, but again there's not enough suction power to thoroughly clean even small or tight spaces. It is a small upright vacuum, but it's heavy and loud for its size. I'll end up using it for spot vacuuming light messes, but not for any actual vacuuming.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IKN84HXON4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APKQSNS#wasThisHelpful","R11IKN84HXON4G","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a very hard time wearing conventional fragrances. Most perfumes/fragrances give me a headache, and I find that most essential and aromatherapy oils smell a little too much like a health food store. I was excited to find Tata Harper's Aromatic Treatments and chose this one (Irritability) because of the many great reviews. When I first tried it, I was pleasantly surprised. It did not smell like a chemical, department store perfume, but it didn't smell like the health food store either. It's a lovely and yet complex floral/herbal scent. I was trilled that it did not give me a headache either. As another reviewer said, only a little bit is needed and it does last all day. Now, for the negative aspect: the scent started out so pleasant and then faded to something reminiscent of OFF. Yes, I do mean the insect repellant. Now, that could just be my body chemistry but I thought I'd warn potential customers that it may not work for you. I think it would be worth a try to get a sample from Tata Harper before spending the money on a full sized bottle. And the change in the product's aroma is the reason that I only give it 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OMAVGCEVGC83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042UE3TS#wasThisHelpful","R2OMAVGCEVGC83","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are new to creating fonts or digital lettering, then I think you'll find this book useful. The book is not for the the creative person who wants to learn how or be inspired to draw fonts or unique letting techniques. Instead, it introduces you to the more technical points of font creation, such as x-height, cap height, weight, eye and other parts of a glyph or typeface. The book is mostly a collection of font artists' work with a grid page that follows on which one can practice drawing. The author does encourage studying and practicing drawing letters, which is obviously good advice since ""practice makes perfect"" with any endeavor. I think the most important information in this book is understanding letter forms, typefaces and full fonts, if you are just beginning to create your own fonts or if you like lettering and wish to take them digital. Understanding digital fonts is the next important aspect of this book. The author explains the differences in digital typefaces, quickly explains how to create a digital font, and introduces the reader to digital type creation tools. No part of the book is explained in detail, but is for the beginner or novice. With that in mind, Tony Seddon wrote a font book that gets right to the point for a budding font artist to get started.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CUKA16OPNWC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616891262#wasThisHelpful","R3CUKA16OPNWC2","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unfortunately I found this book to be poorly written, overly wordy and unfocused. I say unfortunate because it has a few real pearls of wisdom, like the 6 P's of Innovation (which I believe Andy Bruce developed many years ago), but the book does an extremely poor job of expanding on these pearls beyond just listing them.The book has far too many useless, wordy passages that drone on and on - I get the feeling they were paid by the word.  There are lengthy definitions (with pros and cons) for common things like video conferencing, electronic databases, blogs, even email! (that's right, a definition with detailed pros and cons of EMAIL)  One so-called quick tip is ""Schedule a monthly half an hour to search the Internet for potential sources of ideas and information...""  Do the authors really think there's a person alive that wouldn't think to search the Internet - and only 30 minutes a month?The formatting and diagrams are terrible. Unreadable screen shots of a SofTools web page randomly appear in the middle of text with no explanation and no reference to them. One diagram that's supposed to help explain an ideas filter is actually a funnel with things going into the top AND OUT of the top - I would call this overflow, not filtering. I don't believe I found a single diagram that improved the understanding of a topic and some added confusion.It's bad enough that the book offers so little useful (and so much useless) information, but there are even places where I think the information can be misleading.  For example the authors write ""The process [of portfolio management] should be simple and easy to follow, but it should also reflect best practice - this can be a difficult balance as one often works against the other.""  If a practice is not easy to follow then it's not the best.  But even if the ""best"" practice is complicated, the implication that you should do something less than the best if it's too hard makes me wonder if the author's are truly interested in my success.Overall this book is a jumbled mess that's boring and hard to read. The little bits of good information are hard to extract and provide only the highest level of understanding.  If I had paid the $25 price listed on the back cover (or even half that price) I would have been first in line for a refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30E9PQZNRT2KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=013296483X#wasThisHelpful","R30E9PQZNRT2KU","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found the Epson WF-2540 to be easy to print to both wired and wirelessly. Print quality is very good in black-and-white but only acceptable for color photos.  Compared to an older Canon MP560 using the same high quality photo paper the colors from the Epson printer are less vibrant and less saturated.  Scanning quality is good - about what you'd expect from an all-in-one.  I do like the auto-feeder that lets you stack up to 30 documents and scan or copy them all at once without having to lift the lid and swap sheets, but it's fairly slow.  It's convenient if you can set it up and then go do something else for a while. Since I don't have a land-line I was not able to test the faxing capabilities.Setting up the WF-2540 on the wireless network was easy and configuring my iMac to print to and scan from it was a snap.  It was also simple to print to it from my iPhone and iPad using the epson iPrint app.  After I updated firmware on the printer I was even able to print from these iOS devices directly without the need for the Epson app.  Wireless printing from all devices has been glitch free, except you do have to remember to turn (or leave) the printer on.I did go through the original inks very fast.  I don't know if the included inks have less than the normal replacements or if I will always go through it that fast.  There are XL versions of the replacement cartridges that claim to have more ink. I did notice there seems to be fewer 3rd-party options for replacement ink cartridges and they are much more expensive than the 3rd-party replacements for my Canon.Another negative is that the printer only has one way to feed paper - from the back.  So you have to change paper every time you change the type of print you're making.  I prefer printers with a paper tray that I can load with standard paper and then when I need to print an envelop or a photo I can load that into a bypass slot in the back without having to remove paper.So for now my Canon MP560 will remain my go-to printer/scanner and I'll use the Epson as a back-up.  If I go through the next batch of Epson inks as fast as the first I'll probably stop using it for prints and only use the scanner when I need the sheet feeder.  But if you find this WF-2540 at a good price and you don't need top-quality photo prints it will probably be a solid performer for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2441SN1QO8TBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091UBCAW#wasThisHelpful","R2441SN1QO8TBB","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TL-WR702N from TP-LINK is a fine choice for the knowledgeable user looking for a travel WAP, but NOT for the novice.I have used a number of WAPs and Bridges and this one works as well as any.  It's not the fastest product in its category, but the price is right for what you get.  My only real issue is with the documentation which I think would be nearly impossible for the novice to follow.Having set up products like this before I didn't really need the documentation except for the default IP address, but even that was hard to find.  The paper documentation in the box gives only definitions of the various modes in English - all the detailed setup instructions are in other languages (fortunately the IP address needs no translation). It does list a URL for more details but that leads to nothing but a 404 error.  I was able to find the details on the company's web site after some searching but not only were the instructions hard to follow, they were incredibly outdated (they still refer to Internet Explorer 6.0).I should also point out that the product is amazingly small and light.  That's a good thing if you're traveling with it, but with no rubber feet it's so light that the weight of its own power cable can pull it off the table. It took some tinkering to get it to stay where I wanted it.Overall I'd say the TL-WR702N is a reasonable choice as long as you know what you're doing it.  Otherwise I'd stick with a more mainstream brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZ2BX2BV2GD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PTCFFW#wasThisHelpful","R2BZ2BX2BV2GD1","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had reservations because it was so much less expansive than other iPad covers, but it has excellent build quality, fits perfectly, is easy to use and has some nice features not found in other covers.  I've been using it for about 2 months now and have no complaints.  The cover clicks closed just right and has the magnets to lock/unlock the ipad. It props up the ipad at 4 different landscape angles.I don't use the back hand strap as much as I thought I would but mostly because I've learned how to hold/prop the ipad so that I don't need it. When I first started using it the bottom corner tabs that you have to pop the ipad out of to prop it up fit a little snug but they've loosened up just a bit over time and it's now a simple operation.The elastic strap to hold the cover open and the pen loop are nice extras.

"My daughters, ages 8 and 6, and I had fun for a few hours after receiving the StampingGear set. It's extremely easy to use, and the video that is included on the product page clearly demonstrates its ease of use. We began by just practicing on plain paper. Even my 6 year old got the hang of using the cog and wheel system very fast. The set comes with plenty of cling stamps and both oval and circular cogs and wheels. You do need fairly large paper when using the outside of the wheels, and square paper works great with the circle. Of course, you don't have to stamp right in the middle of a sheet of paper or a card. Stamped designs that bleed off the edge look great. After practicing, we then started to make actual stamped items such as cards, fancy envelopes and gift tags. I also think stamping on plain wrapping paper in holiday colors would be very pretty. We don't make a great deal of paper crafts in our house so our one problem with the StampingGear set was what to make after we made several cards with matching envelopes. The set plus many colors of ink pads make incredible designs so in the end we decided on wall art. We framed our favorite designs and now have a beautiful display. The Inkadinkado website also has many great ideas to inspire you so I'm sure a stamper is only limited by her/his imagination. If you like to stamp, I'm sure you'll like this set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCRSS4AKNUUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QNY2AS#wasThisHelpful","R3JCRSS4AKNUUD","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using the wool dryer balls for more than a month now, and admit my surprise when I discovered that they actually work as described. I was looking for a natural way to eliminate static cling and fluff my laundry, and this was the product that I decided to try. I used the dryer balls in a load of towels for the first time, and they did indeed come out soft and fluffy. Next, I used them with a load of jeans, and this load too ended up soft and fluffy. By that second load, I was quite impressed. Then I washed and dried a load of color laundry and forgot to place the dryer balls in with it, and because of two acrylic nightgowns, there was static cling. I put in all three of the wool dryer balls and ran the load on the fluff cycle for 20 minutes. Wow, the static cling was gone and the clothes seemed a bit softer too, all without the use of chemicals or fragrance. I searched around for more scientific information about how they work - is it the natural fibers or the lanolin found in wool - but to no avail.

"I absolutely love Melissa & Doug products for small children, and this box of art supplies is no exception. First, it is a box full of art necessities for little ones. In one package are two boxes with hinge lids of triangular shape crayons, a box of triangular shaped chalk, box of triangular shape color pencils with great colors (including gold and silver,) and a box of non-roll markers. All the coloring products stay on the table and stay in one piece for much longer! The boxes also come with a pad of color constructions paper, a drawing pad, and a more artist grade, acid free drawing pad. You can buy cheaper drawing pads but I think the M&D paper is closer to young artist quality paper from art supply shops. My daughters LOVE the color pencils. They are bigger and are easier to hold, and the colors are beautiful with a really nice range of colors. The jumbo crayons are good too, but they are a hard, waxy consistency and do leave the balls of wax on the paper. The 18 piece set has been fun to use because the box has a carrying handle - making it easy to carry to the park with a pad of paper. Overall, I recommend this drawing set for young children.

"The B&D Platinum hand held vacuum does a good job vacuuming small messes. It seems to have plenty of suction, and works great for areas likes cleaning stair treads or the car. It took approximately 4 hours to charge the battery, and the charge will last me an entire week of small cleaning jobs.The vacuum has a couple of flaws, which I consider minor for how I use it. It is quite noisy for such a small machine. I use it for short periods of time and only a few times a week so the noise isn't a persistent issue. The vacuum also does not have a bracket to mount the battery charger on the wall next to an outlet. A wall mount bracket for the charger and another for the vacuum would be a very nice feature for convenient storage in the garage or utility room.All things considered, I do like the B&D Platinum Slide Pack vacuum.

The writing is average--not great, and the story moves at a rather fast pace. It lacks what a good crime novel should - a good crime. I figured out the the who, what and where just too quickly. Of course, that may be because I felt like I've read this story before. For a novel to be good, crime or otherwise, it needs to be interesting, original, and well written.

"love a good crime novel and was excited to read a new author, especially after reading such great reviews of Vincent Zandri's other works. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed with ""The Innocent."" Yes, it's an easy read, but it's just a little clichÃ© for my taste. Zandri used the usual elements for his story: a scarred hero, a misunderstood female who is a bit of an intellectual but easily abused, the loyal female sidekick, and the usual group of criminal types who all have a good reason for turning to crime. Throw in a light Indiana Jones moment, an attempt at a shocking ending, and the result was a predictable and rather boring story. I feel like I'm being generous giving it two stars, but it's easy to read and just interesting enough to finish.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115QGI0QEJJS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612183468#wasThisHelpful","R115QGI0QEJJS4","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give this book 3 stars mostly for the interesting facts about Fenway Park, but it wasn't really what I was expecting. The book is actually pretty hard for me to categorize. The clunky ""A is for..."" rhymes and the lack of photographs or quality illustrations make it not really suitable as a coffee table book.  The fact that the illustrations aren't targeted at kids coupled with the fine-print historical facts in the margins means it doesn't make a great children's book.  And while there are a number of interesting facts on every page, it's not really comprehensive enough to satisfy a die-hard Red Sox fan.  But if you're looking for a different and a little bit quirky book about Fenway Park you might enjoy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R543IY54KN29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585367885#wasThisHelpful","R543IY54KN29","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with most books for children, the themes of good triumphing over evil, loyalty and friendship are common. However, it never hurts to read about and learn them often. In Barry Wolverton's novel ""Neversink,"" the story is told with mostly Northern birds, and with Scandinavian folklore in the mix. The story has adventure, unlikely friendship, and a lesson in the ways of greed and politics. I especially enjoyed the protagonist's, a Puffin, love for his wife and unborn Puffling, his respect for the elder on the island, and his open-minded friendship with a walrus and hummingbird. They are an unlikely crew that knows what's right and will risk their pride, tradition and lives to save their fellow citizens and home. The true test is how well my seven year old daughter liked the book, and it was a hit with her. It moved at a fast enough pace to keep her interested, and it helped open a dialog about a American history, and how to pick and keep good friends. I do recommend this book, but will warn you that it contains mild elements of threat, deceit and death. It is mild enough, however, that my daughter wasn't scared but did learn about unhappy but real elements of life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KF03PNVRO65N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062027913#wasThisHelpful","R3KF03PNVRO65N","ACA3DUGEW0QFY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACA3DUGEW0QFY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about this story. On the one hand, John Grisham wrote a smooth, easy to read story. But I felt like more could have been told about Joe Castle and Paul Tracy. I'd even consider this more a novella than a novel. I'm an amateur baseball fan at best, but I do have more knowledge about the culture of baseball after reading this book. I just feel there was more to learn about the characters.

"The Goalrilla Torch portable floodlight is a very nice multipurpose LED floodlight that is mainly designed for outdoor sporting events where you need to light up a playing field at night. The entire floodlight assembly comes in pieces inside a large carrying case with wheels. You get a two-way pump for inflating the protective padding around the central support tube, tripod support legs, high-visibility ""wing"" flags that connect to the legs and center pole (so players can easily spot the light stand and avoid hitting it) as well as a set of ground anchors.The single biggest complaint I have about the product (and the reason it only gets 4 stars instead of 5) is that the rechargeable battery pack is NOT included. This floodlight retails for $350 on the manufacturer's website and that's a lot to pay for an LED floodlight without a power source ... even if it does have great padding and high-visibility flags to help with sporting events.As I previously mentioned, this floodlight works fine as a multipurpose light and doesn't have to be limited to sports use. I've used this as a ""studio light"" for taking product photos and shooting YouTube videos ... and it works great. I also plan to use this at a neighborhood party around Halloween so all the kids have a well-lit area to play.Just be aware that you need to buy a separate battery if you want to use this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NDPVH6TFRS3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRD1CEK#wasThisHelpful","R2NDPVH6TFRS3H","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Casio Solar-Powered Digital Watch has been around in one form or another since the 1980s and is still one of the best low-cost digital watches on the market ... assuming you aren't a cave dweller who never leaves your basement.As the name suggests, this is a 100% solar-powered digital watch; you never have to buy one of those stupid little watch batteries again. Electrical power comes from a small bank of solar panel cells that feed electrical current to a capacitor inside the watch. The capacitor essentially acts as a battery and as long as you allow the solar panel cells to absorb some light every day the capacitor will stay charged and keep your watch running perfectly.The biggest ""problem"" with this watch is the unfortunately long initial charge cycle for the capacitor (an unavoidable flaw in having a battery-free design). The capacitor is completely dead when you first remove the watch from the box, and since the digital components require a ""relatively"" large amount of voltage the capacitor can't keep up with the demand until it is FULLY charged. This means you have to leave the watch out in the sun (with minimal cloud cover or shade) for a full day and then still charge it under a BRIGHT lamp indoors after the sun goes down for a full night before the capacitor has the charge needed to get started.There is a little ""sun"" icon that appears below the time if the capacitor is running low. Even after the sun icon disappears during the first day of charging you STILL have to leave the watch out to charge (again a full day of sunlight and a full night of bright lamp light at least) for that first charge.After the capacitor has received a full initial charge you won't have to worry about charging it again as long as you spend at least 45-90 minutes outside every day and the solar panel isn't covered by your shirt sleeve. An hour to an hour and a half of sunlight is all this watch needs to keep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night. Granted, even a single low-voltage LED would drain the capacitor VERY quickly and defeat the purpose of having a battery-free watch, but it would have been nice to have a light. I suppose I'm willing to put up with the lack of a light if it means I never have to buy another watch battery and never have to remove the cover from the back of this watch.If a solar-powered and battery-free digital watch sounds like a good idea to you then you'll absolutely love this watch. Just understand how the capacitor works and give it that LENGTHY initial charge it needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24IVJGTD4744/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JVP2T4#wasThisHelpful","R24IVJGTD4744","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dyson V6 Mattress is an updated handheld vacuum from Dyson's newest V6 line. Although it's marketed as a ""mattress"" vacuum you would be silly to only use this for cleaning mattresses. The only thing that is clearly different about this V6 handheld and the other V6 handheld vacuums (other than the color) is that the V6 Mattress includes a dedicated ""motorized mattress tool"" and it may have better HEPA filtration (although I can't tell for sure about the filter).The motorized mattress tool works on carpet and upholstery as well, so again there is little point to only using this vacuum on mattresses. The Dyson V6 Mattress also includes several other vacuum attachments (crevice tool, upholstery brush, etc.), but it doesn't come with the extra-long attachment arm and the wide floor cleaner heads like the ""V6 Absolute"" or ""V6 Motorhead"" vacuums. That said, I don't see the point of using a handheld vacuum for cleaning wide areas of flooring, so the V6 Mattress has all the attachments you really need for the things you'll want to do with a handheld vacuum.Dyson claims the V6 Mattress is quieter to use than the ""V6 Trigger"" handheld; I don't know what the V6 Trigger sounds like, but I can tell you that the V6 Mattress is LOUD. It's not deafening or remotely painful to my ears, but if you turn this on in a room where someone is sleeping they will wake up. Similarly, if someone is watching TV they will have to turn up the volume to hear the TV over the noise from this vacuum ... and the V6 Mattress is certainly more than loud enough to scare the living hell out of our family dog. I guess ""quiet"" is a relative term.Despite being louder than the cheap, under-powered handheld vacuums I've used before, the V6 Mattress is a GREAT vacuum with an AMAZING amount of suction for a handheld. While my wife and I were cleaning our house we kept thinking of that scene from the movie Wayne's World where Mike Meyers is talking about a vacuum and says, ""It certainly does suck!"" The dust cup is easy to empty into the trash and you can clearly see when the cup is getting full and needs to be emptied. The battery life (roughly 20 minutes per charge) is ""decent"" for a handheld vacuum since most of the time you won't use a handheld vacuum on big chores, but if you are a professional cleaner who plans to use this to clean multiple homes every day then you'll need spare batteries.Bottom line, this is a great handheld vacuum (the best one I've ever used) and is a great solution for people who want an awesome handheld vacuum. It isn't perfect (and certainly isn't as quiet as I expected) but this might be about as good as any handheld vacuum gets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXO4OW3WV09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FQ4STC#wasThisHelpful","R1OXO4OW3WV09","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is only so much that I can say about this S'mores Kit from Hershey's; it is what it is ... tasty S'mores.My whole family loves to make S'mores when we go camping, when we hang out next to the fire pit in our backyard, or sometimes just to have fun during a movie night at home. Usually we pick up the S'mores ingredients (Hershey's chocolate bars, Graham crackers and large marshmallows) separately at the grocery store. This seemed like a convenient way to get our S'mores ""fix"" so I decided to give this prepackaged kit a try.The chocolate bars, Graham crackers and large marshmallows are basically the exact same thing that we usually purchase separately at the store, so this is a nice ""one stop shop"" solution to making S'mores at home. This would be a good purchase before a camping trip or as a gift for someone who regularly camps.The only thing ""missing"" from this kit is sticks to use for roasting the marshmallows over an open campfire. Granted, most people just find sticks at a campsite, but I wanted to mention the lack of roasting sticks just so people know what is or isn't included.The only complaint that I have about this product is that since I ordered this during the heat of the summer months and the box wasn't refrigerated during shipping, all of the Hershey's chocolate bars inside my kit arrived partially melted. That isn't the end of the world for S'mores since you're going to melt the chocolate anyway, but it would have been nice if the chocolate bars hadn't arrived melted ... it's hard to break the Hershey's chocolate bars into smaller pieces for S'mores if the bars have melted and re-hardened into chocolate ""bricks.""Don't order this kit during the summer and you should be fine. Alternatively, Amazon could package this kit in a box with dry ice to prevent melting during the summer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NVC52TGY3VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZAWFK8#wasThisHelpful","R10NVC52TGY3VB","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The UP3 from Jawbone is a simple-looking yet feature-packed activity tracker bracelet that works with your iPhone or Android smartphone.Like most wrist-worn health trackers, the UP3 is packed full of sensors to track your every movement from heart rate and steps taken to a detailed breakdown of how active or restful your body was while you slept. While this $180 activity tracker has plenty to offer, Jawbone's Up2 has most of the same features and design elements from the Up3 for just $99.The wrist strap itself is different from Jawbone's previous UP thanks to an adjustable strap with all of the Up3's electronics located in the top of the band directly under the new touch-control surface. You can double-tap the touch surface on the top of the wrist band to switch between sleep and activity modes, while three LEDs let you know which mode you're in (or you can check the ""UP"" app on your smartphone).This brings us to the one notable missing feature on the UP3 which is also an advantage: There is no LCD on this activity tracker. You can't simply glance down at your wrist to check your heart rate or see a chart of the total steps you've taken because the UP3 has no screen. Instead, it sends a wireless signal to your smartphone and updates Jawbone's ""UP"" mobile app. The downside is that you need to have a paired smartphone to use the UP3, but the upside is that the UP3 gets FANTASTIC battery life (roughly a week between charges) because there's no LCD screen sucking the wristband's battery dry.Speaking of ""dry"" ... Jawbone specifically says the UP3 is ""water resistant"" but not ""waterproof"" ... meaning you can leave the UP3 on your wrist when you're washing your hands, taking a shower or doing the dishes but you don't want to wear it while swimming.I'm glad the UP3 is so comfortable to wear, is packed with activity monitoring features via the UP app, and has great battery life. However, the lack of even a small, low-resolution LCD screen means this activity tracker isn't as useful when you're working out. You can't just glance down to see if you're maintaining your target heart rate during your workout or if you need to push yourself a little harder. Pulling out my smartphone breaks my concentration when I'm exercising and that's not ideal.Bottom line, the UP3 and the UP mobile app work together to deliver a great tool for people who want to track their activity and hear rate over a prolonged period of time (like a fitness blogger or someone who is actively trying to loose weight with the help of a physician and needs to provide progress reports to a doctor or personal trainer). However, heart rate monitoring isn't nearly as useful during workouts if you can't check it at a glance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84GTMV79KHXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9E6DUK#wasThisHelpful","R84GTMV79KHXD","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these Philips SHQ2300LF/27 ""ActionFit Sports Earbuds"" are clearly marketed as a nice mid-range set of earbuds (not cheap $5 earbuds but not crazy expensive either), the simple fact is that these earbuds deliver terrible sound quality.I wasn't expecting these Philips earbuds to rival the premium earbuds from Sennheiser, Shure, or Audio Technica priced at more than $100, but given the retail price of these Philips earbuds I expected better quality than what I get from the free earbuds that I get on a long flight. Unfortunately, I put the audio quality from the Philips SHQ2300LF/27 earbuds on par with those free earbuds from airlines.I wouldn't call the audio ""unlistenable"" as other reviewers described, but the highs and midrange tones are shrill and distorted. You can hear and understand music or the audio from a movie, but it isn't very enjoyable. Bass is essentially absent when using these earbuds, so don't even think about using these if you're really into hip-hop, rap, funk, techno, dubstep, or anything with a prominent bassline. Honestly, that last bit makes this product less than ideal as ""sport"" or ""exercise"" earbuds. Likewise, if you're watching an action movie or horror film and using these earbuds the soundtrack and sound effects will sound tinny, hollow and lacking ""impact"" that typically comes from bass.These earbuds also suffer from erratic static problems depending on the audio source. I didn't have a problem with static disrupting the audio when I used these earbuds with my iPhone, but these Philips earbuds suffered from terrible static when I used them with my laptop, my Android tablet, and when I plugged them into a video camera to monitor the sound while recording. I double-checked the audio by plugging them into my iPhone and the static was gone again. In short, I wouldn't rely on these earbuds to deliver quality sound.If these earbuds were priced at $5.99 then you would know what to expect, but the MSRP for these Philips earbuds is $29.99 and that makes this a VERY bad deal. If you can find these on sale or as a free extra with the purchase of another item then they are fine. If you're paying full price then you should consider other earbuds like the Sony MDRXB50AP or the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC23.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1026553QEC5FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3C6JTA#wasThisHelpful","R1026553QEC5FY","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a gift to give my daughter as she ""graduated"" from lower elementary to upper elementary this year and the Sterling Silver and Diamond Infinity Pendant proved to be a wonderful choice.I normally think that infinity pendants are a bit corny or cheesy, but this one is nicely done and it gave me the opportunity to talk to my daughter about the importance of always continuing to learn; that even when we graduate from school life is full of opportunities to learn. I told her that each and every one of us should make an effort to learn something new each day, and that each new day is a blessing because we have a chance to learn something that will make us better tomorrow than we are today.The pendant itself is about the height of a U.S. nickel and the chain is the perfect size for a young girl or a woman with a slender neck. The chain does look a bit fragile and if you're planning to purchase this for an adult woman with a wider neck then you really need to purchase a longer (and thicker) chain for this pendant.Overall, my daughter was pleased to receive this pendant as her ""graduation"" gift and I'm happy she likes it so much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TEW19QC8K1T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJFL888#wasThisHelpful","R3TEW19QC8K1T9","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nerf N-Strike SharpFire blaster is an impressive looking Nerf single-shot blaster with a simple loading method: as you pull back the ""slide"" to load the dart you also charge the firing mechanism so that you can fire.This loading/charging mechanism makes the SharpFire one of the easiest and fastest single-shot Nerf blasters to use during a Nerf war between friends or coworkers. Unfortunately, this blaster is plagued by a few problems.First and foremost, this is the worst performing ""N-Strike"" blaster that I (and my kids) have personally used. Most N-Strike blasters fire with an impressive amount of force at close range and retain good accuracy up to between 30-70 feet (the maximum range usually depending on the condition of the darts). This SharpFire blaster fires darts much more ""softly"" than other blasters; the speed that the dart leaves the blaster is visibly slower, the maximum range of each dart is noticeably shorter, and darts hit the target with almost no force behind them.Second, the modular design is pointless as implemented. The barrel extension serves no purpose, it doesn't improve the accuracy of the darts, doesn't provide a good space for a second hand to grip the blaster, and the front ""sight"" is worthless for aiming since the darts are so underpowered. Likewise, the removable stock serves no purpose other than to provide a convenient place to store your darts when the blaster is not being used. The stock is too short to provide a good shoulder brace when firing (it's not only too short for adults but my five-year-old son is too big to use this stock effectively). The stock is also supposed to function as a ""holster"" for Nerf battles, but you have to reach down and press a button to release the blaster from the stock when you're using it as a holster, so that prevents you from quickly drawing your blaster during play.The weakness of this blaster could arguably be a selling point for parents who are worried that their children will be hurt by foam Nerf darts that are shot with too much force behind them, but in reality it just ruins the fun of shooting Nerf darts at friends. I would only give this blaster to someone in a large group Nerf battle if I was planning to use that person as a human shield or sacrificial bait for opposing players to shoot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLPZPUQ3SM59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD6KJXI#wasThisHelpful","RNLPZPUQ3SM59","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review title says it all. I don't know what kind of miracle metal the people at Doughmakers Gourmet Cookware are using to create the Doughmakers Grand Cookie Sheet, and I don't know the name of the genius who came up with the idea for the ""Original Pebble Pattern"" but this cookie sheet is AMAZING.I'm not an expert chef or baker, but I know the difference between a cookie, bread roll or muffin that is evenly baked to PERFECTION and something that is baked properly on the top and burnt on the bottom. For years my wife and I made cookies and other baked goods that weren't evenly baked and I just thought it was our oven or terrible technique on our part since we aren't artisan chefs. As it turns out, all we needed was better bakeware!The first three batches of cookies that my wife and I made for our family using the Grand Cookie Sheet turned out PERFECT as if we had purchased the cookies from a high-priced bakery. We then decided to try cooking croissants and bread rolls on the cookie sheet and they likewise came out of the oven baked to perfection.Apparently, the ""Original Pebble Pattern"" that Doughmakers uses on its bakeware is the secret. You aren't supposed to use non-stick cooking spray on this bakeware because it will tarnish the metal surface and is difficult to clean out of the embossed pebble pattern. That said, you can grease the bakeware with a stick of butter or use flour if you want. The embossed pattern on the metal allows air flow under the item being baked and that's apparently the secret to both the even baking and why baked items don't stick to the surface.Even if you have to pay the full manufacturer's suggested retail price of $20 to get this cookie sheet it's worth the money. After making a wide variety of cookies and croissants on the Doughmakers Grand Cookie Sheet, my wife and I decided to go out and purchase and entire set of Doughmakers cooking pans! We now own the 9"" x 13"" Cake Pan, Square Cake Pan, Sheet Cake Pan, Loaf Pan and the Muffin Pan.I highly recommend this cookie sheet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282291HET5BSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QCMFYG#wasThisHelpful","R282291HET5BSA","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife is generally not a fan of perfumes and prefers to rely on bathing with good soap and using a quality antiperspirant/deodorant. That said, we decided to give the Calvin Klein euphoria Eau de Parfum a try and we're glad we did.Like many perfumes, euphoria is quite strong and I don't recommend spraying the bottle directly onto your skin or clothing ... otherwise the scent is WAY too strong. This is one of those perfumes where you pretty much have to spray a mist in front of yourself and then walk through the mist so that the intensity of the perfume is reduced. That being said, this perfume smells quite good; like a mixture flowers and fruit.My wife and I are pretty sensitive to strong perfumes and colognes and we get headaches if the scent is too strong, but the euphoria doesn't give either of us headaches as long as my wife doesn't spray the bottle directly onto herself. If you're looking for a nice, clean-smelling perfume with a scent that is reminiscent of flowers and fruit then I'd highly recommend Calvin Klein euphoria.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILH26PECIMG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BIPMC2#wasThisHelpful","R3ILH26PECIMG0","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for some safety glasses that I could use outdoors in bright sunlight or indoors with bright work lights so I decided to give the Jackson Safety V50 glasses a try.On one hand, these are perfect for keeping your eyes shielded from debris while doing yard work or other dirty tasks in a well-lit environment. The polycarbonate lenses are pretty tough and they don't alter my vision the way some cheap safety glasses do. As the item description says, the lenses have an ""anti-fog"" coating and the cushioned pads around the back of the lenses (as well as the ""brow bar"") have small openings or ""slits"" to provide ventilation and further reduce the chance the the lenses will fog up.On the other hand, I have mixed feelings about these safety glasses specifically because of those cushioned (and ventilated) pads around the back of the lenses. Keep in mind that the black foam cushions not only make the glasses more comfortable but they provide an extra barrier to keep debris from getting to your eyes while you work. However, because of the way these glasses are shaped, those cushions also dramatically impair your peripheral vision.If you are using these glasses while driving a riding lawn mower then you REALLY need to turn your head from side to side more frequently to make sure there isn't something just outside your field of view. I likewise can't recommend driving any automobile while wearing these glasses because of the way your peripheral vision is blocked. Granted, most people don't drive while wearing safety glasses, but I wouldn't recommend these for people driving lawn mowers just because a kid or pet could come running up beside you and you won't see anything unless your head is turned in that direction.Other than that issue, I found these safety glasses to be extremely comfortable and useful whenever I need safety glasses with tinted lenses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9J5HX6XRO2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAYXO46#wasThisHelpful","R2V9J5HX6XRO2P","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had a minor problem with moss in our back yard where the trees provide ample shade and an ideal environment for moss. My wife and I were particularly annoyed by the moss because it often spread to the stepping stones in our back yard and made the stones slippery and potentially hazardous to walk on.Since we also had some thin and patchy grass in that area I decided to try Scotts Turf Builder Lawn Food with Moss Control. Within a week the moss problem has vanished in our back yard, so I can confirm that the ""Moss Control"" portion of this Lawn Food works exactly as described. My wife and I are happy that we don't have to worry about family members (or guests) slipping on the moss that was growing on our stepping/paving stones behind the house.I'm a little reluctant to give this product a full five stars because I'm not completely sure how well the ""Turf Builder"" portion of this lawn food works. I have noticed a general thickening of the grass in our back yard, but that is also normal for our lawn in late April and early May. I used Scotts grass seed in the bare spots and that seed has taken well, but it's hard to judge what the ""Turf Builder"" has or hasn't done in terms of helping the grass grow and thicken.In short, if you have a moss problem in your yard then I would highly recommend this product. It definitely kills the moss and it ""probably"" helps the overall health and thickness of your grass. However, I've used other lawn food/fertilizer that made a more obvious improvement to the health of my lawn in previous years when I just wanted to help the grass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZDR2KR3F37N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005W1Q6YG#wasThisHelpful","R3TZDR2KR3F37N","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used several different brands and types of grass seed over the years since I have kids and dogs that play in our front and back yards ... meaning my lawn develops patches of dead or worn grass every year. I've personally had very good results with Scotts brand products of grass seed and fertilizer, so I decided to try a bag of Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed: Sun and Shade Mix.One of the first things you'll notice when you open the resealable bag is that this grass seed look bright blue. That bright blue coating is the Scotts Watersmart Plus Coating, which absorbs extra water for the seed, feeds the seed with some fertilizer, and protects the seed with some fungicide to help keep away fungus that commonly attacks newly planted grass.This might be a total coincidence, but when I've seeded with other types of grass seed in previous years (stuff that isn't coated or looks like regular light brown grass seed) I've had problems with birds eating the grass seed. This year the birds didn't attack the Scotts Turf Builder seeds. I'm wondering if it has something to do with the blue coating ... maybe it makes the seeds harder for birds to see or they think it's something poisonous. Even if it's just a coincidence and there is nothing protecting the seeds from birds, I'm glad the birds didn't devour the grass seed and the seed was able to take root in all of the bare and thin spots in my yard.The species of grass seed in the Sun and Shade mix isn't identical to the majority of grass in my front and back yards, but it blends in nicely and, as I previously mentioned, I've used a wide variety of grass seeds over the years and my lawn is probably a hodgepodge of different grasses.Bottom line, this grass seed is easy to spread, takes root reasonably fast (particularly if your lawn is getting rain or you use sprinklers) and I didn't have any problems with this seed. My only complaint is that the bag is pretty small and that means you'll need multiple bags if you have a lot of bare/thin spots in your yard or you have a large yard. One bag wasn't ""quite"" enough to cover all the spots in my front and back yard (about 1.25 acres).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T5PBBF93X6A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A0YB7S#wasThisHelpful","R1T5PBBF93X6A9","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 6 year old son is a huge fan of Captain America and all Marvel super heroes, so the new Avengers Age of Ultron Captain America Star Launch Shield seemed like a perfect fit for him. He already owns the Captain America Winter Soldier Stealthfire Shield that fires Nerf N-Strike darts, but my wife isn't a huge fan of that shield since it ""shoots"" things. I figured this shield would be a better idea because it fires launch discs (essentially little helicopter pinwheels) off the star in the middle of the shield.Unfortunately, I noticed a problem that deeply worries me while my son and daughter were playing with this shield ... and it's related to the ripcord that is used to launch the star discs/helicopters.At first, my son thought the ripcord was a bit annoying because the mechanism that pulls the ripcord back doesn't pull the line very tight, so the ripcord handle ""dangles"" freely just a bit while he is running with the shield. That was indeed a little annoying, but the bigger problem came about an hour later.My son eventually discovered that after he pulls the ripcord out to launch the star disc he can use it like a garrote wire to ""play choke"" his sister. That concerns me.The ripcord line is just long enough to wrap around a neck of a child, and although my son wouldn't intentionally hurt his sister, I'm amazed that the toy designers at Hasbro didn't recognize this problem and use an internal spring-based launch trigger instead of a ripcord. Granted, I never would have thought about this danger if I hadn't seen my son discover his first garrote while playing in the front yard ... but I don't design toys for a living.This is a legitimate choking hazard.The Captain America Winter Soldier Stealthfire Shield might freak out my wife because it shoots foam darts that could potentially hit someone in the eye ... but it seems less dangerous to me than this shield which has a small rope coming out that is a potential choking hazard for children.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZRHGTXPDMVNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5ZWQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZRHGTXPDMVNF","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've shot with a wide variety of digital cameras since switching from film to digital almost 14 years ago. I shoot professionally and for my own personal satisfaction. The Sony RX1 is one of those few cameras that satisfies BOTH my professional and personal desires while I'm shooting.For starters, the RX1 is compact without being too small and the controls and menu interface are easy to use without being too simple for serious control. You might think it's easy to make a camera that does those things, but trust me, it isn't. Sony struck an almost perfect balance in terms of form and function.The biggest advantage to shooting with this little camera rather than another small ""mirrorless"" camera is image quality. There are many, many ways to define ""image quality"" but in this case I define it as images with the greatest possible detail (high ratio of actual image data rather than ""noise"") combined with an extraordinary dynamic range (detail recorded in both highlight and shadow) and a smooth transition between in-focus and out-of-focus areas (butter smooth bokeh that isn't harsh and distracting).I've shot with a number of full-frame cameras including the Sony A99, A7, A7r, Nikon D700, D600 and Canon 5D mkII. Those cameras are all great, but none of those other cameras (at least not with the lenses I used) deliver the same combination of rich details and insane amount of exposure latitude that comes from the RX1 and its 35mm Zeiss Sonnar T lens with f/2 aperture.I know most people interested in small full-frame cameras are turning to the Sony A7 series and interchangeable lenses, but if you are content with a 35mm lens then the RX1 will not disappoint. The price of the RX1 is higher than it should be now that there are more affordable full-frame cameras on the market, but it still delivers fantastic value when you consider the full frame sensor and the amazing 35mm lens. I've shot side-by-side with RX1 and the Sony A7 and Sony 35mm f/2.8 Zeiss Sonnar T FE ZA lens ... and I personally prefer the images from the RX1.I also own and shoot with several DSLRs and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras for work, but I enjoy shooting with the RX1 because it has everything I care about in a small package. I bought into cameras like the Olympus OM-D and PEN cameras and Sony NEX cameras because I wanted something small, but as soon as I added multiple lenses they where basically small DSLRs with less image quality. The RX1 is small but doesn't compromise on image quality. The Sony A7 series deliver similar quality, but as soon as you start adding lenses you might as well be using a DSLR kit. I'll stick with a full-frame camera that fits in my jacket pocket.Bottom line, if you are a serious (professional) photographer and can afford this camera (and you don't mind being ""stuck"" at 35mm) then there is no better camera than the RX1 in terms of delivering great results in a relatively small package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E00W6DHSF8QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097CXFCC#wasThisHelpful","R3E00W6DHSF8QU","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a huge fan of MTECH knives because the quality isn't particularly good, but they have some interesting designs and as long as they are dirt cheap then they offer a good value.As my review title suggests, I was looking for a cheap assisted-opening knife to use for opening and breaking down a large amount of cardboard boxes and for dirty jobs where I might not want to damage a more expensive pocket knife. The MTECH MX-A804GP is the cheapest pocket knife I've purchased in a long time but it has good ergonomics and a nice spring assisted opening mechanism.This knife is a ""flipper"" design, meaning that when the knife is folded in the closed position you press on the exposed ""nub"" sticking out the back of the knife handle and the knife blade will swing forward rapidly (because of a spring that ""assists"" in swinging the blade out) and locks into place using the liner lock in the handle.The ""flipper"" becomes a finger guard when the knife blade is exposed, and that adds a sense of safety when using this knife for various cutting tasks. The liner lock is pathetically thin and won't handle abuse, but if you're just opening boxes and doing basic cutting tasks then the liner should hold up fine. My blade was well centered, but even if it wasn't I doubt I would have cared because this is essentially a ""disposable"" knife for light/medium work where you need to repeatedly cut cardboard, carpet, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VOQ9WPRH0ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2M0WFG#wasThisHelpful","R2VOQ9WPRH0ID","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's be honest ... the old Minolta 50mm f/1.7 AF is the cheapest fast prime you can find for the Alpha lens mount for Minolta and Sony cameras. The reason so many people buy this lens is because it's cheap. You either don't have the budget to spend on a faster 50mm f/1.4 lens or you want a cheap lens that is essentially ""disposable"" for work in a dangerous situation ... or both.I wanted a cheap but fast lens that would work on either my Sony A99 or A77II for use around muddy sports events (motocross and rallycross) or sports where I'm close enough to possibly get hit by athletes (court side high school basketball or roller derby). I braced myself for terrible CA and purple fringing when shooting wide open at f/1.7 and I expected this lens to be painfully soft since it's so stinking cheap.Much to my surprise, the old Minolta 50mm f/1.7 AF is extremely sharp wide open at f/1.7 (not as sharp as my Sony Zeiss 85mm f/1.4 wide open, but that's comparing a $1,600 lens to a $40 lens ... of course the more expensive lens is sharper). There is a fair amount of CA and purple fringing around high contrast edges, but those optical flaws are easy to fix in Photoshop or Lightroom. I've also found that I like to increase the contrast in Photoshop when I'm using this lens for sports (although the weaker contrast looks fine when shooting portraits because most people don't want contrasty, razor-sharp skin pores and wrinkles).This ""throw away"" Minolta 50mm f/1.7 AF has become my favorite lens to use on the A99 when shooting portraits indoors where I'm working closer to the subject. I sometimes use this with the A77II as well because the crop factor on the A77II makes this 50mm lens more like a 75mm lens (although it still has the 50mm optical characteristic of ""rounding"" faces ... it just crops the image closer).I also picked up an old Tokina 80-200mm f/2.8 AT-X AF lens that is my ""disposable"" cheap telephoto lens if I need more telephoto reach when shooting sports close to athletes/danger/mud. That lens is optically similar in terms of CA and purple fringing and is a good choice if you need a ""throw away"" lens with more reach than this cheap 50mm lens.Bottom line, the Minolta 50mm f/1.7 AF isn't the greatest lens available for the A-mount, but it does deliver the best value for the money. I can't think of another fast autofocus lens for the A-mount that performs this well that you can buy used for between $25 and $60 depending on condition.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U96BCNRLJLJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EHMGBA#wasThisHelpful","R2U96BCNRLJLJ5","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a caffeine addict and so is my wife, but the older we get the pickier we've become about the coffee we drink. That said, we only spend as little as possible on coffee because we have two kids, a dog and many bills to pay every month. As much as we love good coffee, we love having enough money to live comfortably more. The Natura Coffee Monteverde Costa Rican Coffee is a ""little luxury"" that isn't too expensive for our monthly budget and it's affordable enough that we don't feel guilty indulging is good coffee.Before switching to this coffee, we previously purchased Eight O'Clock Colombian Peaks Ground Coffee or Gevalia Kaffe Columbian Ground Coffee (both are usually priced between $0.55-$0.65 per ounce). Those coffees are both good and we loved them more than Folgers or Taster's Choice (which are more bitter and have a mild ""artificial"" taste), but Eight O'Clock and Gevalia didn't have the same flavor as a good cup for coffee from a quality coffee shop.I decided to try something different and ordered the Natura Coffee Monteverde Costa Rican Ground Coffee (which is slightly more expensive at about $0.80-$0.91 per ounce depending on the current price). The first thing I noticed about the Monteverde coffee is that the aroma of the ground coffee is stronger and smells more like freshly ground coffee. The brewed coffee is likewise more fragrant and the taste is ""rich"" with a hint of ""chocolate"" behind the main flavor of the coffee. It's not like hot cocoa mixed with coffee ... it's very subtle, but it's there.I'd love it if this coffee was a little less expensive, but as long as it doesn't get any pricier then my wife and I will continue buying this coffee for a long, long time.

"Let me start out by saying that I've owned, carried and used many, MANY knives over the decades. That said, although I know more about knives than the average person, I don't claim to be an expert. What I can tell you about is my personal experience with the Schrade SCH501 that I purchased to replace my (more expensive) Kershaw Thermite as my everyday carry (EDC) pocket knife.I enjoyed the Kershaw Thermite because the blade was between 3 and 4 inches and the G10 handle was between 4.5 and 5 inches (my favorite blade/handle size for an EDC pocket folder). Unfortunately, that particular Kershaw knife uses the Kershaw ""SpeedSafe"" assisted opening mechanism to help you flip the blade out when you need to use the knife. The problem with SpeedSafe knives is that the torsion bar component of the SpeedSafe mechanism is prone to breakage and when the torsion bar broke on my Thermite the knife was practically useless as a pocket knife.I started looking around for another knife with a similar size and shape to the Thermite and discovered this SCH501. There are several things that I like about this Schrade knife over my old Kershaw Thermite knife:-- The SCH501 uses 9Cr18MoV blade steel which is slightly better than the cheaper 8Cr13MoV steel used on my old Kershaw knife. The steels are very similar, but the 9Cr18MoV is a slightly harder steel with slightly better edge retention. What that meant in the real world is I didn't have to resharpen this SCH501 knife as often as I had to resharpen my Thermite after heavy use.-- The manual flipper and dual thumb stud folding mechanism is more durable than the delicate SpeedSafe mechanism and its flawed torsion bar design.-- The dual G10 handle slabs on this Schrade linerlock fill my hand better than the single G10 slab on the Thermite's framelock design ... meaning it is more secure in my hand when I'm applying pressure to cut thick material.There are only a couple of things I don't love about the Schrade SCH501: First, the jimping (textured pattern on the front and back edges of the G10 scales) is too rough and needs to be sanded down more. If you grip the knife firmly without gloves and you use it for a while you'll start to feel ""hot spots"" on your fingers and palm where the sharp edges of the jimping digs into your skin. The jimping also frequently catches on the edge of my jeans pocket and is starting to rip up my jeans a bit in those spots.Also, the pocket clip is not reversible for ""tip up"" carry, which is my preferred way to carry a pocket knife. It would have been nice if Schrade added extra holes on the clip-side of the knife so users could move the pocket clip for tip up carry. One last issue is that the ""slot"" that serves as a lanyard hole is too narrow for a standard 550 Paracord lanyard ... but that is really only an issue for me if I'm carrying a pocket knife in the tip up position, and since this is tip down carry I don't personally care about the lanyard hole.Bottom line, although the Schrade SCH501 isn't perfect, I like this knife better than my old Kershaw Thermite and I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a reasonably large EDC folding knife with a budget price tag. This is a nice, durable pocket knife that holds an edge well and doesn't require constant resharpening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE19XZAQEX2T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5T7QSC#wasThisHelpful","RE19XZAQEX2T4","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The LeapTV Dance and Learn video game is one of the first games available for LeapFrog's new LeapTV system. LeapFrog has been making educational video games (and game systems) for children for many years and the Dance and Learn game hits all the right check marks on the list of what makes a good LeapFrog reading game:-- Basic alphabet ... check.-- Phonics and basic construction of words ... check.-- Vocabulary ... check.-- Getting kids off their butts and motivated to learn ... check.That last item on the check list is largely made possible thanks to the fact that the new LeapTV console and controller work amazingly well. It's almost like LeapFrog combined the ability to track player movement from the Xbox Kinect with the physical, gyroscopic controller for the Nintendo Wii.It took my kids a couple of tries before they got the hang of it, but the control interface is so simple that it was easy for them to get going once they understood how the console's camera, controller and the game worked together. I only had to help my son with the game the first two times that he played, after that he could keep up with his older sister.My 8-year-old daughter understands that this is a game designed to help kids learn and not ""just"" a dance game, but she and my 5-year-old son love coming home from school so they can start dancing and jumping around with this game. This has been great fun for the winter season when it's too cold to go outside after school.As other reviewers have said, one of the main things about the LeapTV system and this game is that it requires use the of console's camera. You need to have the console setup in a room with plenty of light (multiple windows are good) and it's very difficult (or nearly impossible) to play this game if the camera can't see the player due to poor lighting.The bottom line is that the LeapTV Dance and Learn video game is a great addition to the LeapTV console and is a fun way to get young kids to be physically active and work on basic reading skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19R6WT4XPOIAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6NGS#wasThisHelpful","R19R6WT4XPOIAD","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The BenQ HC1200 is one of the best 1080p home theater projectors currently on the market (early 2015). The color accuracy is beyond reproach and, although I haven't owned it long enough to confirm, the advertised resistance to color fading over time are some of the major reasons to buy this projector over other full HD (1080p) projectors.I speak from experience when I say that color fading is a BIG problem with home theater projectors because they are typically used for longer periods of time and more frequently than typical business projectors. Even after replacing bulbs in old home theater projectors, I've noticed bad color reproduction, so if BenQ's claim is true that the HC1200 doesn't suffer from typical color fading then that makes it worth a higher than average price.Contrast from the BenQ HC1200 is noticeably better than other home theater projectors I've used: blacks are ""blacker"" and the brights are brighter while still retaining detail in the highlights and shadows of the movie or TV you're watching.As with all home theater projectors I've used, the HC1200 benefits from being projected on a quality screen surface rather than simply a wall that has been painted white. My experience with this projector is that it works very well with my projection screen, but your results may vary if you're projecting directly onto a wall.Overall, if you're looking for a high-quality 1080p home theater projector from your basement theater setup then the BenQ HC1200 is a fantastic choice.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUEDVGF3E0AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZC6ZAI#wasThisHelpful","R1DUEDVGF3E0AH","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been hesitant to move to a newer iPhone because I've been perfectly happy with my ""old"" iPhone 4S smartphone. That said, I recently started having battery life problems with my iPhone where the battery would quickly drop from full charge to almost no charge in just a couple of hours with minimal 3G or WiFi use.I realized the battery inside the iPhone was starting to die and when I looked into getting a new phone from work it was obvious that it would be more trouble than it was worth or I might even end up with a worse phone than my current iPhone 4S. After doing some quick research online I figured out that replacing the battery was equally troublesome, and that the best course of action was to get an external battery pack case for my iPhone.The uNu Power DX PLUS has one of the highest battery capacity ratings of any case for the iPhone 4S, and my wife has had an excellent experience with her uNu case for her newer iPhone 5, so I decided to take a chance and buy this case.This uNu case has worked flawlessly and now my iPhone frequently lasts 2-4 days without needing to be plugged in for a charge. In fact, now my only problem is that sometimes I go for days without remembering that I need to plug in my iPhone to charge it at some point. This is MUCH better than having my phone die after only a couple of hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Z5I7126ET25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UXR954#wasThisHelpful","R18Z5I7126ET25","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom are the 1-2 punch for photographic editing. There are other options out there, but whether we like it or not, most of us keep coming back to Adobe sooner or later for one reason or another.When Adobe switched to the ""Creative Cloud"" online subscription system (where users have to pay monthly or yearly for a subscription to use Photoshop and Lightroom) I joined many consumers in switching to other applications rather than migrating to Photoshop CC. My concerns were justified when Adobe's Creative Cloud system was hacked within the first 12 months and all the credit card numbers for all subscribers were compromised. That security breach alone guarantees that I will NEVER subscribe to Creative Cloud by providing my credit card information to Adobe.That being said, Creative Cloud does offer several unique features you won't find in the boxed version of Photoshop CS6 or competitive products. When I saw that Adobe was offering 12-month prepaid memberships to Creative Cloud (so you don't have to provide your credit card information to Adobe) I decided I'd give Creative Cloud a try.The latest incarnations of Photoshop CC and Lightroom are the most versatile versions of these programs to date and they work together very nicely. I know many photographers who do all there editing in Lightroom and never even use Photoshop anymore, but I'm old school and prefer working in Photoshop and almost never use Lightroom.I won't go through the 100s of features in these applications (there are many sites and videos online if you're curious about how to use these programs) but I will say this is the best way to use Creative Cloud with the least risk to your personal credit information.I'm still not happy that Adobe has switched to the subscription method instead of just letting people buy the software once and be done, but if you need to use Photoshop and Lightroom then a prepaid 12-month subscription card is the way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VA01LA2ZFNXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O66FYU0#wasThisHelpful","R3VA01LA2ZFNXS","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a number of wired gaming headsets over the years from Turtle Beach as well as other companies like Logitech, but I've avoided wireless gaming headsets prior to this because I've read many complaints online about older wireless gaming headsets. Namely, the audio tends to ""drop out"" for a few seconds at random times when the older wireless headsets lose their connection. Still, I wanted to give the Turtle Beach Ear Force Stealth 500X a try.I hoped to avoid trouble with the Stealth 500X, so I connected the included transmitter and the headset to my Windows 8.1 desktop and installed the latest firmware from the Turtle Beach website. After the firmware update I tried connecting the 500X transmitter to my Xbox to get started testing.One good thing about the 500X is that the wireless headset and the transmitter are already paired, so you won't have to go through the a frustrating process of pressing extra buttons and typing in a Bluetooth pairing code just to get the transmitter and the headset to start working.Audio quality is pretty good both in terms of the earphone speakers and the quality of the audio picked up by the microphone. Games sounded as clear to me using the 500X as they did when I was using a wired headset, and other gamers heard my voice loud and clear. My only major complaint in terms of audio is that -- as a few other reviewers have mentioned -- the maximum volume setting on the Stealth 500X isn't as high as the Logitech headset that I typically use. I usually have the Stealth 500X set at or near maximum volume just so I can hear the more subtle sound effects in a game ... and I have pretty sensitive hearing.One other item of note is that the ""surround sound"" modes on the Stealth 500X feel a little more like a marketing gimmick than a useful audio setting. I felt like the standard stereo mode gave the best audio quality.Speaking of ""surround sound"" ... the earphone cups don't do a very good job of isolating sound from spilling outside the headphones. In other words, if I'm sitting on the couch using the Stealth 500X and my wife is sitting next to me she will still be able to hear much of what is going on. It's not that the headphones are too loud, it's as if they are projecting sound both toward the person wearing the heaset and out around the user. That sort of defeats the purpose of wearing headphones.The headset itself was pretty comfortable on my head and ears, although I found the microphone moves out of position a little too easy.I never had the wireless single drop off during use, but if I started using it after it had been idle for a day or two sometimes the microphone wouldn't work unless I reset the transmitter and the headset. It's not a huge problem as long as you remember to do it before you start playing.The bottom line is that this wireless headset is ""pretty good"" but I don't know that I would be willing to pay the full retail price of around $230 for this headset given all the ""minor annoyances"" it has. Turtle Beach might be able to fix a few issues via firmware, but I wouldn't buy this at full MSRP unless you absolutely cannot stand using a better headset because of the wired connection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33GVE6QJY7COZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQACMM#wasThisHelpful","R33GVE6QJY7COZ","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Canon Pixma MG5620 is an all-in-one printer with scanner, copier and printer capabilities (no fax). The main headline here is that this printer uses Wi-Fi to your home network, so any device (PC, Mac, tablet or smartphone) can print documents or photos to your printer.Since it's from the team at Canon and part of the ""Pixma"" line, photo quality is a priority. This will make borderless photo prints up to 8.5 x 11 inches on a variety of photo papers. There is a typo in the description of the ""Print"" specifications on the Amazon product page that claims this printer can handle larger paper sizes like 11 inches x 17 inches and 13 inches x 19 inches, but that is an error on the Amazon page.Wireless printing is relatively easy to setup, but I will caution Mac OS and iOS users that the folks at Apple have a hard time getting any of their devices to play nice with printers. I usually have to restart my wife's MacBook Air or my iPhone if I want to print something or the print job will not be sent to the printer. I have ZERO problems using PCs or Android devices with this printer ... so it's a problem with Apple, not Canon.The photo quality coming out of this printer is fantastic. Unless you are very picky about your prints you'll have a hard time seeing a difference in photo quality when comparing the prints from this printer to prints from a photo lab.My only complaint about this printer is that the ink tanks are too small considering that this is being aimed at people who want to print photos. Photos (particularly borderless photos) consume a massive amount of ink and if you print a large number of photos that use the same color then you'll quickly run out of ink in one or more of the ink tanks/cartridges.For example, when I printed some photos from a beach vacation with lots of blue skies and blue water the cyan ink cartridge ran out. When I printed a bunch of night shots with black skies the regular black and pigment black inks ran low. The size of the ink tanks wouldn't be a big deal if this was a work printer and you just print a bunch of pages of black text, but if you're primary purpose for this printer is to make photographs then you better buy a bunch of spare ink cartridges.If Canon made this same printer with tanks that are twice as large then I would have given it 5 stars. Canon does offer ""XL"" ink cartridges that are larger, but they don't hold much more ink than the standard cartridges. We really need tanks that are twice as large as the ""XL"" cartridges for photo printing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VH1OCXJ459/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGSC0#wasThisHelpful","R29VH1OCXJ459","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago I started shaving during my morning shower (while I'm still in the shower) rather than shaving before or after my shower. The biggest problem I ran into was dealing with shaving cream.Most shaving creams don't respond well in a shot shower and either wash off before you've finished the shave or just short of fall off your face because of the humidity in the shower. I started using body wash instead of shaving cream to shave in the shower, but the problem with that is that most body washes dry your skin and I was left with very, VERY dry skin after every shave.I decided to try out Nivea for Men Maximum Hydration 3-in-1 Body Wash because the ""hydration"" part of the name made me think it might be just what I needed.As a matter of fact, it was. This body wash works just like any other body wash / liquid soap but it has significantly more ingredients for hydrating your skin ... making it ideal for someone like me who wants to use body wash to shave in the shower.Since I switched to this body wash I've noticed that my face is much smoother and my skin is softer after each shave ... a big difference from the dry, flaky skin I had after shaving with regular body wash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV6E8Y1BFNE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0KQ01O#wasThisHelpful","RQV6E8Y1BFNE3","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sterling Silver Twist Medallion is a very attractive pendant made of polished sterling silver and looks a bit like a crescent moon from a distance.The real beauty of this pendant is only visible when you get closer and can see the twists and imperfections of the polished metal as it bends up and around the hole for the chain. It's a simple design but very lovely.My only complaint about this necklace is that it's a very nice pendant and a very cheap chain. The pendant is quite stunning in person but the chain is short and thin and looks and feels cheap ... which detracts from the pendant.Overall, I highly recommend this pendant as a gift for women who like silver and don't like gaudy, over-the-top jewelry ... but purchase a nicer (and longer) chain to go with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3OPBOXZ0NXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGQ70IM#wasThisHelpful","R2M3OPBOXZ0NXM","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Turtle Beach Ear Force stereo gaming headset for the Marvel Super Heroes video game is a pretty great gaming headset.This headset works for gaming consoles or for desktop PC's thanks to the included adapter. Each of the headphone cups has a removable panel that can be customized with a different logo panel. I liked the default panel (the one with the various Marvel super hero logos) but I also suppose you could put any picture there as long as the image is cut to fit.Audio performance is pretty good; there is a wide range of sound from highs to lows and the padded cushions are comfortable and keep your ears isolated for quality audio.The adjustable microphone is decent, and people playing games with me had no complaints about my voice from the mic. That said, the adjustable microphone arm (the flexible wire that holds the mic in position next to your mouth) isn't as firm as I would like it to be. I had to readjust the position of the microphone more often than I do with my Logitech G230 headset.Overall, this is a great gaming headset and is ideal for gamers with modern consoles or PCs if you're into Marvel comics. The microphone arm issue isn't the end of the world, but might be annoying if you are used to headsets with really firm microphone placement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10QGRI6GTLVKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVQQJBW#wasThisHelpful","R10QGRI6GTLVKB","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mega Bloks is the Canadian toy company that makes the best Lego-compatible building block sets. Mega Bloks also manages to get some of the best merchandising deals with game developers (Halo, World of Warcraft, and Call of Duty are also available Mega Bloks sets).The Mega Bloks Assassin's Creed Gunboat Takeover is a nice set that comes with everything you need to build the pirate ship ""Takeover"" and includes four action figures with accessories. I actually call the figures in Mega Bloks sets ""action figures"" because they look more anatomically correct (at least in terms of having knees and elbows) and they have more points of articulation so you can pose them in different spots on the ship and they look natural instead of just looking like squarish Lego figures stuck on a toy.My only complaint about this set is that the Gunboat Takeover itself is not to scale with the included action figures. It's a nice set, but the boat needs to be bigger based on the size of the figures. When you load all four figures on the boat it looks more like the ""dingy"" Takeover rather than a fierce pirate ship.This set is definitely designed for teenage or more adult Assassin's Creed fans in that several stages of the build are somewhat complex and the finished ship is somewhat fragile because of the slender mast and sail rigging.That said, if you are looking for a cool pirate ship and don't want to spend the INSANE $300 or more that Lego charges for its pirate ship sets then the Mega Bloks Assassin's Creed Gunboat Takeover is a great choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34YLY5BUKZOI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MY3T30O#wasThisHelpful","R34YLY5BUKZOI8","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Corel PaintShop Pro side-by-side with Adobe Photoshop for almost a decade and the number of reasons to use PaintShop Pro just keep adding up with every new version.For starters, the overwhelming majority of photographers will discover that PaintShop Pro X7 can do more than Adobe Photoshop Elements and ""almost"" everything that Photoshop CS6/Photoshop CC can do.People who aren't familiar with Photoshop will be pleased to know that the user interface in Corel PaintShop Pro X7 is MUCH easier to understand without the need for a training course. The interface is simply very intuitive.There are two headaches that you will run into if you are someone who used Photoshop and has decided to move to PaintShop Pro because you don't want to ""rent"" your software from Adobe's Creative Cloud. First, as previously mentioned, the interface is very different from Photoshop so if you're used to Photoshop it will take time to train your brain. Yes, PaintShop Pro is very intuitive, but if your brain got used to Adobe's weird way of doing things it will take time to ""unlearn what you have learned.""Second, PaintShop Pro X7 has a very basic (almost useless) RAW editor build in. If you're used to ACR in Photoshop or Lightroom then the RAW editor in PaintShop Pro X7 is pretty terrible. This is all the more frustrating because Corel has an AMAZING software program for RAW editing called ""AfterShot Pro"" which is better than ACR or Lightroom in my opinion.If anyone from Corel is reading this, you need to delete the current RAW editor built into PaintShop Pro and figure out a way to insert AfterShot Pro into PaintShop Pro the same way that ACR is built into Photoshop. This is the ONLY thing that keeps Corel's software from absolutely CRUSHING Photoshop ... at least for those users who aren't blindly loyal to Photoshop.As for the rest of PaintShop Pro, it's pretty great. Some image edits are MUCH faster in Corel PaintShop Pro and others are faster in Photoshop. I've personally found all the edits that I do on a regular are faster in PaintShop Pro except when editing RAW. Again, figure out a way to squeeze AfterShot Pro into PaintShop Pro and Adobe better watch its back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33KIJI46SAYSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYYMXB0#wasThisHelpful","R33KIJI46SAYSS","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am one of those people who usually dismiss fuel system additives as useless ""snake oil"" products that are just a waste of money. That said, I decided to give the 3M Complete Fuel System Cleaner a try because I read another review here on Amazon. The other reviewer mentioned his car had a rough idle and that a bottle of this cleaner stopped the problem (or at least stopped the rough idle).My 2008 Scion xB has been suffering from a rough idle for a couple of months now and after several trips to the dealer and an independent mechanic they said nothing was wrong.

"The Nerf Rebelle Rapid Red Blaster looked like a dream come true for my daughter who wanted a ""cool"" blaster for shooting me and her brother in the Nerf wars in our house. However, this little blaster has a couple of design flaws that spoil some of the fun.For starters, there are several unique design elements that make the Rebelle Rapid Red more appealing to young girls. Yes, it has light purple and red and pink colors, but there is more to it than that. The grip of the blaster is slightly smaller than the typical grips on Nerf blasters and this makes it MUCH easier for young girls to hold the blaster and shoot for prolonged periods of time without their hands getting tired or sore.On the flip side, this makes the Rebelle Rapid Red a little uncomfortable for adults to hold because the grip is too small for adult hands.Next on the list of unique features are the darts. Although the Rebelle Rapid Red can fire standard Nerf N-Strike Elite darts, this blaster includes six pink and black N-Strike darts and six ""message darts."" Your daughter can write short messages on the darts and then the words written on the darts are invisible until you put the darts into either the red semi-transparent ammo magazine or put the message dart into the included red decoder to see what message is written on the dart.The biggest design flaw with this blaster is that the ""jam door"" located on the top of the blaster sometimes pops open on its own. The jam door is there in case one or more darts get jammed inside the blaster -- you can open the blaster and clear the darts out -- but the jam door has a safety switch that prevents the blaster from firing when the door is open. So ... the jam door sometimes pops open on its own and when that happens the blaster won't fire.My daughter got really annoyed with the jam door problem because sometime she would jump out from behind a hiding place to shoot me or her brother during a Nerf war and suddenly her blaster wouldn't fire. That's a really lame design flaw. This problem can be avoided if you're careful and keep one hand near the jam door to keep it closed or use tape to keep it closed, but it's a problem I've never had on any other Nerf blaster.I probably would have given this blaster 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for the jam door issue. It's actually a pretty good blaster if it wasn't for the jam door popping open.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9AYMEL7GRRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INZO30M#wasThisHelpful","RX9AYMEL7GRRS","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cactus V6 wireless radio transceivers are relatively new to the market but are without a doubt the most versatile radio triggers on the market AND are still cheaper than many radio triggers that are less effective (including PocketWizards).What? How can I dare suggest that the Cactus V6 transceivers are better than PocketWizards? Because I've used almost every variety of PocketWizard made in the last 15 years ... and I've personally found these are easier to use and more reliable*. I put an asterisk by that last comment because the only shooting environment where I haven't tested the Cactus V6 is a professional sports event where there are dozens of other photojournalists using radio triggers at the same time.The main advantage of the Cactus V6 is that it works with a variety of TTL flash protocols so you can control the power output of wireless speedlights even if they come from different manufacturers or use different TTL standards. That's right, you can mix and match flashes from Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Metz, and others ... and the Cactus V6 controls them all as if they are part of the same flash system.The setup is a little complex at first because the V6 has to be told what flash has been connected (or you have to set it up so the V6 can ""learn"" what flash is connected on its own). However, once you've done the setup a couple of times you'll be able to setup the V6's MUCH faster.I particularly love the V6 system because I use a variety of cameras and flashes from different brands and the V6s communicate with every camera and every flash while giving me the same level of control that is only available with the PocketWizard MiniTT1, FlexTT5 and AC3 zone controller. Keep in mind that the PocketWizard products I mentioned above only give you TTL/ratio control with one type of TTL protocol (Nikon or Canon) and you cannot mix and match like with the Cactus V6.I use multiple V6 transceivers with Pentax, Sony, Olympus and Canon cameras and a mix of Canon, Pentax, and Metz flashes. These triggers give me amazing control over my off-camera lighting all through the V6 that is connected to my camera. I don't have to walk over to flashes or have my assistant change the flash settings ... I can setup everything in  advance and then control my lighting from behind the camera.As I mentioned, I personally found the V6 to be more reliable than the PocketWizards over extremely long distances. My PocketWizards sometimes failed to fire reliably beyond a distance of about 30-35 feet. The Cactus V6 has ALWAYS worked at distances of up to about 60 feet as long as I setup the V6s correctly. I've never used the V6 system beyond about 60 feet so it may work fine beyond that range but I've never tried it.Bottom line, this is a BEST radio trigger system currently on the market in terms of both flexibility and value for your money.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3YSLW4O8OO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYFPLDC#wasThisHelpful","RX3YSLW4O8OO5","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've shot with a wide variety of digital cameras since switching from film to digital almost 14 years ago. I shoot professionally and for my own personal satisfaction. The Sony RX1 is one of those few cameras that satisfies BOTH my professional and personal desires while I'm shooting.For starters, the RX1 is compact without being too small and the controls and menu interface are easy to use without being too simple for serious control. You might think it's easy to make a camera that does those things, but trust me, it isn't. Sony struck an almost perfect balance in terms of form and function.The biggest advantage to shooting with this little camera rather than another small ""mirrorless"" camera is image quality. There are many, many ways to define ""image quality"" but in this case I define it as images with the greatest possible detail (high ratio of actual image data rather than ""noise"") combined with an extraordinary dynamic range (detail recorded in both highlight and shadow) and a smooth transition between in-focus and out-of-focus areas (butter smooth bokeh that isn't harsh and distracting).I've shot with a number of full-frame cameras including the Sony A99, A7, A7r, Nikon D700, D600 and Canon 5D mkII. Those cameras are all great, but none of those other cameras (at least not with the lenses I used) deliver the same combination of rich details and insane amount of exposure latitude that comes from the RX1 and its 35mm Zeiss Sonnar T lens with f/2 aperture.I know most people interested in small full-frame cameras are turning to the Sony A7 series and interchangeable lenses, but if you are content with a 35mm lens then the RX1 will not disappoint. The price of the RX1 is higher than it should be now that there are more affordable full-frame cameras on the market, but it still delivers fantastic value when you consider the full frame sensor and the amazing 35mm lens. I've shot side-by-side with RX1 and the Sony A7 and Sony 35mm f/2.8 Zeiss Sonnar T FE ZA lens ... and I personally prefer the images from the RX1.I also own and shoot with several DSLRs and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras for work, but I enjoy shooting with the RX1 because it has everything I care about in a small package. I bought into cameras like the Olympus OM-D and PEN cameras and Sony NEX cameras because I wanted something small, but as soon as I added multiple lenses they where basically small DSLRs with less image quality. The RX1 is small but doesn't compromise on image quality. The Sony A7 series deliver similar quality, but as soon as you start adding lenses you might as well be using a DSLR kit. I'll stick with a full-frame camera that fits in my jacket pocket.Bottom line, if you are a serious (professional) photographer and can afford this camera (and you don't mind being ""stuck"" at 35mm) then there is no better camera than the RX1 in terms of delivering great results in a relatively small package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2ZVPDL5M83Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097CXFCC#wasThisHelpful","RT2ZVPDL5M83Y","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nerf N-Strike Elite Demolisher 2-in-1 is probably one of the best blasters currently available from Nerf. That said, it has a few flaws preventing it from being the ""perfect"" blaster to bring to a Nerf war.First, let's talk about the good. For starters, the Demolisher is a ""flywheel"" blaster (a battery-powered, fully automatic blaster) that uses standard N-Strike Elite darts but launches those darts over a greater distance than previous generation N-Strike Elite blasters. Most of my older Nerf blasters lose accuracy after about 30 feet and then the darts travel another 5 to 40 feet with much reduced accuracy. The Demolisher is still pretty accurate out to about 50-60 feet.On top of that (or rather ""below"" if you're looking at the blaster) there is a built-in ""rocket launcher"" that fires giant foam rockets over about the same distance. The rocket launcher is a pump-action design so you launch it by pulling the gray charging handle forward and pulling it back quickly. The blaster comes with two rockets: one stays in the launcher and the spare rocket is stored in an empty space in the shoulder stock.This is where we get into the design flaws. For starters, the stock isn't adjustable so it won't fit everyone. Second, the storage space for the spare rocket is located in a position where your face or body rubs up against it. The foam rocket has small foam ""stabilizer fins"" that help make the rocket more accurate after you launch it, but I'm worried the fins on the rockets will be damaged over time by being stored here.Next, the ammo magazine is actually a standard N-Strike Elite magazine but it has a ""bend"" at the bottom to make it curve like a ""banana clip"". Unfortunately, the capacity of the clip is very low (10 darts) because only the straight part of the clip holds darts ... the bent part is just empty plastic. If you aren't already aware, 10 darts is practically nothing for a fully automatic flywheel blaster. You will run out of ammo in a few seconds and have to either stop and change the magazine or reload. It would have made more sense for Nerf to include a drum magazine that can hold 35 darts. Heck, even the 18-dart drum would have been better.I also would have liked it if the rocket launcher had been removable. It's a self-contained pump-action blaster that is fused to the plastic of the main blaster. It would have been nice to make it a removable part so you can carry a smaller blaster if you don't want or need the rocket launcher.Bottom line, this is a cool blaster, but you have to worry about the rocket stored in the stock and you are constantly running out of ammo if you use the included banana clip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210GM4DM53RGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILD57WY#wasThisHelpful","R210GM4DM53RGE","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The BOOMco. Twisted Spinner Blaster is a large two-handed dart blaster that fires the new BOOMco. darts.What makes the BOOMco. blasters unique is the plastic darts which are tipped with a proprietary rubber-like substance that sticks to the provided targets (which are likewise coated in a proprietary substance) but the darts won't stick to anything else.These darts make it easy to know exactly if and where you hit the target because the dart sticks EXACTLY where it hits (as long as it hits the provided target or the ""shields"" attached to the blasters).That said, the plastic darts (which are really just fat plastic drinking straws that have been cut to length and tipped with the weird rubber sticky substance) are a little more painful when they hit at close range than the rubber-tipped foam N-Strike Elite darts from Nerf, and the BOOMco. blasters don't feel as good in the hands (or when shooting) as the Nerf N-Strike Elite blasters.The new BOOMco. Twisted Spinner Blaster looks pretty cool ... until you start using it. The big problem with this blaster is that the cocking mechanism (pulling the front handle back) raises the barrel out of firing position, so it's impossible to keep the blaster pointed straight at your target when you're rapidly firing the blaster (or ""slam firing"" the blaster by holding down the trigger and pulling back the charging handle every time you want to fire).The uniqueness of the BOOMco. blasters wears off quickly (once you realize the darts are just lame ""drinking straw darts"" on anything other than the provided targets/shields) and you miss the target because the charging handle moves the barrel. You end up asking yourself, ""Why not just use a Nerf blaster?""The Twisted Spinner Blaster is better than nothing if you don't have any blasters at all, but if you can't already tell ...

"I decided to try out this Samsung 23-inch LED LCD because my aging ASUS 23-inch display has horrible viewing angles (the colors look weird if I move my head to the left or right and the screen washed out too bright if the screen is tilted down and is too dim if it's tilted up  ... you have to view it from straight on).Viewing angles aren't a problem with this monitor because it uses IPS (in-plane switching) technology. You can do a Google search if you want all the technical details, but the bottom line is that a good IPS display looks the same whether you're looking at it from straight on or viewing it from the side. The colors and brightness/contrast don't change if you move your head around.You might be fine with a cheaper standard LCD if you're just browsing websites and typing in a Word document, but if you're watching Netflix movies on your PC or editing family photos then a nice IPS display like this makes a MASSIVE difference because you see how things are supposed to look ... not a messed up view with weird colors because the screen isn't perfectly positioned in front of your eyes.The only negative comment I have about this monitor is that I wish the stand had height adjustment so the monitor isn't so low on my desk.

"I've been a long time user of Eneloop batteries since Sanyo originally came out with them many years ago. Now that Panasonic has taken over the Eneloop line of batteries I was eager to see if these new batteries perform just as well as my old ones.For those of you who don't know, the Eneloop batteries come pre-charged and are among the best mass-produced Ni-MH rechargeable batteries you'll find anywhere. I use them in most of my electronics and I also use them in my camera flashes (the kind that mount in a DSLR hot shoe) because these batteries hold their charge for a long time and quickly recycle the capacitor in a camera flash so you can take the next shot quickly without needing to wait a long time for the flash to recharge.Eneloop batteries also have a longer lifespan than the other rechargeable batteries I've used over the years ... so you don't have to replace them as frequently. As many people know, rechargeable batteries lose capacity over time as they get recharged over and over again. I don't understand the chemical trickery that Sanyo (and now Panasonic) used with the Eneloop line, but these batteries retain their high capacity for longer than any other brand of rechargeable batteries I've owned.I used these new Panasonic Eneloop AA's in a variety of electronics (like the camera flashes I mentioned previously) and rechraged them several times with the old Sanyo Eneloop charger that I have. The batteries performed exactly as expected and  I didn't have any problems. I can't say for certain how long these batteries will last, but if they perform as well as my Sanyo Eneloop batteries then they'll last for many years to come.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYYTUG0YL0BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHKSN76#wasThisHelpful","R1KYYTUG0YL0BY","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Epson WorkForce WF-7620 is a BIG printer for your home office or office. It's not a giant office printer from the 1990s but it's bigger than a typical office inkjet printer because this bad boy can print on 13x19 wide format paper.This makes the WF-7620 ideal for small businesses that need to print posters or large presentation materials for clients. The photo quality is good, but if you're looking for a dedicated wide format photo printer then I'd suggest something like the Epson Stylus Photo R3000 or the Canon PIXMA PRO-1 professional photo printers.The WF-7620 is a great all-in-one printer, but those dedicated photo printers I mentioned above use inks specifically formulated for printing photos and their ink tanks are a bit larger. The problem I immediately noticed when printing photos with the WF-7620 is that the ink tanks run out FAST. The ink tanks/cartridges for the WF-7620 are barely larger than the ink cartridges for a standard 8.5x11 home office printer. That's fine if you only make 8.5x11 prints, but the only reason you would buy a printer as big as the WF-7620 is if you plan to print BIG (which consumes more ink) so why did Epson use such small ink cartridges?I like the fact that the WF-7620 has two paper trays for storing different paper types in the printer (like standard office paper in Tray 1 and photo paper in Tray 2). However, the printer drivers that I downloaded from the Epson website for both Windows and MacOS are terrible.The printer driver would pop up with an error message whenever I tried to print something from my Windows 8 PC or my Apple MacBook Air because the printer would get confused about which tray to use and what paper type was in each tray. I would have to walk over to the printer every time and press menu buttons on the printer to manually override the error message and get my project to print.Epson really needs to completely rework the printer drivers and make better ones available IMMEDIATELY.The print quality itself is fantastic and the large flatbed scanner and fax capabilities work perfectly. I didn't have any problems getting this printer connected to my Wi-Fi network, and my only complaints are about the small ink cartridges which will run out too quickly and the terrible printer drivers that make it impossible to use this printer without walking over to the printer and pressing buttons.If Epson fixes the driver issues then I'll give this printer 4 out of 5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZY3ACCFPG5AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGELG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZY3ACCFPG5AL","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously purchased an earlier generation 128GB OCZ Vertex 4 SSD so I was eager to upgrade with the newest 240GB Vertex 460 series when I had the chance.While the 128GB capacity of most budget SSDs is enough for a Windows boot drive and most applications, you'll quickly run out of space if you're storing all your images,family videos, or game installation files on your C-drive. Granted, a 240GB SSD isn't as much storage capacity as a modern 1TB or 2TB hard drive, but 240GB is enough for most users who don't have massive libraries of high-resolution images or a Steam library with several dozen games that you play regularly.This SSD works fine for desktop owners or ""most"" laptop users, but some of the ""Ultrabook"" style thin-and-light laptops made in recent years require a smaller ""mSATA"" SSD because a standard 2.5-inch SATA drive like this one won't fit inside. Be sure to check the specs for your laptop (or contact the manufacturer) to see if your laptop uses a standard SATA drive or a smaller mSATA (or another form factor SSD).Boot times into Windows 8 are marginally faster with this drive than with the older Vertex 4, but it's really only noticeable if you break out a stopwatch. The main advantage of using this drive as far as I'm concerned is that it has a higher capacity than my old 128GB drive.I never had any issues with the older Vertex 4 and I don't anticipate any problems with the new Vertex 460, but OCZ has an okay reputation for customer service should I have a problem.Overall, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2C49SRQP058/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZR4EEE#wasThisHelpful","R3O2C49SRQP058","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned and used many knives over the decades before I discovered the Tops Knives company here in the good old USA. Tops makes outstanding knives with some of the best quality and attention to detail that I've ever seen. I purchased the Tops Knives Interceptor (331 model) because I previously purchased the smaller Tops Knives Tom Brown Scout and it quickly became my favorite EDC (every day carry) knife.I suggest reading my review of the Tom Brown Scout knife if you're interested in a slightly smaller knife than the Interceptor with close to the same design and build quality. Now let's focus on the Interceptor.The Interceptor is available with several different blade styles (blade geometries) but I picked the 331 spear point model because it's the closest to the Tom Brown Scout ... just longer with a thicker blade material (for the times I might need a larger blade) and it has thicker handle slabs.Speaking of the handle, I love this handle style on Tops Knives. Tops has several different knives with handles like this and I own every one of them because I think this is the most comfortable handle design in the world for smaller blades (less than 6 inches of actual blade). The linen-wrapped Micarta handles feel amazing in my hands and I can squeeze this grip as tight as possible and there are no ""hot spots"" where the grip pattern hurts my hand. It's almost like the grip seamlessly melts into my hand.The blade is perfect for bushcraft or general use with an area of jimping on the thumb ramp to help you hold the knife securely if the knife gets wet or bloody when processing game. There are also holes near the back of the blade to help you secure the knife to a stick/branch if you need to make a survival spear.There are only two reasons that I gave this knife 4 stars instead of 5.First, my Interceptor didn't come as sharp from the factory as my other two Tops Knives. The edge on my Interceptor could barely cut paper straight out of the box but my other Tops Knives were almost ""shaving sharp"" and cut through paper like it wasn't there straight out of the box.Second, the Kydex sheath that came with my Interceptor wasn't fitted properly so the knife falls straight out of the sheath if you hold it upside down and lightly shake the sheath. My other Tops Knives with Kydex sheaths stay secure in their sheaths and won't come out unless you pull the knife out.Neither of those issues are deal-breakers since I can sharpen the knife and I can heat up the Kydex with a heat gun and mold it to give the Interceptor a more secure fit.Bottom line, I would highly recommend this knife to anyone who wants a medium-sized camping knife or a large EDC fixed blade for military or police use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8EKLWX96NI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6CORU#wasThisHelpful","RL8EKLWX96NI2","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a hardcore outdoorsman but I do like being in the outdoors and I don't mind camping on my own or with another adult. However, as a parent, I discovered that camping is a COMPLETELY different experience with two little kids. Kids need more space (at least if Mom and Dad want to get any sleep) and kids have a natural tendency to complain about any lack of comfort.That's where this Wenzel Klondike tent really comes into a league of its own.This is technically an 8-person tent but I'd say it fits six people ""comfortably"" and fits a ""family of four"" with plenty of room to move around and have some of your stuff inside the tent. The main tent room is large enough for a queen-sized inflatable mattress (something my wife insists upon nowadays) and the front room is big enough for our son and daughter to have their sleeping bags, clothes and lanterns inside the tent.Setup was remarkably easy. I've never setup a multi-room tent like this before and it took minimal effort and I probably could have done it without reading the instructions (although I always do ... to avoid unpleasant surprises at the camp site). My wife and I had the entire tent setup in less than 10 minutes the first time (we can probably put the tent up in less than 5 minutes now that we know the process). Tearing down the tent and packing it back up takes a bit more time and effort (as usual) because you have to fold/roll everything back into the bags, but the process is just as easy in reverse.All the screened-in openings have privacy flaps (including the door flap between the main room and the front room). We only had two problems during the camping trip:1) Since the tent is so big sometimes people forgot it was a tent and left the front flaps open so more bugs got inside than usual. (Both the kids and Mom were guilty of that one).2) Every child at the camp site wanted to come play inside our tent. This isn't such a terrible thing when you have kids who want to socialize and play with new friends ... but trying to manage a constant stream of kids wanting to play inside your family's tent gets old after about a day.Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this tent. If you're in the market for a large tent for a family camping trip then you'll be hard-pressed to find a better tent at a better price than this.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38D8AASVQ4GEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PB2HPS#wasThisHelpful","R38D8AASVQ4GEZ","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wanted to have a freshly stocked first aid kit in the house for my kids' babysitter since my son and daughter play rough and regularly end up with scrapes and bumps that need mending.Although this is from the ""PhysiciansCare"" brand I wouldn't say this is a true ""physician's"" first aid kit since it's not setup to handle massive bleeding or more serious life-threatening wounds. That said, this kit comes with a pair of scissors, tweezers, a couple of larger trauma bandages, a role of medical tape, a bunch of generic small bandages (band-aids), as well as several packages of antibiotic ointment, antiseptic wipes and burn cream. You also get two pairs of rubber gloves, one cold pack and one container of eyewash.In short, this is enough for typical first aid needs around the house but probably isn't enough for serious accidents out in the field and is not a ""trauma kit"" for camping/emergency survival.

"I needed a nice folder with a medium-sized blade back in 1996 and purchased this Schrade Old Timer at a Walmart store.

"The ADX Handheld Mini CREE LED flashlight/lantern is a basic key chain LED flashlight with a ""lantern"" feature to spread the light over a wider area.My biggest complaint about this flashlight is that it uses a CR 2032 coin-style battery rather than a standard AA or AAA battery. Yes, a standard battery usually means the flashlight has to be longer, but frankly I'd rather have a slightly longer flashlight that uses a standard battery than get stuck during a power outage without a replacement battery.If you overlook the coin-style battery then my next complaint is the ""lantern"" feature which feels more like a gimmick than a really useful feature. Sure, when you move the front of the flashlight into the lantern position it spreads the light out but the light output is so weak that you aren't really getting the amount of light you expect from a small lantern.My last issue with this flashlight is the keyring attachment. The clip itself is pretty solid and works exactly like you want it to, but the circular ring that connects the clip to the flashlight is just a thin wire ring and it's easy to pull apart. I actually pulled the flashlight off the ring by accident because the wire pulled apart.Bottom line, this flashlight works but it's not ideal because of the non-standard battery, weak lantern feature, and weak wire ring connecting the flashlight to the key chain clip.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AP35CTT0AGPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN1LOPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1AP35CTT0AGPD","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate a few weeks ago mainly to help me record live capture of what is on my computer screen so I can make videos to train people how to use various applications on a PC. Pinnacle Studio has been wonderful for that purpose but it is able to do so much more.For starters, it simplifies the process of importing video from my cameras and my iPhone as soon as I connect them to my computer. From there, it's pretty easy to do quick edits and export the finished video to YouTube or burn a DVD. Of course, if you want to do more complex, ""serious"" editing then Pinnacle Studio has a bunch of 2D and 3D effects and filters you can apply to make your videos look extremely professional.The user interface is very straightforward -- if you've ever used a ""timeline"" style video editing application it should only take you a few minutes to figure out how to edit a basic video using this software.I didn't test the 4K capabilities of this software because I don't have a native 4K camera or a 4K monitor, but it's good to know that this software has the capability to edit video footage that has been shot at ""greater than 1080p resolution.""In short, I would recommend this software because it has a lot of great features and it's easy to use. I haven't found an easier application for recording live capture on my PC so this is great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R363Y7FE1E043T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6CLNCK#wasThisHelpful","R363Y7FE1E043T","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was eager to try out the Panavise PortaGrip Phone Holder with Windshield Mount for my car (a 2008 Scion XB) because I use my iPhone in my car all the time. My iPhone is my music player, my GPS, and I use it for hands-free calls. The problem is that I haven't found an in-car mount for my iPhone that I really like.I've tried several, but none of them have the flexibility or the mounting hardware that I need. I did recently purchase the iOttie HLCRIO102 One Touch Windshield Dashboard Universal Car Mount Holder for my wife's van and that iPhone holder has been wonderful in my wife's van. I was about to purchase one of those for my Scion when I saw the Panavise and decided to give it a try.The Panavise PortaGrip is very similar to the iOttie HLCRIO102 but the Panavise PortaGrip has two major flaws:1) The release isn't quite ""one touch"" like the iOttie holder, so I often had to fumble with the release buttons on the sides to get my phone out of the holder.2) The suction cup mount is essentially useless. I couldn't get this suction cup to stay mounted to any window or windscreen in my car or my wife's van. I don't know why it's called a ""windshield mount"" if it doesn't stay mounted to the windshield.Overall, I can't really recommend the Panavise PortaGrip because it doesn't really work as a ""windshield mount"" in either of my vehicles. If you want something like this then I'd recommend the iOttie HLCRIO102 One Touch Windshield Dashboard Universal Car Mount Holder instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K1GE0BV8OBLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO3HCSY#wasThisHelpful","R1K1GE0BV8OBLY","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Goal Zero Switch 8 is a basic and convenient USB rechargeable battery that fits in your purse, coat pocket, or bag and gives you an emergency power boost for your smartphone, tablet, e-reader, or other mobile devices that can be charged over USB.It's a little disingenuous to call it a ""solar recharger"" because this battery pack is only solar powered if you combine it with the Nomad 3.5 solar panel ... which is sold separately.That said, there are three things that I love about this charger:1) It's powered via USB input so you can plug it into any USB port on a PC or a USB-to-power outlet adapter to charge this battery pack/stick.2) The USB output is a good 5 Volt, 1 amp for a variety of devices, so you just need to bring your iPhone USB cable to connect the battery to your iPhone or iPad.3) You can ""daisy chain"" multiple batteries together for more power.Here is the bad part ... the battery capacity is very weak. A single stick is just 2200mAh (compared to many iPhone battery packs or battery cases that have a rating of ""at least"" 2350mAh. This means you need to get at least TWO of these Goal Zero batteries and daisy chain them together to get a really nice power boost.As a side note, I recently attended a business presentation where someone gave out similar USB battery sticks to everyone for free ... and that guy bought his battery sticks from some other website for $10 each ... so I don't think this particular battery offers a great value per dollar other than the fact you can daisy chain multiple batteries together.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C34LMHU3N6G7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009TPI82Y#wasThisHelpful","R1C34LMHU3N6G7","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Actiontec Dual-Band Wireless Network Extender is a well-built Wi-Fi externder for your home network and works with both Ethernet and COAX routers.This box actually includes both the WCB3000N Wi-Fi extender (the main reason you want to buy this device) and a ECB2500C Ethernet over COAX Adapter. I don't have any need for Ethernet over COAX so I only used the WCB3000N Wi-Fi Extender in my home.If you're a techie like me then it should only take you 10-20 minutes to add this device to your home network. My home has a mixture of MacOS, iOS, Android, Windows 7 and Windows 8 devices and they all recognize this device without any problems. Wi-Fi speed varies dramatically depending on network usage from my main PC that's wired directly to the router, but devices that used to be at the extreme edge of my home Wi-Fi network can now access the Wi-Fi signal with better speed (most of the time ... again, it depends on if my main PC is really hogging the network).As others have mentioned, the quick start instructions aren't the best, and you might not get much help from the Actiontec website so I recommend that non-techies just take some time and read the full manual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDU4I1UCQNWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF8ZRR8#wasThisHelpful","R2UDU4I1UCQNWN","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Corsair RM Series 550 Watt power supply unit is hands down the best PSU I've used ... ever. I've had higher wattage PSUs with removable cables but this 90Plus Gold-Certified PSU is a premium product with all the bells and whistles you need ... as long as you don't have a giant rig with multiple high-end graphics cards.For starters, the RM550 is built with high-end capacitors and transformers and a super quiet fan so you don't get the coil whine fan noise that is typical to MANY power supplies. If you are sensitive to high-pitched noises from electronics then this is the PSU to get.Second, like most high-end PSUs, the RM550 has removable/modular cables so you only need to use the cables needed for your rig and you don't have a bunch of extra cables filling up your PC.The last big thing is that this power supply is very energy efficient ... my rig actually consumes less power (according to a kill-a-watt plug-in meter) than the same rig with a cheaper 500W PSU.This brings me to the last issue: wattage. If you are a system builder or you're doing a DIY upgrade, be sure to know the power requirements for your components. I'm running a modern Core i5 desktop with three SSDs, a DVD drive, card reader, and a single upper-mid-range Nvidia graphics card for gaming. 550 Watts is plenty of power for my rig, but if I had a higher wattage Core i7 and two or more graphics cards then I'd probably need a higher wattage PSU.Bottom line, the RM550 is a GREAT desktop power supply and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TG3NVGJYWLSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB7UIO6#wasThisHelpful","R2TG3NVGJYWLSW","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is a rather limited photo editing and retouching application compared to something like Photoshop CS or Photoshop Elements, but it does a VERY good job at simplifying several rather complex editing tasks ... making it possible for amateurs to do very difficult retouching.For starters, many people would like to quickly remove blemishes or make themselves look thinner in photos, and PhotoDirector 5 makes it so easy to do those things I'm actually surprised they're so difficult to do well in Photoshop.The content-aware object removal tools make it easy to remove distracting objects from the backgrounds in photos, but like Photoshop and Photoshop Elements you have to be careful since the software can get confused by complex backgrounds.In short, if you just want to quickly edit your family photos and don't want to learn more complex photo editing techniques then PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is probably the right software for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NCZPS8E2UW7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2BA8U4#wasThisHelpful","R1NCZPS8E2UW7Q","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tylt Energy Power Case is a simple hard case for the iPhone 5 and 5s that also includes a rechargeable battery to extend the life of your iPhone while you're on the go.The 2350mAh battery capacity is enough to nearly double the battery life of the iPhone and the rubber-coated hard plastic case gives your iPhone some added protection in case you drop it. Of course, the added battery means it takes roughly twice as long to charge the phone if the case battery and the phone battery are both depleted, but that should be expected since you're adding another battery.My only two complaints about this case are that the pass-through is a little small for the volume buttons and mute switch on the side so it's harder to access those buttons if you have big fingers ... and the case increases both the size and weight of the iPhone.Granted, the size and weight increase aren't massive ... but if you already think the iPhone 5 is a big phone then you might want to pass on this case.As far as I'm concerned, the added protection and additional battery life make this case more than worth it.

"I upgraded from an older AMD Radeon 6850 graphics card (which was the loudest thing inside my PC) to this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 660 OC edition. The new card is significantly better than my old card -- I can see lighting and shadow details that I didn't even realize where in my games -- and it runs MUCH quieter.The ""Windforce"" heatsink and dual fan design keeps the GPU cool but the card remains relatively quiet even when the fans turn on high. This lack of noise combined with exceptional gaming performance is why I love this graphics card. Sure, I can still hear the fans working when I'm pushing a game at 1080p resolution with all the detail settings maxed out, but the fans aren't so loud that i can't hear my wife or kids calling my name from outside my office (that was a problem with my old Radeon card).Add to this the fact that the GTX 660 supports my 3D monitor (for the handful of games I might want to play in 3D) and the GTX 660 supports streaming games to the Nvidia Shield and this is simply a fantastic card.Keep in mind this is a dual-slot card because of the large cooling block so make sure you have two open slots on your motherboard/case. Space isn't too much of an issue -- I was able to fit this card inside a typical mini-tower without any problems -- just make sure you have at least a 500w power supply and you should be golden.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33UBOPYQ54V8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00942TK8I#wasThisHelpful","R33UBOPYQ54V8Z","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kaotiks Psycho-Plex track and car is a pretty neat RC car playset with a few minor issues that spoil the fun.This is a pretty entry-level rechargeable RC car with only forward and reverse controls (the car turns on the track only because the walls prevent the car from moving in a straight line). As a result, the car isn't much fun without the track since you can't turn it and move it around the environment.That said, when you're using the Kaotics car inside the Psycho-Plex track it's pretty cool because the walls keep the car moving around the track and the ramps let you do some cool jumps/tricks ... until the battery runs out.This brings me to my biggest complaint about the car: The capacity of the rechargeable battery is too low. My son and daughter run down a fully charged battery in less than 10 minutes ... meaning they have to stop playing after 7-8 minutes and recharge the car for at least a half hour!The lack of steering makes the car a little annoying since you can't turn it outside the track but the weak battery spoils the fun since the car usually stops working right when my kids really get into playing with it. As it is now, I'd say my kids spend more time waiting for the car to recharge than they spend playing with it.I also think the walls on the track need to be twice as tall so that the car doesn't fly off (and out of) the track so frequently during jumps off the ramp.Bottom line, this is an affordable RC car track with a fast little car that does cool tricks on the track ramps, but the play experience is hurt by the lack of steering control and the weak battery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FO9SCH7FJ4QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1EFHBI#wasThisHelpful","R3FO9SCH7FJ4QG","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That's really my only minor complaint about the Green Toys Rocket: I wish the astronauts had movable arms and legs. Sure, that would make the figures a little less durable and these toys are designed for kids as young as 2, but the astronauts are pretty boring compared to the cool rocket.In any case, my son loves this toy and I highly recommend it (and other Green Toys products) to any parent looking for a quality toy for young kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7SRCTU260QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPRLGVE#wasThisHelpful","RY7SRCTU260QR","AZ515FFZ7I2P7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ515FFZ7I2P7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Genius Wireless Energy Mouse is a nice wireless mouse that is useful for laptop users who want to take an external mouse on the road and it offers a little something extra with the ability to provide some power to your smartphone.First, let's start with the mouse. This is a basic wireless mouse with an optical sensor and a relatively high DPI (1200 DPI) setting which is good for high-resolution screens. If your PC has a low-resolution display then the cursor/pointer will move VERY when you move the mouse. Unfortunately, the DPI can't be changed for low-res screens but most modern desktop screens and laptops have 1080p screens nowadays.The bottom of the mouse it ""okay"" for mobile use but I would have liked to see bigger/wider glide feet on the bottom so the mouse could more easily slide over desktop or mouse pad surfaces. The micro-sized USB receiver is nice because it pops into a USB port on your laptop and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb ... so you can leave it plugged into your laptop when traveling.Now lets move onto the ""Powerbank"" function of this mouse. The Powerbank is rated at 2700mAh which means it's not particularly powerful. In simple terms, when my iPhone 4s was down to minimal battery power (red) I was only able to get the Energy Mouse's Powerbank to charge my iPhone up to around 50% (+/- 15%). The same goes for my ASUS MeMo Pad 10 FHD Android tablet.Bottom line, the Powerbank inside this mouse is just meant for ""topping off"" your smartphone or tablet or is meant to provide ""emergency power"" to your smartphone. It's not capable of completely recharging a device from almost zero battery power to full.

If I could, I'd wear tennis shoes to work and scrubs but I chose finance over medicine and that's that.These shoes are a little tough on my feet at first - but that's probably from all my running and other training I do - my feet are generally sore a few days a week when the monthly mileage creeps up over 70-80 miles, so I can't blame these shoes.I can say they are supple when broke in for a few days and the leather is equal to any good leather when polishing them.  I don't find my feet hot in these shoes at all, and I don't find any points that cause friction or pain.

"47....haven't seen a dr. for more than a cold since I left the Army at 22 years old.  Imagine my surprise when Kidney Stones hit me last month!Well, as this book (and my Dr.) pointed out...I was ""working hard"" at making Kidney stones!  How? oh...just being ""healthy!""  I got a Nutribullet....I stuffed Kale and Spinich in it....threw in all kinds of nuts....then added blueberries and razberries to cover the taste of the kale...then I added a scoop or two of protein powder....and I drank this ""healthy"" shake 2 times a day for months!  Oh sure...I dropped the pounds and thinned up considerably....but I NEVER realized that my ""shake"" consisted of 5 of the top 10 WORST things to eat for making kidney stones!  I mean...who talks about that?  (Kale, Spinich and Beet root are all tied for the number one offender spot in the book!)  Then throw in rapid weight loss, not enough water, eating too much additional protein, and loving tomato sauce....and I ""hit"" about NINE of the top 10 worst things you can do....every day/every week!  The book is SO full of knowledge!Never had anything so painful...NEVER want them again!  I read this entire book in 2 days WHILE on 3 pain meds they gave me to help pass them!  I have since gone back several time to several passages with highlighter and stick note ""tabs"" I made.  I have learned SO much.  The book is technical...but not too much....and it's SO complete.The restaurant guides and food lists are worth every penny - the entire book is.

"OK....I'm closer to 50 than 40...and this is WAY overkill for what I needed...but daughter in college really pushed for the wife and I to get this one - it's the same model in her college gym - where they have a room full of them for spinning classes.  She wants to use it in the summers when she comes home.My wife is 5'4"" and about 110-115....and I am 6'4"" and now down to around 260....down from 300 last year...and headed to around 225 I think.Here's what we did to make this ""work"" for us:1st - the seat.  We found a nice full size, dual spring ""comfort seat"" for $20 here on Amazon....(Sunlite Cloud 9) I noticed Walmart and Academy had the same/similar as well.  The seat on this bike as it comes is so awful it's hard to put into words...I've biked most of my life and even a bmx trick bike seat seems like I remember it being better than this.  Luckily, it's a fast and cheap fix.2nd - the handlebars.  Unless you enjoy looking at the ground in front of the bike....something has to be done.  Even with the seat at lowest position and bars at highest position - for my shorter wife - she couldn't look up at the TV on the wall for more than a minute without hurting her neck.  For me...it's impossible to see more than the front wheel without unnaturally craning my neck at an extreme angle...let alone even seeing the TV on the wall to watch it at all.  We found a U shaped bar - it actually came off a Pilates we no longer use...and it has become our ""raised bars"" - we hook it thru the bars and it raises them about 15"" or so....it also moves the grip spot back towards the seat - helpful if you are not trying to achieve the ""tour de france look""  lol.The good?  The bike is WHISPER quiet.  It's probably going to last decades as there is really nothing to go wrong....and it's built like a tank.  I average an half hour to an hour on it in the evenings and then I go do some other workout things.  My wife walks on her treadmill (in the same room) for an hour or so...then jumps on this bike for another half hour-ish.  It's become a nice staple in both our routines.  The daughter?  she does crazy stuff like spending 12 hours straight spinning for charities and stuff like that....so if she wants to throw on the original seat this summer...she can...but the handle mod just comes off and on simply....so she can spin all she wants....she has already tried to show us how to put spinning videos on the TV...but we just watch our TV shows and pedal away.We set the resistance to something more than  easy....and then we either turn up the resistance during the commercials or try to increase our speed to as fast as we can go during the commercials...to make it a great workout.  I know I am drenched by the time I get off it....and she's already sweating before she gets on it....but I know we end up doing a lot more laundry each week since we got this bike, lol.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRN1QIR49IQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CVU2HG#wasThisHelpful","R1BRN1QIR49IQQ","AHP46VAR2Z046","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHP46VAR2Z046?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"EDIT after a month:  lowered to 3 stars, I do like it.  If I didn't have the original Smart Carry experiences to compare it to...I might not do this.  The angle of the top of the pouch is too straight.  With the Smart Carry the top of the pouch angles down to the outside allowing for an easier draw.  Again...nothing terrible here...just not as good to me...I'm gonna go back to the Smart Carry for this particular set up as well.I've used the real Smart Carry's for close to 10 years - I think I have 6 or 7 for different set ups, wanted one in a hurry and this was Prime and I got to add next day shipping so I had it in a day - very nice, that.It's good.  The double elastic on the sides is interesting, that is one area that does get stretched out some in Charlie's original design...but usually long after I have duct-taped together the pouch after years of use.The pouch itself seems to be sewn in a similar fashion to the original as well.The biggest difference is funny - the Velcro is exactly backwards! lol.  I am constantly trying to put the wrong end across my back first!  Well, it has been around a decade 'going the other way' so I expect that's just my own habit.I've got a tub of holsters like so many.  I like IWB and OWB when my dress allows...but I have NEVER found a more comfortable way to carry - with the weight centered over both hips - as a Smart Carry, or of course, this one here.  It's really great for me in dress slacks (I wear fully pleated) and my shirt and tie during the work week.  It's fantastic with sweat pants and basketball shorts - which is 90% of what I wear when I'm not at work and not on the Harley or in a range training environment.Good deal, I'm happy with it, and love that Amazon got it to me so quick to meet the need I had.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AE9V6W5RYDMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUCGTYW#wasThisHelpful","R3AE9V6W5RYDMS","AHP46VAR2Z046","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHP46VAR2Z046?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The acting was great.But wonderful actors and exquisitely detailed scenes could not compensate for a wholly unbelievable plot. I was prepared for the plot to be a bit contrarian -- it suggests that the Earl of Oxford, not Shakespeare, wrote Shakespeare's plays.However, many of the characters are shown behaving in ways that contradict the historical records of that era -- and we have pretty good records of Elizabethan England.

"I have mixed feelings about the Common English Bible (CEB).It is definitely a new translation of the Bible -- there is little or no attempt to keep the King James Version phrasing  and structure that lingers in the NRSV (New Revised Standard Version) and the NIV (New International Version).I'm an Episcopalian -- one of the denominations that sponsored the CEB -- so I should have been delighted with this Bible, but I've found equally good and bad aspects of it.As someone who has read the KJV (King James Version), the RSV (Revised Standard Version), the NEB (New English Bible), the NRSV and the NIV, I found the CEB refreshing and gripping. I enjoy reading it.It appears to be intended as a theologically liberal rival to the popular conservative NIV in the niche for Bibles that are written in plain English for people who find more traditional language versions too difficult to read.I wish it were possible to give the CEB several ratings, rather than one rating. Regarding its goal of being easier to read, I'd give it a ""5."" It is written in a 7th grade vocabulary, according to some sources. It is not noticeably liberal, so conservative readers might also find it interesting.It is even easier to read than the NIV. It has a direct, forceful language that makes it ideal for teens, adults who are baffled by traditional Biblical language, new converts and people who want to read a Bible without having to stop and look up complex terms every fifteen minutes.But the CEB does have its problems, which is why I rated it as a ""3.""It's problems are especially apparent in the Psalms. The Psalms were used as liturgical poetry, and the CEB makes them sound -- well -- whiny and overly slangy, like posts on a totally self-absorbed teen's blog.I'm skeptical that the priests in the Second Temple chanted psalms that said: ""So kings, wise up!"" (CEB translation of Psalm 2:10)Another ""howler"" -- as I call these slang insertions -- Psalm 22:18: ""They divvy up my garments"" -- ""divvy up""???? -- please, that's just bad grammar. Also, I think 99 percent of most English language speakers would have understood: ""divide up"" just as well.Some of my other favorite ""howlers:""Judges 11:3: ""Worthless men gathered around Jepthah and became his posse."" His ""posse""? Are you kidding me? I think ""gang"" would have been far better -- that's the word that the NIV uses.The trouble with choices like ""divvy' and ""posse"" is not only their questionable grammar, but the fact that as slang terms, they'll go out of fashion in ten to twenty years.Then there is the well-publicized ""howler"" of changing references to Christ as the ""Son of Man,"" to the ""the Human One."" While that usage would fit translations of the Prophet Ezekiel, who is addressed in older translations as ""son of Man,"" by Christ's era, the title ""Son of Man"" had come to be understood as a Messianic title with very specific connotations. It think it is inaccurate to translate it as ""the Human One.""Another ""super howler"" -- 1 John 3:9: ""Those born from God don't practice sin because God's DNA remains in them.""""God's DNA""? Folks, DNA -- the DNA molecule -- the genetic blueprint in each of our cells that programs the kind of person we are from conception -- wasn't discovered in its true complexity until 1953. No way the first Epistle of John used that term or any term like it. The usual translation is ""God's seed"" -- or if you want to get really, really down to earth, perhaps ""God's sperm""? But not ""God's DNA.""The CEB also drops many traditional theological terms, such as ""repentance"" -- they are changed to phrases that may mean the same thing, but read awkwardly. For example ""repentance"" is translated as: ""changing their hearts and lives."" These changes will, as several media reviews noted, cut new Bible readers off from thousands of years of accepted theological terms such as ""repentance"" and ""sanctification.""On the other hand, the CEB does seem to translate the Pauline epistles more accurately than other Bibles I have read, following recent scholarship on what Paul was actually saying in the original Greek.. That is impressive.My final ""takeaway"" --  I will continue to rely on the NRSV as my primary Bible.and consult the CEB and  the NIV versions as my secondary choices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2447W257QWB8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609260155#wasThisHelpful","R2447W257QWB8U","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book raises serious questions about current Christian views of what constitutes orthodox theology, by examining how early Christians actually saw Jesus and what Jesus and St. Paul were calling for.The authors make a good case -- relying on modern scholarship -- that early Christians believed that Jesus died as a martyr for their new faith -- not as a sacrificial atonement -- and that Christians would receive salvation not only through faith in Jesus as the Son of God and the resurrected Christ, but also through the doing of good works imitating their founding martyr's life..They argue that  the Catholic and Protestant beliefs current today among many Christians -- the fall of man, salvation only through faith, Christ's sacrificial atonement on the cross -- and related doctrines -- are based on medieval Catholic and Reformation Protestant theologians having access only to poor translations of the Bible and being so separated in time and space from the original Christians that the theologians frequently misinterpreted key Gospel and Pauline texts.The authors are respectful of both conservative and liberal views of the Bible and theology, and base themselves solidly on modern scholarship that has learned far more about correct translations of Greek and Hebrew terms, and also far more about the Jewish and Greek cultures of Christ's era than was accessible to medieval Catholic and Reformation Protestant theologians.It's hard to summarize such a rich book in a few words. I would suggest that you read it yourself and see what you think. I'm still mulling over their arguments in my mind.

But it is apparently based on both the Biblical mention of Barabbas and a novel by a mid-20th century Swedish novelist, so it has great depth.Barabbas is depicted as a complex person, who endures great suffering on his way to determining his true path. The early Christians are not portrayed very favorably -- surprisingly, they somehow blame him for surviving when Jesus was executed, even though Barabbas had nothing to do with Pontius Pilate's decision to spare Barabbas..A movie that raises a lot of complex questions, it will intrigue both Christians and non-Christians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PLK2RK6R4UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00455KTGQ#wasThisHelpful","R23PLK2RK6R4UB","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed ""Dearest Rogue"" by Elizabeth Hoyt. I've been tired for some time of historical romances where both the hero and heroine are not only physically gorgeous, but have absolutely no disabilities or chronic health problems. It has been a real relief to see historical romances starting to portray their protagonists in a more realistic manner.I was very intrigued by the idea of a blind heroine and a hero who has to use a cane, and wondered how the author would handle it. I had never read any of Elizabeth Hoyt's books before.Lady Phoebe Batten is a vivacious, pretty 21-year old who has struggled with growing loss of sight since age 12, knowing it must culminate in blindness. Captain James Trevillion, age 33,  has lost his position in the British cavalry because one of his legs -- broken on two separate occasions -- is so weakened that he must rely on a cane to walk.Trevillion now works as Phoebe's bodyguard, hired by her protective brother. Initially, Phoebe strongly resents his watchfulness and her curtailed freedoms. The conflict between Phoebe and James slowly evolves into a friendship and then a romance, as each learns more about the other's vulnerabilities and both of them struggle for independence and the respect of others in an 18th century society that regarded people with disabilities as inferior.The author carefully supplies details about how Phoebe and James ""work around"" their disabilities against a slowly darkening background of attempts to kidnap Phoebe, sponsored by an unknown villain.I reread the book when I finished it the first time, because I had missed some details in my haste to follow the adventures of this appealing couple. This book goes on my shelf of ""keepers.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMFNV3WAIKGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455586358#wasThisHelpful","R2LMFNV3WAIKGO","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very fond of the novel ""Quo Vadis,"" a story of the early Christians in ancient Rome, so I decided to watch a movie based on the novel.In some ways the movie is actually an improvement on the novel -- the aristocratic hero, Marcus Vinicius, was so young in the original novel, that I was always surprised by his power, ruthlessness and self-confidence. In the movie, Marcus is depicted as a Roman general and an older man by actor Robert Taylor, so his authoritarian ways are more understandable.Deborah Kerr is lovely as the Christian heroine, Lygia. She and the actor Robert Taylor have some screen chemistry, but the romance develops too quickly -- they go from antagonism to passionate love very rapidly. In the novel, the romance develops more slowly, and is more convincing.The movie's spectacle aspects are terrific -- a lot of money was spent to hire hundreds of extras and costume them and the lead actors properly. The movie works hard to show many different aspects of Roman life, just as the novel did.Anyone who enjoyed the novel will definitely enjoy the movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TH9DGPJXPSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QW8QYS#wasThisHelpful","R39TH9DGPJXPSG","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1935, a young Italian-Brazilian teenager code-named ""Elza Fernandes"" (real name: Elvira Cupello Calonio) is the mistress of a handsome, charming, older man code-named ""Miranda,"" the leader of Brazil's underground Communist party. Miranda (real name: Antonio Maciel Bonfim) promises to marry Elza, but the couple are caught up in a failed Communist revolt that leads to Miranda's imprisonment and Elza's murder.The novel is not a ""who done it?"" but a ""why done it?"" -- why did the revolt fail? Was Miranda a hero or a secret traitor? Why was Elza, an innocent and uneducated adolescent, targeted for assassination?The novel alternates between italicized sections of historical research done by the book's author and fictional reconstructions of key events told by an aging Brazilian ex-Communist to a bewildered, much younger Brazilian freelance writer decades later. This format is rather awkward. I learned a great deal about Brazilian history and politics, as well as being drawn in by the tragic romantic triangle at the heart of the fictional part of the book.I recommend this book for people interested in Brazilian history and politics, Communism, and totalitarian societies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWAPDBEKN3QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477819789#wasThisHelpful","R1CWAPDBEKN3QV","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Moon Over Tangier"" is part of a series by Janice Law in which gay artist Francis Bacon -- historically famous for his disturbing paintings and wild sex life -- functions as the investigator of various crimes.While these novels are fiction -- the real Francis Bacon had a difficult enough life without serving as a crime investigator -- the author works within what is known of Bacon's life to write plausible stories about a bemused Bacon's role in solving fairly nasty crimes.In ""Moon Over Tangier,"" Bacon has come to Morocco in the early 1950's to revive a failing love affair with a pianist who was a Royal Air Force hero during WWII and has now become an alcoholic. The couple's assistance to a badly-beaten Arab they find lying in the streets of Tangier entangles Bacon with spy networks, a corrupt art dealer specializing in fake Picassos, and parties hosting the upper-crust of Tangier's colonial society.Bacon soon finds himself painting fake Picassos, encountering dead bodies, and slowly grasping the full extent of the social abyss he has fallen into.A delightful story with a witty and resourceful hero, that is sure to appeal to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender readers, detective fiction enthusiasts, art historians, admirers of Francis Bacon's paintings, and anyone who likes a well-written crime mystery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27FDR3ALIXLC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497641497#wasThisHelpful","R27FDR3ALIXLC9","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found ""The Horse Healer"" wholly absorbing, from the moment I opened the first page, all the way to end, 539 pages later. It portrays the turmoil of 13th century Spain (around the year 1200) from the perspective of a young man studying to become a veterinarian, who is dragged into the numerous wars between the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain and the Islamic empire that occupies southern Spain.Diego de Malagon is the teenage son of a widowed innkeeper, who is abruptly orphaned during a surprise raid by the Imesebelen, the fanatical African bodyguard troops of the Arab caliph. The Imesebelen also murder Diego's sister, kidnap his two other sisters, and kill two knights who attempted to defend his family. The only family Diego has left is his Arabian mare, Sabba.Diego becomes a refugee, and then the apprentice of a Muslim veterinarian in Toldeo. He learns that many Muslims and Jews have been forced to flee the Islamic empire after its takeover by a fanatical Islamic sect called the Almohads, who view everyone who doesn't follow their brand of Islam as heretics.The rest of the novel follows Diego as he travels through Spain acquiring medical, literary and military skills. He is inexorably drawn into a network of knights, kings and churchmen trying to defeat the Almohads before the extremists conquer all of Spain and destroy every other culture within the country.Diego is the type of hero a reader can cheer for -- fair-minded, passionately interested in learning new things and struggling not to be sucked into the rampant misconduct he sees all around him.The novel also has many appealing secondary characters, such as Diego's love interests, friends, co-workers and enemies. It's a very ""you are there"" type novel that tries to be fair to all of the groups struggling to survive in medieval Spain. The novel does not romanticize the Middle Ages -- monasteries, knightly orders, churchmen -- even the feared and hated Imesebelen -- are shown as human beings with flaws and virtues.Since the novel is set during a period of extended warfare in the Middle Ages, be prepared for a lot of violence, some rapes (though not graphically described), and repeated scenes of fear and suspicion.This novel will interest medievalists, people interested in Spanish history, especially the ""Reconquista"" period, students of the Crusades, veterinarians, military history fans, and anyone interested in a story filled with adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJT9FOS1JJ18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497697557#wasThisHelpful","R1NJT9FOS1JJ18","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a documentary about the Scottish Covenanters, a group of 17th century Scottish Presbyterians, who led a war against King Charles I, an Anglican, were persecuted by his sons, Charles II and James II, died in large numbers for their faith, and were finally vindicated when James II was overthrown, and a new king and queen made Presbyterianism the national religion of Scotland again.The documentary presents the Covenanters as brave and noble martyrs for freedom of speech and religion.That's very one-sided. The Covenanters were also religious fanatics, and one of their goals was to wipe out other forms of religion in Scotland. While their initial revolt was sparked by Charles I's ill-advised attempt to introduce an Episcopalian prayer book within the staunchly Scottish Presbyterian national church, it rapidly spread into a complete overthrow of his authority, and a determination to stop Episcopalian and Roman Catholic Scots from practicing their faiths.I was shocked when the documentary went directly from the Covenanters' revolt to their persecution by King Charles II. The documentary literally skipped over a 12-year period in which the Covenanters ruled Scotland with an iron and bigoted fist.  One modern historian has compared them to the Taliban of Afghanistan.I felt that the documentary should have given some air time to the Covenanters' faults, as well as their undoubted virtues.The documentary also has positive aspects. It presented the good side of the Covenanters in detail, and contains many interesting facts about their struggle to practice their faith free of government constraints. Viewers should just understand that it is interesting, but it will not present the Covenanters in their entire human complexity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG3HY6OC0ACRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DPH8I2#wasThisHelpful","RG3HY6OC0ACRV","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Queen Christina of Sweden baffled her own 17th century society and continues to puzzle modern people. She was in some respects a 21st century woman who was somehow born in the wrong era.She became queen of Sweden as a child, but resigned from her job in her late 20s and left Sweden for Rome to pursue artistic, spiritual, and cultural interests in an urban Roman Catholic environment she found more supportive than Sweden's rigid  and mostly rural Lutheran society. Abdicating a throne to pursue ""personal interests"" was almost unheard of.The mysteries surrounding her began with her birth, when the midwives declared her to be a boy, only to discover that she was a girl. As a child, Christina looked female, but had mostly interests that were considered ""male"" in her era -- riding, hunting, weapons, military history, and Greek and Roman soldier heroes. She preferred wearing men's clothes. She was bisexual and openly fell in love with both women and men, causing immense scandal.Her favorite companions were men who were ""bad boys"" -- dissolute adventurers who were soldiers and priests ""gone wrong."" Her other preferred companions were pretty and virtuous women. Once in Rome, she developed additional interests, converting to Catholicism and becoming a passionate art patron, while continuing to live a private life outside of the social and moral boundaries of her era.In this entertaining and well-researched biography, Veronica Buckley explores Christina's adventurous life, both her victories and her defeats. Christina's wretched childhood and adult opposition to the status quo severely strained her emotional resources, leading to some dreadful tragedies and much self-centered behavior. Buckley presents Christina's dramatic journey in a fair and balanced manner. I was fascinated, and read every page.I recommend this novel for royalty fans, feminists, members of the GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender) community, Swedish history enthusiasts, students interested in 17th century intellectual history, Christians interested in the 17th century conflicts between the Protestant Reformation and the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation, and people interested in Baroque era art, music, sculpture, literature and science.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36D47YDNA74XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060736186#wasThisHelpful","R36D47YDNA74XR","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Forty Days of Celebration"" was apparently originally intended as an Advent season (the 40 days before Christmas) scripture journal. It has been adapted to be used at any time in the Christian seasonal calendar -- it still contains references to Christmas, but they are integrated with other Bible themes.The daily format of the journal consists of three or four passages from the Old and New Testaments, plus the author's ""Meditation"" of about a paragraph on the themes of the Bible passages. The author, a United Methodist Church minister, has chosen these themes: hope, peace, love and joy in Jesus Christ.Ideally, the reader of this journal is supposed to write his or her reflections on the Bible passages and the author's ""Meditation"" just below the ""Meditation."" Unfortunately, there's only room for about three or four sentences in normal handwriting under the ""Meditation"" each day.  Any new edition of the book should increase the amount of space for reader reflections.The ""Meditations"" mostly -- not always -- show a liberal theology. Here's a sample from page 68: ""God, the faithful Creator, wants justice for the people of the earth, especially those without food, freedom, power or health. . . . How can we responsibly use power to respond  to those on the margins of society?"" This ""Meditation"" puzzled me, as it seems to assume that all readers of the journal are well-off middle-class folks.Other ""Meditations"" suggest a more traditional theology -- here's an example from p. 95: ""Joseph and Mary trust that nothing is impossible for God, even in the face of profound unanswered questions. . . . How do you respond to the angel's affirmation that 'nothing is impossible for God?' ""The journal chooses heartening scripture passages.  However, the Bible version used for the journal may not please everyone -- it is the Common English Bible. This is a new translation adopted (among other translations) by the United Methodists, the Episcopal Church and several other mainline denominations -- the Episcopal Church mostly uses the New Revised Standard Version in worship, but the Common English Bible is apparently gaining popularity among the Methodists.I did not like the Common English Bible translations of many passages at all, even though the Biblical passages the author chose were good. Everyone who complained that the NIV (New International Version of the Bible) was too folksy, too contemporary, and had accuracy problems -- heck, the Common English Bible translation makes the NIV look as formal the King James Bible. The CEB Bible passages made me reluctant to use the journal, but your views may differ from mine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLK82L7BRWMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261828#wasThisHelpful","RWLK82L7BRWMZ","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very interested in the title of Leonard Sweet's new book, ""Me and We: God's New Social Gospel."" I knew only a little about the Social Gospel movement of the early 20th century and was curious to see what kind of new social gospel Sweet might suggest.Unfortunately, the book reads like a rough draft. For example, the author tries to define at pages 15 through 19 what his version of a new social gospel would be and fails. The explanation contains several complex metaphors that simply don't work together. I couldn't figure out what he was talking about, and I'm a fairly intelligent reader with a strong background in theology and several other fields.Transitions between paragraphs in the book are often non-existent. Thought A in one paragraph is suddenly dropped in a following paragraph for an unrelated Thought B in the following paragraph.The book frequently lapses into academic jargon. Here is one sample: ""However, any attempt, on whatever end of the theological spectrum, to move Christianity toward a mere propositional matrix rather than a relational mesh is a regressive, not a progressive, act."" (p. 10) Huh? Please explain?This book also has factual errors. For example, the author claims that ""individualism and depression (melancholia) developed simultaneously in Western culture from 1600 upwards."" (p. 21) That's just not true -- there are Roman Empire era medical treatises mentioning depression and discussing treatments for it.On p. 19 the author suggests that St. Paul described the Christians of Laodicea as lukewarm in their faith. Actually it was John of Patmos in the book of Revelations. (According to the last chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians, Paul wrote a letter to the Laodiceans at one time, but it appears to have been lost.)I finally gave up around page 30.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVA4SZL1O64B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142675776X#wasThisHelpful","RXVA4SZL1O64B","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Five Years in Heaven: The Unlikely Friendship That Answered Life's Greatest Questions"" is a memoir of a friendship between an 87-year-old nun and a 31-year-old writer and publicist whose career crash had driven him back to his small, rural hometown.I'm an Anglo-Catholic Episcopalian, so I was looking forward to see what kind of spiritual advice Sister Augustine would give John Schlimm. While their friendship seems to have been wonderful for both of them -- she encouraged him to successfully restart his career and he publicized her ceramics, making her regionally famous -- the spiritual and psychological advice she gave him didn't seem that unusual, didn't answer life's greatest questions -- though it did answer many of Schlimm's questions -- and frankly was a little on the dull side.For example, pages and pages are devoted to Sister Augustine's cats -- I like cats, but briefer descriptions would have worked better.Sister Augustine and Schlimm shared common interests as artists and teachers, but reading their conversations is like sitting in a room where you can hear a happily-married couple discussing their daily concerns in the next room -- whose turn is it to mow the lawn? The couple is clearly very happy and deeply intertwined in their shared interests, but their conversations may not have much relevance for the listener's life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9GL8C5Y8OBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553446576#wasThisHelpful","RE9GL8C5Y8OBV","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 20something narrator of ""His Own Man"" initially seems to have an idyllic life ahead of him. The son of a Brazilian diplomat, he has followed in his father's footsteps, securing a job in Brazil's prestigious Ministry of Foreign Affairs, housed in the luxurious Itamaraty Palace in Rio de Janeiro. He can look forward to a financially and socially rewarding career.But In December 1968, Brazil is ruled by a relatively new right-wing military dictatorship, that uses increasingly brutal tactics to keep a restive population under control. The narrator confides his misgivings about the regime to his idol, a slightly older 20something coworker named Max, who embodies everything the narrator admires -- good looks, humor, tact, vast literary knowledge, aristocratic ancestry, moderate political views and an ability to manage their bosses.But is Max a Brazilian patriot who is simply biding his time at Itamaraty until democracy is restored in Brazil? Or is Max an agent of the dictatorship, cloaking his real allegiance behind smooth manners, social charm and rationalizations? Or is Max's real allegiance only to himself?As the narrator takes one path -- accepting diplomatic assignments that take him out of Brazil and away from contact with the dictatorship -- Max plunges into intrigue. The narrator slowly pieces together the truth about his adored friend over a period of several decades, from documents, interviews with Max's ex-wife and other diplomats, and gradually reaches a chilling conclusion.The novel is a story of friendship, betrayal and the tough choices faced by decent people living under a tyranny. It is written in an elegant, but lucid style, and chapters alternate between the narrator's life as a young man and his life as an older diplomat, as he gradually learns the full extent of his friend's actual activities and intentions.Readers interested in Portuguese language literature, Brazilian history, the story of how the CIA and U.S. politicians supported the military dictatorships of Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina in the late 20th century, fans of spy novels, and people who like psychological thrillers will enjoy this book.The nearest comparison to this book that I have ever read was Klaus Mann's ""Mephisto,"" a fictionalized biography of how Klaus Mann's brother-in-law, an actor, preserved his career by joining the Nazis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341O7VJ2IF496/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590516982#wasThisHelpful","R341O7VJ2IF496","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Clara"" describes the life of a young woman and her family -- Austrians, actually, not Germans -- during the 1930s and 1940s, showing how even ""good Germans/Austrians"" were gradually pulled into Nazi-dominated societies.When the novel opens in October 1932, Clara is a graduate student in Vienna, studying for her doctorate. She plans to become a college professor who teaches literature or philosophy, and is studying with heavyweights like Sigmund Freud and Martin Heidegger. She is in love with an Austrian cavalry officer, who is also a skilled horse trainer. One of her friends is a Jew, and she thinks she might vote for the Social Democrats.But when the Great Depression of the 1930s capsizes Austria's economy, causing bank collapses, unemployment and massive homelessness, thousands of Austrians join the Communists or the Nazis, kill each other in street battles, and engage in violent attempts to overthrow the ineffective Austrian republic.Clara and her lover are not Nazis, but they find themselves slowly, inexorably drawn into Nazi connections through a foolish young family member. This family member dies for the Nazi cause, resulting in a legal catastrophe for the rest of her lover's family and establishing a permanent and unwelcome benevolent interest in Clara and her lover on the part of the Nazi authorities who eventually take over Austria.The novel alternates between Clara's life as a student and as a German army wife and her life as an elderly writer and translator in the early 21st century. The Nazi takeover of Austria and World War II are seen through the eyes of Clara and her civilian female friends as they struggle to survive a crazy totalitarian dictatorship and frequent bombings by the Allies.I enjoyed the novel and found it engrossing reading. My only criticism was the transitions in the narrative from young Clara's experiences to older Clara's current life were not always clearly indicated. The author may wish to put notations such as ""Vienna, 1932"" or ""St. Tollden, 2004"" at the heads of chapters or transitions within chapters. I could follow the transitions, but had to keep alert for them.This novel will interest WWII history buffs, military history enthusiasts, Austrian history students, and people who like a romantic heroine with courage and determination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUN6DQWEMPTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771071329#wasThisHelpful","R3OUN6DQWEMPTS","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of ""Coffee, Tea and Holy Water: One Woman's Journey to Experience Christianity Around the Globe"" misleadingly suggests that the author looked at the full spectrum of Christian churches in several cultures.In actuality, the book is a short, light weight account of a young American Protestant evangelical's visits to a few different Protestant evangelical churches and missionary medical clinics in five countries -- Brazil, Wales, Tanzania, China and Honduras. It might better have been titled ""Impressions of A Few Protestant Evangelical Churches and Medical Clinics in Five Different Cultures.""The author, raised in a large, strongly fundamentalist Protestant church in the Deep South, just ignores churches that are different from her own. For example, she visits Brazil, which she explains is the largest Roman Catholic country in the world, but her sole visit to a Catholic site is the large statute of Jesus Christ on a mountain overlooking Rio.Instead of then discussing a bit about the Roman Catholic church's successes and failures in Brazil, and perhaps how these contrast with those of the Protestant evangelical churches she visited, she devotes time to learning about the spiritist culture of Brazil, a mixture of Christianity, vodoo, Satanism and other faiths and contrasting that faith with the merits of evangelical Protestant Christianity.The author has a number of perceptive things to say about the interactions of national cultures and Protestant evangelical Christianity in each country that she visits. But I did get very tired of visiting one cinder block church after another, crammed with praise bands. I'm an Episcopalian, and I found her avoidance of all forms of Christianity except her own puzzling and disturbing.At first I thought that she ignored other forms of Christianity besides her own because of time and money limits during her travels, but she had time to visit a national wildlife park in Tanzania and get a massage in China, so she obviously did have time to visit churches with theologies and liturgies different from her own.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYI7QGZ3LR7IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426793138#wasThisHelpful","RYI7QGZ3LR7IX","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read ""How Jews Became Germans"" with great interest, because I am a member of an interfaith family.Professor Hertz originally wrote an account of Jewish women intellectuals in 18th and 19th century Berlin who ran influential salons that hosted Christians and Jews discussing new ideas. She then wrote this book as a follow-up, and used data collected by the Nazis in the 1930s from centuries-old church archives on intermarried Jews and their descendants.The result reads almost like a novel. It is a fascinating portrait of many Jews who converted to Christianity for a wide variety of reasons, especially the Berlin salon hostesses and the Jewish male and female intellectuals who were their salon guests, friends and relatives.Some Jews converted to Christianity because they could not advance in their professions unless they changed religions. Other Jews were sincerely tired of the narrow and legalistic form of Orthodox Judaism which was the only form of Judaism available in Germany at that time, and found Christianity more appealing theologically and emotionally.Still other Jewish converts to Christianity changed religions so they could legally marry Christian lovers. Yet a fourth group of converts were committed German nationalists who felt that as long as they remained Jews, they could never become truly part of their beloved Germany.The author deals with her subjects, many of them eminent intellectuals of the early 19th century, with patience and kindness, showing that two factors finally slowed the large number of Jewish conversions into Christianity by the mid-19th century.First, Reform Judaism developed, which offered Jews discontented with Orthodox Judaism a form of Jewish practice that they found more appealing. Second, many of the laws and social customs making conversion to Christianity mandatory for participation in various professions, intermarriage, and in other settings gradually relaxed, allowing Jews to keep their ethnic and religious identities as Jews while participating more fully in Christian German society as German Jews.For anyone interested in why Jews opt to remain Jews or leave Judaism for Christianity, this is a well-written study that is still relevant to today's Jewish and Christian communities worldwide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROS929PRTWLL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300151640#wasThisHelpful","ROS929PRTWLL9","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel will appeal to many audiences -- military history buffs, fans of the Kipling and Conan Doyle novels, people interested in a well-researched and truthful picture of colonial India, and just about anyone interested in a mystery and thriller set in the chaotic India of 1837.Ensign William Avery is stuck in cholera-plagued, miserably hot Calcutta in 1837. His India is not the India of later Victorian era -- ""the Raj"" -- ruled directly and relatively efficiently by British government bureaucrats -- but the pre-Victorian India, run by the British East India Company, a trading corporation that has morphed into a corrupt, greedy and ruthless semi-government of large parts of India.Avery, a 20something soldier from a gentry family, is ordered by ""the Company"" to accompany a man he loathes -- Jeremiah Blake, an older, mysterious former captain from the slums of London -- on a secret mission to find a missing famous poet and writer, Xavier Mountstuart -- a Byronic figure with so many enemies that he may already be dead. One rumor says he's been kidnapped by ""Thuggee"" ritual killers, who strangle their victims.Blake and Avery journey hundreds of miles searching for Mountstuart, slowly getting to know each other. Blake has a combination of Sherlock Holmes' detective skills and a grasp of Indian languages and customs straight out of Kipling's ""Kim"" -- but as he and Avery gradually immerse themselves in Indian and European groups, Avery learns that the real ""strangler vine"" of India may not be the Thuggees or other Indian rebels, but the ruthless, arrogant British ""Company"" and its growing tyranny over the Indians.The novel is filled with both adventures and interesting panoramas of India in that era -- unlike Kipling's and other 19th century novels, the earliest British colonial military, traders and civilians are shown in this novel both in their strengths and weaknesses, and ""equal time"" is given to the culture, feelings and history of the Indians themselves.While there are plenty of adventures in the novel, there are many thoughtful passages and characters' reflections about the two clashing cultures that make this novel much more interesting than the average ""adventure novel in British India.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDVDZ7CWS8ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171673#wasThisHelpful","R2CDVDZ7CWS8ZT","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""As Good As Dead,"" is a ""dramedy"" (comedy plus drama) about how a youthful act of betrayal by one student of a close friend at the famed Iowa Writers' Workshop in the late 1980s has unexpected and terrible consequences extending years into the future, affecting both students' careers, marriages, finances, reputations and children.Charlotte Price appears beautiful and brilliant, but behind the facade she feels deeply shy and insecure, growing up with hostile working class parents who believe her interest in writing and books is foolish. Charlotte hides her insecurity as best she can, including silencing it with alcohol and drugs.Her roommate, Esme Cole, has everything Charlotte does not -- self-confidence, comfort with her own good looks, indulgent upper-class parents, the ability to drink and drug without becoming addicted, and the capacity to make friends with anyone.Esme and Charlotte form a close, but highly volatile friendship, in which Charlotte gradually fears her life is being taken over by a ""frenemy,"" a friend who is a rival. Esme belittles Charlotte in many ways, and Charlotte finally engages in a secret act of betrayal that will put both of their lives off-track for many years.The novel travels back and forth between Charlotte's and Esme's past in Iowa, and their present -- twenty years later -- in Tuscon, where both women live with their husbands, but in dramatically different circumstances. I read the novel twice -- once because I was desperate to find out how the complex story ended -- and a second time to relish the meticulously-depicted hothouse world of academia that that the author ably portrays.This is a well-constructed, gripping novel about the deviousness of the human heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6I1Y6EO94GEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162040298X#wasThisHelpful","R6I1Y6EO94GEA","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed Justin Taylor's ""Flings,"" a collection of short stories, and yet I had some reservations when I finished.His language is vivid, and readers are plunged into the situations -- a young man fleeing a commitment-minded girlfriend, for example -- very quickly.Taylor also has much wit, describing an estranged Baby Boomer Jewish father as developing ""a bombastic pride in his heritage -- this despite a near-perfect indifference to its teachings or practice."" His Millenial daughter, seeking reconciliation with him, reflects, ""This was common among Jewish men in their late middle age, Danielle thought; she had many friends whose fathers had done the same.""But the people inhabiting the short stories are sometimes unpleasant and self-destructive -- not to mention dishonest and lacking in self-perception -- it was hard to care about what happened to them.

"I've already read this book twice, I enjoyed it so much!When I began this book, I knew only a little about Josephine. I had always assumed that she was a trivial personality, the cast-off first wife of a great man.Kate Williams' biography of the Empress Josephine showed me that I was greatly mistaken. In an account as gripping as a novel, and filled with direct quotes from Josephine's letters to Napoleon and other people, Williams traces the evolution of a badly-educated, naive girl from the French colonial aristocracy of Martinique to the astute wife of the most powerful man in Europe.Ms. Williams shows how Josephine overcame laziness, promiscuity, two difficult marriages, sexual exploitation by powerful men, an addiction to making money by shady means, and many other character flaws to remake herself as the faithful, kindly and charitable consort of an egotistic ruler.I was astonished to learn that Josephine was a self-taught and learned botanist with an in-depth understanding of many plant and animal species. She was also an astute art collector. Many other evidences of her innate intelligence were concealed behind her facade of a dutiful, shopaholic wife.I was also surprised to learn that Napoleon's and Josephine's sexual relationship continued to the end of their marriage, despite their infidelities. They were evidently deeply in love, and Napoleon's divorce of Josephine was one of his most costly mistakes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2YHCTAZD1BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345522834#wasThisHelpful","R1T2YHCTAZD1BV","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Vatican Waltz"" will interest Roman Catholic readers, other Christians with an interest in the lives of the saints and Roman Catholic mysticism, and both friends and opponents of the Roman Catholic Church.The novel initially appears to be asking: what are saints like as young children and young adults? Cynthia Piantedosi is raised by her widowed Italian Catholic father and maternal grandmother in a rough working class town near Boston.In early childhood shy, studious, pious Cynthia begins experiencing slight blackouts in which she is granted visions and messages from God. She discusses these occurrences primarily with two politically liberal priests, devoting hours to prayer, but otherwise living an ordinary life.So far, her life story sounds very much like that of many of Roman Catholic saints when they were children and young adults.Gradually, her story darkens -- a vocal, powerful, secretive right-wing opposition group within the Church seems involved in the death of one of the two priests she trusts.Cynthia goes to nursing school, and her visions shift. She believes that she is being commanded to become a Roman Catholic priest. But there is a problem -- the Roman Catholic Church doesn't ordain women.Nevertheless, Cynthia, previously an obedient daughter of the Church, begins visiting one senior priest after another, urging that the ordination of women be allowed. She finally travels to Italy, to argue her case with the higher Catholic authorities.At this point I became a little skeptical. The story is set around 2005 -- wouldn't Cynthia first have gotten in touch with other women who have tried to be ordained as Catholic priests? -- it would be easy, thanks to the internet -- before pestering senior priests, bishops and cardinals?The novel's descriptions of Italy -- the churches, the food, the people, the scenery -- are wonderful and felt very authentic. Its descriptions of Cynthia's encounters with the Catholic hierarchy took me into the realm of conspiracy theorists.Despite her humble and polite manner, and her youth -- the Church hierarchy treats Cynthia as if she were dangerous to the Church -- and there are growing hints that the right-wing Catholic extremist group which may have killed one of her priests is targeting her for elimination.This kind of plot might work in a novel set in General Pinochet's dictatorship of Chile (1970's) or in a novel set in the 16th century Spain of the Holy Inquisition -- but if a fanatical group within the Catholic church in 2005 was killing American and Italian Catholics who convincingly advocated for change in the Church, the streets of both countries would have been strewn with dead Catholic clergy and lay people.Nevertheless, the author builds up a compellingly menacing atmosphere around the pious and kindly young woman. I thought, OK, this novel is actually asking: how would a secret society of fanatical Roman Catholics react to a future saint who advocated for change within the Church?But the author abruptly changes the direction of the novel a third time. Cynthia discovers her real Christian spiritual mission -- a mission that is far more unlikely than becoming a female Roman Catholic priest.The ending is subtly foreshadowed in various parts of the novel, but I still found it unbelievable. The novel is very interesting and well-written, but it's as if the author couldn't decide whether he was writing about the development of a saint, the formation of conspiracies within the Church to stop changes, or an even more improbable spiritual mission to revive the Church.I found the novel enjoyable, but sometimes exasperating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQCLIY6G7OI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307452956#wasThisHelpful","R1GQCLIY6G7OI2","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed ""An American Duchess"" -- it is a well-researched novel set in the post-World War I era in England. The plot is fairly standard. Starchy, highly educated, financially ruined English nobleman, deeply wounded physically and emotionally by crushing war experiences and losses, falls in love with young, assertive, poorly educated American woman whose wealth conceals her own difficult past and war losses.Can this relationship work?Nigel is a war hero, but since his return from WWI, he wants peace and quiet on his estate, and a complete return to his lost traditional English past -- nothing will change in his life or on his family estate.Zoe, daughter of a self-made American millionaire, has reacted to her own tragedies by embracing everything modern in the Roaring Twenties -- she manages her own fortune, pilots airplanes and drives fast motor cars, in an era when few women did. She also attends innumerable wild parties.While the complex plot threads about the relationship between the hero and heroine were engrossing, and their numerous culture clashes were realistically portrayed, I wasn't convinced that they could have overcome the huge gaps in their differing life experiences to forge a lasting marriage. But as a glimpse into the Roaring Twenties and the impact of WWI on previously staid Edwardian high society in England and America, the novel provided me with many laugh out loud moments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUY2RUX17PKS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373779291#wasThisHelpful","RUY2RUX17PKS1","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Word Exchange"" plunges the reader into an alternative history in which a popular smart phone's electronic virus not only ruins computers and other smart phones, but starts infecting, injuring and killing people.The novel is long and slow-paced, but filled with rich and intricate details about the chilling impact of the virus on a world that is heavily dependent on electronic communications.Anana Johnson and her friend and co-worker, Bart, are 20somethings working for a New York-based non-profit producing a major dictionary. When Anana's father, president of the non-profit, abruptly disappears, and Anana and Bart develop severe flu symptoms and sometimes speak gibberish, they begin a race to locate Anana's father before the ""word flu"" claims their lives. They believe that Anana's father may hold clues to the sinister origin and possible treatments of the ""word flu.""But how can they conduct this search when they must avoid using the internet and smart phones, and even aging cell phones are starting to show signs of infection? Older and safer sources of knowledge and communication -- libraries, fax machines, printed newspapers and magazines, land line telephones, letters sent by postal mail service, paper posters and brochures, and pneumatic tubes -- have nearly all vanished thanks to the growth of the internet, leaving Anana and Bart with few places to turn to for help.I enjoyed the novel tremendously. I had only two complaints.I did think that the author, in an effort to realistically depict her two dictionary geek protagonists, used way too many obscure words and concepts in some sections of the novel. For example, I didn't need a full page lecture on the philosopher Hegel, complete with German terms for his ideas, to see that the two protagonists are intelligent.I also found the depictions of infected people speaking gibberish to be too detailed, as whole paragraphs from conversations, journals and emails were pockmarked with nonsense words where one or two such paragraphs would have sufficed.But the novel's plot interested me, and its depiction of the immense societal damage caused by such a virus, as seen through Anana's and Bart's eyes, was cleverly drawn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z7DCRQBCMMPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537654#wasThisHelpful","R2Z7DCRQBCMMPJ","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy ghost stories. I also enjoy ghost stories with romantic and historical elements. A love affair between an architecture professor who buys an old house and the ghost of a beautiful young woman who has haunted the house since 1840 seemed right up my alley.Unfortunately, I couldn't suspend disbelief at a number of plot elements. First, the woman ghost has been haunting this house since 1840. She is understandably desperate to understand why she has not passed over into the afterlife. But not once -- as far as I could tell -- does she pray, mention God or check out a Bible.This is a financially well-off woman from 1840, an era in which religion saturated America. Consulting the beliefs typical of her era would have been her first step after finding herself stranded as a ghost following her death. She is, after all, able to read modern newspapers, magazines, and watch television. There would undoubtedly have been a Bible in the house at the time of her death.Second, her modern lover doesn't really check out any spiritual resources on his own. Instead, claiming to be writing a novel, he pays one of his graduate students to do some internet research on psychics for him. No professor who wanted to keep his new interest in ghosts absolutely secret would entrust such research to a graduate student, students being notoriously gossipy.Finally, the ghost expert that the professor finds in the modern era to help him and his beloved seems to have very peculiar credentials. There are many modern psychics and ghost experts with far better credentials and training. The expert's advice sounded utterly implausible, even for a ghost story, where I am normally willing to allow major implausibilities.These doubts killed off the story for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5HUJP0ARIA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062218808#wasThisHelpful","R1B5HUJP0ARIA9","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since World War II ended in 1945, memoirs, biographies and other books documenting the lives of artists and writers who lived in Paris during the Roaring Twenties, the Depression and World War II have poured out of publishing companies.Biographies and memoirs about Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Henry Miller, and dozens of other famous expatriate and French artists and writers have appeared. Simultaneously, numerous accounts of the French resistance groups who attacked the Germans during the German occupation of France have been issued, along with histories of the Holocaust, and disturbing revelations of how French collaborators with the Nazis handed over many of France's Jews and other French citizens to the Germans.Novelist Francine Prose has written a comic novel which basically makes fun of all of these genres. The novel is composed of alternating selections from fictitious letters, memoirs and biographical materials written by a photographer, a writer, the owner of a gay and lesbian night club, a French Resistance leader, an arrogant French aristocrat, and a famous French female athlete (apparently lesbian and transgender) who goes from being a patriot to a traitor who works for the Gestapo.These characters are all given fictitious names, but they are clearly based on historical figures. For example, sex-obsessed American writer Lionel Maine is clearly based on American writer Henry Miller, while Lou Villars, the French athlete turned traitor, shares much of her life history with real life pioneering French athlete Violette Morris, who ultimately turned traitor.I laughed out loud repeatedly as the author caught perfectly the ""voice"" in which many memoirs, autobiographies and biographies of this era are written -- the boasting and name dropping of the male artists and writers about their sexual conquests and creative work, the contentious French Resistance memoir where the Resistance leader appears mostly concerned with herself, the aristocrat who serves in the Resistance, but indignantly rejects accusations that she scooped up art work from desperate artists at bargain prices after the German invasion -- she wants the reader to understand that she did the artists a favor!More poignant is the fictional biography of Lou Villars, who starts out as a good person, but is slowly embittered by constant mistreatment because she is lesbian/transgender to the point that she starts viewing other French people as her enemies and the Germans as her friends. Even this tragedy has elements of humor -- Francine Prose gives Villars a neurotic, academic feminist, politically correct biographer, clearly deeply troubled, who keeps interrupting Villars' sad story to complain about her own much less interesting life and emotional problems.My only complaint about the novel is that the real life Violette Morris was about 20 years older than Lou Villars and had an established record as an Olympics participant and as a heroic messenger and nurse for the French armed forces during World War I. Her treason was rooted in being booted out of her athletic world by a French society uncomfortable with her lifestyle, an act she experienced -- correctly -- as an extreme betrayal.She was a brilliant athlete and intelligent, not that I'm excusing her terrible crimes. Whereas the ""Lou Villars"" of the novel is depicted as not very bright, not nearly as high-achieving in sports as Morris, and -- while understandably bitter at how she was treated as a lesbian/transgender person -- not high profile enough and not intelligent enough, in my opinion, to have been sought out as a potential key spy and Gestapo torturer by the Germans.But other than that complaint, I thoroughly enjoyed the rogues gallery Prose presents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22IS6ROEE9SQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061713783#wasThisHelpful","R22IS6ROEE9SQ0","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Visitors"" is a beautifully-written book with fascinating characters, but it is damaged by its attempt to combine two novels in one book. I enjoyed reading it, but it did take time.The first novel describes the deadly intrigues, love affairs, politics, lies and secrets that swirled around the discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's treasure-filled gravesite in Egypt in 1922. The story is narrated as seen through the eyes of Lucy Fox-Payne, an 11-year-old who has been sent to Egypt with a chaperone to recover from typhoid fever. While the insights of Lucy and two of her girl friends seem way too sophisticated for elementary school age children -- they talk like educated teenagers who are about 18 years old -- their children's eye view of the unscrupulous adults around them makes for an absorbing and well-researched novel.Unfortunately, the author moves back and forth between the Egyptian novel and a second novel -- the story of how Lucy survives a very dysfunctional childhood and adolescence to become a successful writer. Upon Lucy's return from her first trip to Egypt, her widowed father, a selfish and bullying Cambridge don, marries an equally selfish and bullying young woman on the fringes of the Bloomsbury Circle of writers and artists. Lucy's experiences trying to survive a home that her father shares with her stepmother's lesbian lover -- a selfish Bloomsbury Circle artist -- and Lucy's unhappy first marriage to a selfish Bloomsbury Circle poet -- are very interesting, but appear to be a second novel that co-exists uneasily with the first one.The two novels are tied together by chapters depicting Lucy in her early nineties, looking back on the first 30 years of her life. While I enjoyed ""The Visitors,"" readers will need patience to absorb the book's 509 pages and the shifts in viewpoint between Egypt in the 1920s, England in the 1930's and 1940's, and modern London around the year 2000. I was willing to put in the time required to read the book because I'm a passionate Anglophile, and the book offers lovely descriptions of England and its changing social classes in various eras.Both novels feel somewhat incomplete, as if they were conjoined (Siamese) twins, sharing the same book cover, but each needing more room. The author might have done better to write two separate novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQYKYAP5OFQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006230268X#wasThisHelpful","RWQYKYAP5OFQR","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""One Night in Winter,"" set in 1945 during World War II and the Stalinist dictatorship of Russia, describes what happens when a romantic triangle among some high school students, ending in a murder-suicide, has catastrophic consequences for the teens who befriended the dead students and their parents.For the dead teens are not ordinary youth -- they are the children of vicious dictator Joseph Stalin's courtiers -- his top bureaucrats and generals -- in a closed totalitarian society where any crime, love affair or other unusual behavior among the Communist Party elite's children can be used to ruin them and their parents, leading to job loss and imprisonment.I was captured by the plight of the surviving students and their parents from the moment the book opened, and raced through it to see what would become of them as they were imprisoned and questioned by Stalin's secret police.This is the rare adult novel that might appeal to a young adult demographic as well.Author Simon Sebag Montefiore is a respected biographer of mid-20th century Russian dictator, Joseph Stalin. Since completing his two volume biography of Stalin, Montefiore has written two novels about the private lives of Stalin's elite -- ""Sashenka"" and ""One Night in Winter.""

"""The Secret Life of Violet Grant"" is actually composed of two novels. One novel describes the early life of Violet Grant, a woman physicist working in Oxford and Berlin in 1914, and her disappearance with her alleged lover after the murder of her husband, an older, famous scientist.The second novel is a social comedy set in 1960s New York City, the era of the ""Mad Men"" television series. The heroine is the great-niece of Violet Grant, a young college graduate from the same upper-crust family her great-aunt belonged to. The great-niece, Vivian, receives a mysterious suitcase from Europe with tantalizing clues about what happened to her great-aunt, and resolves to write a magazine article about what happened.The novel set in 1914 is very good. The author clearly shows the tenuous position of women in the sciences, in an era where such an occupation was thought unladylike. Violet struggles to carry out her research and win the esteem of colleagues who include the young Albert Einstein. She also struggles with a growing attraction to a handsome young British officer, who is very different from her much older, philandering, selfish husband.The novel set in 1960s Manhattan is a failure. While the author's historical research is as meticulous as in the 1914 novel, the characters seem to have escaped from a failed sitcom. They speak in snappy one liners, even in very serious situations, and are shallow as puddles.The ending of the novel, where the author attempts to merge characters from both novels, is quite unrealistic. I was skeptical that people ""on the lam"" from a murder accusation could have hidden in plain sight for decades.I would give the 1914 novel a ""4"" and the 1960s novel a ""2."" That works out to a ""3."" I wish the author had simply written a longer 1914 novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1KGRE6V59SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162178#wasThisHelpful","R1O1KGRE6V59SF","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Woman Who Would Be King"" is a compelling biography of an ancient Egyptian princess, who through sheer talent, personality, and political shrewdness, became king -- not queen -- of Egypt and had a highly successful reign.Princess Hatshepsut faced disaster as a teenager. As the high priestess of Egypt's most powerful god, and the chief wife of her younger half-brother, Pharaoh Thutmose II, her future seemed assured, but Thutmose II was sickly and died young. Hatshepsut became regent for Thutmose II's infant son by another wife, but it seemed doubtful that a teenage girl and a baby king could keep their dynasty on the throne.Would Hatshepsut and her infant stepson be replaced by an adult male relative? Or would Egypt descend into chaos, as competing family members intrigued and fought for the throne?How Hatshepsut seized power, eventually proclaiming herself king and co-ruler with her stepson, maintained her shaky dynasty on the throne, and served as a competent and efficient ruler, is a story that author Kara Cooney narrates almost like a novel. Piecing together temple inscriptions, papyrus texts, and tomb pictures, Cooney manages to convincingly recreate Hatshepsut's life in an era where women might serve as regents, but almost never became rulers themselves.I found the book engrossing. In the course of following Hatshepsut's life, I learned about Egyptian temple rituals, Hatshepsut's use of her position as high priestess to enhance her support among the powerful clergy, and many other aspects of ancient Egypt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYFJ4D8VJDA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956768#wasThisHelpful","R1GYFJ4D8VJDA9","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The conventional view of the 1950s is that the entire decade was a major setback for women's rights in the U.S. and Britain, as millions of women were swept out of their jobs in offices and factories at the end of World War II and dispatched to lives as housewives.British writer Rachel Cooke decided to highlight the other side -- women who managed to maintain and expand their careers in the face of intense societal pressure against employed women.In ""Her Brilliant Career,"" a gossipy and thoroughly enjoyable set of essays, Cooke explores the careers and love lives of ten British women who were well-known in their careers in the 1950s -- a film director, a food writer, an architect, an archaeologist and others -- but who have since been eclipsed in public awareness by the coverage of the more flamboyant and numerous career women of the feminist 1960s and 1970s.The career women she selected are a fascinating group -- they range from Margery Fish, a brilliant elderly gardening writer, whose career did not exist until after the death of her loved, but domineering husband, to the stable lesbian triangle of journalist Nancy Spain, publisher Joan Laurie and race car driver Sheila van Damm.The author writes with humor, sympathy, tolerance and kindness of her ten career women, who subverted 1950s norms to lead lives better suited to 2014.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6Y0ENO92FGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333860#wasThisHelpful","R1D6Y0ENO92FGK","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read every page of this novel and was sorry when it ended. It is a richly detailed portrait of a civil war in Spain between 1701 and 1714 and how fighting in that civil war alters the life and perceptions of a previously carefree and amoral rogue.""Victus"" begins as a typical 18th century novel of a rogue's humorous misadventures. It is narrated by Marti Zuviria, who -- when the novel opens -- is a teenage military engineering student in France. His primary interest in life -- other than drawing maps of fortifications -- is his teacher's pretty, red-headed daughter.Marti is a foreign student -- he is a citizen of Catalonia, a rebellious province of Spain -- but in an era in which military engineers habitually sell themselves to the highest royal bidders, his Catalan background has little meaning. Both Marti and his tutors assume that he will enter the French military service.Marti's career plans suffer a serious setback when his mentor dies. He then travels with a French army to Spain to support a French prince's claim to the vacant Spanish throne. On arrival, he discovers that his province, Catalonia, and its capital city, Barcelona, are supporting a rival Austrian prince's claim to the Spanish throne, because they fear the French prince will end Catalonia's ancient constitution and liberties.Marti is thrown into a maelstrom of conflicting loyalties, clashing love affairs, and encounters with two battling armies where no one can be trusted because so many people have changed sides repeatedly. But when he returns to Barcelona and becomes part of its military defense team, he is forced to make moral choices that will scar him -- physically and emotionally -- for the rest of his life.Eventually, he must decide whether he can save his beloved Barcelona -- and his loved ones trapped within the city -- by betraying the city during a terrible siege.I turned each page right to the end of the book, wondering what choices Marti would make.The author's research on the era is extensive -- the reader meets characters from every walk of life and follows their struggles to survive in the middle of a civil war. The novel reminded me of many American Civil War novels.This novel will interest military history fans, 18th century history buffs and anyone who likes an intense tale of moral conflicts and exciting adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39I8751UPZ4HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062323962#wasThisHelpful","R39I8751UPZ4HC","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"England lost an entire generation of young men during World War I, leaving desolate families all over the United Kingdom. Thousands more veterans returned with permanent mental and physical injuries. Anna Hope's ""Wake"" describes three women from families whose men died or were injured during the war, and how they finally come to terms with their losses and try to start new lives.Novelist Hope has done very thorough research on World War I and the beginning of the Jazz Age afterwards. The stories of the women feel authentic -- Ada continuously sees the ghost of her only son in the streets of her village; Evelyn has become an embittered spinster after losing her fiance; and Hettie helps support a brother reduced to nearly permanent silence by ""shell shock.""The book is well-written and flows easily. There are no jarring anachronisms. Even the advertising is taken directly from newspapers and magazines of the era.My only problem with the book is that it is very dark. If you are having a depressing week, wait to read it until things in your life improve. While each woman slowly works out positive adaptations to the dreadful losses she has experienced, the mercifully brief accounts of the Western front during WWI are stomach-turning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0YFC8JO6XWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995139#wasThisHelpful","R1L0YFC8JO6XWF","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will Baker, a 25-year-old American WASP from a ""Mayflower"" families background, smarting from the defeat of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, in which he was a senior worker, and disturbed by the recent death of his estranged drug addict father, abruptly drops his New York City girl friend, apartment and political life to spend a year getting a master's degree in English at Oxford University.The novel is beautifully written. The descriptions of Oxford, London and England are truly lyrical, and the reader feels transported to the country, admiring everything from boat races between Cambridge and Oxford to the light as the sun sets on the university's lawns.But beautiful writing in this type of ""young adult grows up"" novel is like a frame for a painting -- it's bad if the frame is more beautiful than the painting, and that seems to be the case with this novel. The beautiful writing frames a story that is not very interesting.The expectation for this type of college novel is that the heroes or the anti-heroes will make significant discoveries about themselves and exhibit some type of growth.Will simply doesn't do that. He finds replacement girl friends, has an unhappy love affair, behaves badly to his girl friends, half-heartedly considers pursuing a Ph.D. in English -- he has a trust fund -- and the end of the novel finds him little different than when it began.His friends at Oxford, evenly divided between the children of very wealthy families and middle class scholarship students, are actually much more interesting than Will, and do make some changes in their lives, but there is nothing especially interesting about most of their lives or personal changes.The novel also has structural problems that an editor could fix -- Will behaves badly to women, but the family problems in which his behavior is rooted are not explained until the book is two-thirds over. There's also an entire chapter about Will visiting an old friend in Paris that does nothing to advance the plot and could easily have been cut.There are many references to political events within the Kerry campaign and the war in Afghanistan which may render the novel incomprehensible to younger readers within another generation. These references needed to be removed or gracefully explained within the novel itself.I read the novel once, but would not reread it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R470XI8P8UVL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250018714#wasThisHelpful","R470XI8P8UVL8","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The depravity of the Renaissance era is no secret -- within the last few decades at least two gaudy television series about one of the most evil Popes, Alexander Borgia and his equally icky illegitimate children, have been produced. Many novels and much poetry about Renaissance Italy, filled to the brim with murder and adultery, have been published in the last three centuries.But historian Alexander Lee believes that modern admirers of the art and literature of the Renaissance tend to romanticize the era, seeing only the beautiful altarpieces and statues like Michelangelo's David in isolation from the horrific society which produced them. He argues that moderns tend to believe that people who paid for and produced art and poetry that beautiful couldn't have been bigots,  murderers and rapists, and must instead be close to moderns in their thinking. Lee's book tries to break up the sanitized picture of the Renaissance as a wonderful time of intellectual discovery and show its seamy underside.In ""The Ugly Renaissance,"" Lee describes how many of the altarpieces, with pictures of the art patrons painted into them, were given to churches to alleviate the guilt that the wealthy merchants, violent soldiers and corrupt church officials felt about their sin-stained lives. Huge libraries were built by merchants fearing that they would spend eternity in purgatory or hell for ruthless acts of usury.Lee writes in an engaging style as he takes the reader on tours of breathtaking crimes and atrocities, followed by commissions to Raphael or Fra Lippi that were intended as atonement for the crimes. Even readers who are not convinced that the public has a sanitized view of Renaissance Italy can learn much from this fascinating book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVD3OI5JD587C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536593#wasThisHelpful","RVD3OI5JD587C","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sight Reading"" is the story of thirty years in the lives of four people -- three musicians and an art entrepreneur -- who meet as young people in 1987, form complex romantic and professional entanglements -- and eventually emerge into middle age in the year 2007 with unresolved problems that must be addressed.The writing is excellent. The author's grasp of the insular world of classical music education, training and job searches is authentic. I just didn't find the characters very sympathetic, despite the author's beautiful and perceptive writing about them, and kept losing interest in the novel because of this.With the exception of the art entrepreneur, who takes a long time to struggle out of a divorce and find the right career, all of the main characters are phenomenally successful at very young ages in the ferociously competitive music world.They are all very good looking. No one has many health or mental problems until the last third of the book. Everyone can afford to live in homes in very pricey Boston suburbs. They fly to Europe for lectures and concerts. Their professional careers proceed very smoothly.It was hard to care about them. Compared to the vast majority of creative people, they were already so lucky and blessed, I found their complaints -- one man can't finish a symphony he's writing; one woman can't conceive a child because of her husband's low sperm count; another woman is bruised by a bad divorce -- to be trivial, compared to the difficulties experienced by the vast majority of musicians and other creative people.They had no truly compelling life struggles that would draw me in to care about them. Frankly, they seemed rather spoiled and suffering from entitlement mentality.This is a good book to give any young people you know who are planning to become musicians, but you would want to warn them that the main characters in this book represent the top 1 percent of the profession -- the musicians who won the professional lottery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PYR8ZB4JB4WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062246933#wasThisHelpful","R3PYR8ZB4JB4WJ","A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JSJUGQ3WI8MY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everlast Nutrition Fuel is nutritionally similar to the product I normally use (First Endurance EFS grape flavor). However, Everlast comes in packets which are much smaller servings than the suggested dosage size of the EFS powder. Furthermore, compared to EFS, the price of Everlast is quite high but the individual serving packets are probably partially responsible for that. Everlast tastes like orange creamsicle, orange sherbet, and Tang. The taste is pretty strong and sweet even when mixed in a 22 ounce bottle. Itâs not a bad flavor but itâs a little too strong and sweet for me. I prefer my liquid nutrition to be weaker and less sweet. Also, the sweetness of Everlast tastes artificial. Everlast also left an orange stain around the inside top of my bottle. Staining hasnât been an issue with the other liquid nutrition products Iâve tried.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAUZPX1RQ5BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7YZ7IO#wasThisHelpful","R1UAUZPX1RQ5BK","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this modem because it has slightly improved range. I think itâs the third band that has the better reach. However, Iâm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because itâs difficult and frustrating to set up and a little overpriced. Iâm fairly proficient with this sort of thing and yet I was not able to get it to work with my cable modem by following the quick setup instructions. So then I had to reconnect my old modem so that I could get online and find some other instructions (oh the irony) that did work.

"You spray this product on the water of the toilet before you go, it leaves an oily sheen and it (mostly) covers the smell. Itâs a good product to use at work or other public bathrooms. People will obviously still know what you did in there but theyâll be smelling vanilla mint  instead. However, be aware that the scent of this product is so strong that others may be just as bothered by the Poo-Pourri smell. As soon as you spray the product into the toilet the room is engulfed in the scent of the spray and it will linger for considerable time afterwards. This stuff is potent! Itâs basically just a really powerful and expensive air freshener thatâs oil based and goes on the water instead of into the air. The vanilla mint scent is pleasant but only if you donât mind a strong and unnatural smell. Iâve also tried the Rose Geranium scent and the Vanilla Mint is WAY better.

"I know it's possible to get a good bag of Erin Baker granola because I've had one before. However, I have now received two bags in a row that are stale and taste like cardboard. The other bad bag was the Fruit and Nut flavor. Both stale bags have been within a month of the expiration date so that might have something to do with it. I'm guessing that they've been sitting in an Amazon warehouse for a long time and then being shipped in a cardboard box during really hot weather doesn't help. So the fault probably lies with Amazon and not Erin Baker. Regardless of the reason, the product I tried isn't good so I have to give it a low rating.

"Iâve found that kinesio tape used during cycling helps alleviate some of my knee and neck pain. It adds support and somehow lessens the soreness in my problem areas. Because the tape is so expensive I use it sparingly, typically only for longer rides and only if Iâve been in recent pain. Iâve worn it on my knee during 60+ mile rides in the very hot and wet summer weather of SW Florida and it stays on. Normally I remove the tape after exercise and switch to a standard support band if needed. Iâve used Rock Tape, Kinesio Tex Classic, Spidertech and now KT Tape. They all work pretty much the same although the Kinesio Tex Classic had the worst staying power. KT Tape appears to have the best sticking power. But with all brands the effectiveness is relatively short lived (about 8 hours tops depending on amount of exercise, sweating, and showering). After that the supportiveness starts to break down and for maximum effectiveness itâs best to reapply fresh tape. I have also used the pre-cut version of KT Tape Pro and the advantage of the pre-cut tape is speed. You donât need scissors and if you need to apply the tape in hurry the pre-cut is obviously faster. Not having to worry about scissors is also nice for throwing some tape in your bag. The pre-cuts also come with rounded edges which stay on better and donât curl up as easily as the right-angled edges of the uncut tape. Of course you can make the edges of the uncut tape round by cutting it yourself but once again that adds time. The advantage of the uncut tape is flexibility of length and cost savings. And if youâre buying the uncut tape in large rolls such as this one, the cost savings is even larger. Also, there are times when you want a shorter or longer piece of tape than what the pre-cut provides. So which one should you buy? You pay a lot more for the pre-cut so youâll have to decide if the money is worth that. You also use more of the uncut tape because you arenât cutting exact lengths. I like having both. I keep a roll of regular tape for when I have time to cut my own which is most often and a roll of the pre-cut for when Iâm in a rush.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBDO4AZU4T6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O67XCW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBDO4AZU4T6H","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Balance Bar Bites are remarkably similar to Captain Crunch cereal in both looks, taste, and texture. Fortunately they are not similar in ingredients. The Balance Bar Bites have good ingredients and nutritional value. Eating them is a little off-putting because you feel like you should put them in a bowl and pour milk over them. Nonetheless, you quickly get used to the strangeness. The taste is very good if you like peanut butter cereal balls. However, they are much more filling than cereal. Theyâre also portable and not messy. I donât see myself eating these often but theyâre a nice snack to have on occasion to mix in with my usual routine of on-bike nutrition that mainly consists of bars, soft chews, and gels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5KMR4SMOTGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT1ZH2O#wasThisHelpful","R2E5KMR4SMOTGW","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son enjoys playing with this toy and assembly was fast and simple. He loves dropping the balls down the chutes. Heâs too young to use the elevator properly but he does still manage to push on it now and then. As far as negatives to this toy and why I didnât give it 5 stars, one is that if you hold the elevator up too long the ball can get stuck underneath it and youâll have to extricate the ball which is a little bit tricky. Also, be aware that fingers can get stuck or pinched between the elevator floor and door. This can happen more easily when two children are playing with it at the same time. What happens is that one child pulls on the elevator string when the other child has their fingers in the opening. Fortunately, no real damage occurs if this happens. Lastly, I wish they would have included more than two balls because theyâre the sort of thing that gets lost easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8PH94N7VNFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT8CG#wasThisHelpful","R2E8PH94N7VNFX","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My five-year-old has had a lot of fun with this. At first we put a house gecko in it that weâd caught. The geckos are a little more interesting that the standard brown anoles that we have everywhere around here. After a day we let him go and now we have a Betta fish in it but weâll soon be moving the fish into a proper bowl. The port, light, and magnifier are all nice features and the handle makes it easy to carry. My daughter is so far not interested in using it for bugs, frogs, or snakes but itâd be great for short-term storage and transport of  them too. There are a few negatives. For one, itâs quite small. Therefore, itâs only for temporary storage unless youâre using it for insects and even for insects I donât think youâd be able to create a permanent habitat. For almost all critters, you would only keep them in there for a day or two or use it for transport. I think the description is a little misleading in calling this a âhabitatâ. Itâs way too small for the creation of a proper habitat. Also, the port is too small to use for many critters and I wish the light used AAAâs instead of watch batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8HM0HZVFOR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGUBWW#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8HM0HZVFOR4","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The texture is a little tough but nothing so bad that itâd put me off from eating these again. The texture comes in handy when I leave it in my jersey pocket and take a long ride on a hot day.

"This diaper pail broke before weâd even put our first dirty diaper in it. It may have been damaged during shipping but I think what most likely happened is that when we were testing opening the lid I was perhaps slightly forceful when pushing the diaper-hatch-lid down and an approximately 5mm chip of plastic broke off the male piece of the locking mechanism. Unfortunately this tiny piece was important because afterwards the latch would no longer lock. Without the lock the lid stays completely and permanently open rendering the entire pail useless. Why would you make the pail almost entirely out of metal and then make a crucial component out of brittle plastic? As I said, I was maybe a little forceful when closing the lid but not so forceful that it should have broken. Being as delicate as this thing is, it would have for sure broken eventually regardless of how hard I pushed. And this shouldnât have happened in shipping either. It was well packaged. The only reason I didnât give this 1 star is that aesthetically itâs great. Itâs tall, sleek, and contemporary looking (as much as diaper pail really can be). It also has a large capacity and in theory it should be quite odor proof. However, what makes it odor-proof is a two step process that seems overly complicated for a diaper pail. When youâre hurriedly changing a messy diaper the last thing you want to bother with is two steps. You pretty much just want to drop a diaper in a can and close the lid which is where the old standby, the $25 Safety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pail excels. Save yourself a lot of money and go with that one. Weâve used it for two kids and itâs been fine.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVVJY9OR8WHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0UJ2BI#wasThisHelpful","R3OVVJY9OR8WHJ","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I installed this in an older model Ford Taurus. We rarely drive this car with our daughters - it's the ""work"" car - but as they have been riding in it more, I was looking for a more secure option than the backless booster we had been using on occasion for our five year old. She uses a seat with a five point harness in our minivan, and I had not considered a higher quality booster as a replacement. The Monterey seems MUCH safer than other boosters I have seen, largely because of the LATCH connectors that allow the seat to remain tethered to the vehicle even when the seatbelt is unbuckled. It was easy to install; reading the instructions took longer than actually putting the seat in the car. I did not have to recline the seat, as it fit firmly against the seat back in the standard position. It is a ""larger"" seat; I can't imagine having someone sit in between this seat and the other toddler seat we use. However, it's a great middle ground between a harnessed car seat and a low profile booster. The headrest and seatbelt positioner will make me feel much better about my daughter's safety. She likes the retractable cup holders and the fact that it looks like a ""big kid"" seat. I did have to extend the headrest quite a bit, but she is a very tall five year old.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20W73JSVDKYPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MQRBFE#wasThisHelpful","R20W73JSVDKYPF","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Given the option Iâd give this smoker 4 Â½ stars. I would deduct points for the poor instructions and the chipped paint. My smoker was not damaged in shipping except for a few blemishes on the paint on the front of the lid and I canât be sure the chips occurred in shipping. It almost looks like it came from the factory that way. The paint-chipping is an annoyance but nothing Iâd send this smoker back for or return to the store (if I had bought it from a store). Assembly was pretty straightforward in spite of some omissions in the instructions. The instructions also werenât very clear on how to start and operate the smoker. The instructions should have also had some better diagrams that pointed out ALL the parts. Some basic recipes and cooking instructions would have been nice too. Despite some initial frustrations in getting the smoker to smoke and the temperature dialed in I did manage to get things smoking and my first smoke turned out to be a very pleasant experience. I cooked a whole chicken and a pork loin in my first ever attempt at cooking by smoking. I used a hardwood mix of hickory, cherry, maple and apple pellets made by CookinPellets purchased from Amazon (40 lb. bag). I used water and apple juice in the steam pan, homemade rub on the pork loin, and a special chicken spice from Penzyâs. I have zero smoking experience and didnât even do much research prior to smoking this meat so I was shocked that the loin and chicken turned out so well. Iâd given myself about a 60% chance of things turning out but it was fantastic, my expectations were exceeded. The meat was tasty, moist, and tender. The pork loin had a beautiful smoke ring and the flavor really came through in the chicken. The only thing that didnât work out was that the chicken took much longer to smoke than the pork loin. I should have put the chicken on about an hour earlier so lesson learned. All in all Iâm really happy with this smoker and I think it makes smoking pretty easy. Yes you still have to monitor the smoker but youâre not totally tied to it. You can check on it like once every 45 minutes, maybe even longer. And to adjust the temp all you do is open or close the vent and adjust the temperature dial. The smoker feeds the wood automatically and you never really even need to open the lid. This smoker is big and heavy, especially when the hopper is full of pellets so I wouldnât say itâs very portable. Also, go ahead and buy at least a 20 lb. of pellets because youâll go through more of them than youâd expect. Lastly, brine your chicken (it makes a big difference), use a digital thermometer in your meat, and cook it to 5 degrees less than the recommended temperature because itâll continue to cook when you let the meat rest which you should do for about a Â½ hour.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJO555BBSWA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMAPD74#wasThisHelpful","R1YJO555BBSWA4","A3C1QYGEET3BVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C1QYGEET3BVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also works well for layering.The two pockets give you flexibility to quickly free up your hands by tossing things inside, or keep them warm. To give you an estimate of the depth of the pocket, it's as if you fully extend your five fingers and put your open hand inside (give or take).One thing of note is that the zipper does not go up too high, so if you are outside with some wind or rain, you cannot bring it all the way up to your chin.It has three tags, two up top and one on the back, towards the bottom left side. From the tags we learn this is 60% cotton and 40% polyester and made in China. The washing instructions are Machine Wash Cold, Gentle Cycle, No Chlorine, Bleach if needed, Tumble Dry Low, Cool Iron If Needed.Gifting: the item is very visible when it arrives, so you have to gift wrap it on your own or have Amazon do it.One nice touch is that when opening, it uses a tiny little pin which you can reuse, instead of using throwaway plastic thingies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDIZIY1PAFTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXISD8U#wasThisHelpful","RKDIZIY1PAFTY","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With hundreds of sitcoms out there, one would think everything was done before. But not so. Highston has the unusual premise of the protagonist being able to see and interact with celebrities in his head, while obviously no one else around him can see or hear them. In an ever increasingly complicated world, we need comedies like this! All the characters that had screen time worked for this format.I found this pilot slightly better than Red Oaks, and Red Oaks got picked up for a full season. The combination of the premise and a rotating roster of celebrities make this almost guaranteed to get picked up for a full season. Deservedly so.I don't watch celebrity reality shows and frankly I don't really care about celebrities, but within the format of this show, having celebrities mixed in works real well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2C8FQDVYOCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017APUGHO#wasThisHelpful","RC2C8FQDVYOCA","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Burberry Weekend 3.3oz (100ml) arrives in a dark blue with golden accents shiny cardboardy box. Inside there is a cardboardy base to protect the bottle. It is ready to use out of the box. The spray is enclosed completely by the stylish (in a modest way) silver cap. The spray is not removable which ensures the fragrance does not evaporate slowly. The bottle is about four inches tall with a two inch radius at the bottom.This is the Eau de Toilette (EDT). As of review time, the first picture above for the 3.3oz option says ""After Shave"". That is the wrong picture. This is not an After Shave.Very few EDTs have names that actually match their smell and are not of the grandiose trending towards the obnoxious kind. This smell is very much a weekend. A relaxing and low stress weekend, evoking perhaps a scent memory of calm days on a cloudy spring day or the early autumn with a tapestry of mildly fragrant wet leaves on the ground.I sprayed this at multiple spots at different times to test for possible reactions but had no issue at all. I also tried using too much as a test, and again, no problems. There were no complaints of overpowering smell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ZNFFY2WWR8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M5I8P6#wasThisHelpful","R5ZNFFY2WWR8P","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is useful to have for special occasions, but it maybe overkill for everyday use. Maybe when you are expecting guests or you know that your earlier meal is known ""offender"". I tried eating a variety of foods to test it, but I was not willing to eat rotten eggs to test ""extreme"" cases :) It works very well, and for regular action, you don't have to use the 3-5 sprays, maybe 1-2 are enough.The Vanilla Mist type of smell is strong to overpower the target, but not annoying like some of those obnoxious fragrance sprays. The actual list of ingredients is not provided (trade secrets?) but the container says it is natural essential oils. The package has warnings to avoid contact with eyes, do not ingest, use in ventilated area (most bathrooms have windows or fans), and choking hazards. It says Made in USA and never tested on animals.The package is full of witty puns but it's also useful. That vertical toilet paper roll actually shows you how much of the mysterious liquid is left. The spray is nicely designed, solid spraying, no finnickiness. The cover goes on with an audible click.If you are one of the very important people who's output smells like roses (you know who you are!), your roses will blend really well with this vanilla mist aroma :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJRPZWORQ0AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW25UMC#wasThisHelpful","RHJRPZWORQ0AX","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Power protectors are important in case of power troubles, but many (myself included) rarely pay a lot of attention to them. How useful you find this 6-outlet Woods depends on your setup and needs. It has six ports that span just 7 inches. So if you have power bricks or other prongs that take up space, you may not be able to fit all that you need. The plugs go in sideways, not vertically, which means in practice you can only have one big power brick (if you give it the last spot).Each one of the six ports can be individually closed. The ground is not covered, only the two power holes. When powered and all is well, the Ground light is green and the Surge light is red. These small but bright lights are always on when it has power. The power button is on the side of the thick AC power cable coming in, and it has its own red light. When installing it, make sure the power button won't be in a situation where it can be accidentally turned on/off, because it protrudes a little from the side.In addition to power, it also has an RF Input and RF Output for cable or satellite. These are on the side, and out of the way if you don't need them. Other than this and the power button, this is a solid block type of a design. It is about 10 inches long, 2.5 inches deep, and about 1.25 inches tall. The power plug is right angled and rounded, which is nice, but it takes up space if you have stacked vertical outlets (it has to be the bottom one). The power cable is thick, and about four feet long.It is packaged in a cardboardy box, half of it is covered, half of it is not. It is easy to open with fingers. Inside you have the instructions in english and spanish (tiny print on an A4 type of a page, one side per language).Since Amazon has multiple different units sharing the same Amazon page, I'm posting some of the specs from the box to make sure you are reading the right specs. It is marked for ""Multimedia"" use, indoors only, no aquariums (does not explain why not). It has max surge voltage 6000V, max spike current 60000A, response time under 1ns, EMI/RFI noise filtration < 40 dB, 100kHz -100MHz. The max connected load is 1800W. It is marked 1000 Joules and offers up to $150,000 warranty of sorts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVSTH62WVXDG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","RVSTH62WVXDG9","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Jack Links Original Chicken strips arrives in an 8x4x4 inch colorful cardboardy package (rounded measurements). Inside you will find 12 individually sealed 0.8oz packets. Each packet is roughly 8.25 x 2.25 inches. You peel it open up top (it has ""peel open"" arrows) and opens very easily. The food item itself is roughly 6.5 x 1.25 inches.Overall, I liked their taste. The scoreboard says so: I ate four of them the day they arrived. Granted, this was partly for testing purposes, so if there were any issues with them, I would notice. But the main reason I ate 4 on day #1 and another 4 on day #2 is because I liked them.The flavor reminded me of veggie BBQ faux-ribs (either Morningstar or Trader Joe, I can't find them anymore), but as if the patties were pressed down to a link. But it still has meat texture, it gets stuck in the teeth in similar fashion as chicken (since I don't have a CSI Lab, that's as close as I can get to verifying the presence of chicken in this).It is sweet and spicy, at just the right levels of sweet and spicy for my taste. Some may find it too sweet, some may find it too spicy or not spicy enough. I can only taste it as me :) It is easy to eat, there is some chewing and resistance but you don't have to ""fight it"" like dry beef jerky.The ingredients are posted on both the outer package and on the individually sealed meat sticks, but the nutritional info is only posted on the outer package: 70 calories, 6g protein, 6g carbs (5g sugars), 25mg cholesterol (8% RDA), 1g fat, 240mg sodium (10% RDA) and 2% iron and Vitamin C per strip.The main ingredients, in the order they appear on the box are chicken  (shocker, I know), brown sugar, sugar and apple sauce. The rest of the ingredients are under 2% and it includes chicken broth, oat flour, and fructose among many others.The box says ""Packaged in the USA"" and it is made from 100% recycled paper fiber.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A4C2VRA7RJRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IXRDFC#wasThisHelpful","R1A4C2VRA7RJRG","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pair of headphones grew on me. After a month of daily use, I found this to be a good choice as a bluetooth with NFC headphone that you can take with you, it is comfortable to wear for a long time (does not clamp, which means it may fall off easier, so maybe not for sports or head bobbing activities), and can also play music using a standard 3.5mm cable without power. As with many portable headphones, this is best suited for non-quiet places on the go, and not a good match if you are listening to audiophile classical music or for studio work or music practice.General- bluetooth can be very practical and convenient but if you don't need bluetooth, as a general rule of thumb, for the same money, you can get a better wired non-bluetooth headphone- sound is slightly different on bluetooth vs audio input- can play music from a standard 3.5mm audio cable even if the battery is out of juice- I did not find anything objectionable to the sound signature while listening to various modern music genres (I rarely listen to classical/jazz)- however, I did not like the sound when connected to a Casio music keyboard (I prefer a bigger around the ear headphones for that)- good isolation for its size (blocking outside sounds) but it does not silence the outside world- if you are not listening to quiet music, it covers up most of the outside sounds- very little leakage (others able to hear your music) in non-quiet places (eg coffee shops)- the earcups fold flat which is nice for transportation- the headphones do not fold- I carried them around in a soft bag in backpacks and bags for about a month and they are fine (making sure I put them in safe/padded parts of the bags)Cable Matters- has removable flat cable with one button and a volume slider (not volume buttons)- volume slider works with all devices, not just smartphones and tablets- volume slider handy for quickly muting- caution however not to bump volume slider higher if already listening at high volume from music source- the button works as play/pause and depending on device/app combo, as next and previous track (double and triple click)- the shirt clip can cause cable tangles, so if you don't need it, it is removable- can play audio via 3.5mm while charging via microUSB- putting a 3.5mm cable in it, automatically turns off the bluetooth connection- cannot play both 3.5mm audio and bluetooth at the same time (one or the other)- works with random 1/4"" adapters (not included)Battery and Power- on bluetooth, at low battery, there is an annoying loud beep every minute (every 60 seconds)- the loudness of the beep depends on the headphones volume- as a workaround, lower the headphone volume, and increase the volume of your source device- at this low volume settings, I got around 40 minutes of power before it shut off, with 40 lovely beeps :)- battery power and charging time (via microUSB) were about as expected (I didn't measure them, but they did not surprise me either way)Turning it ON/OFF- a bit goofy- first you turn the power slider on the right earcup (ON or OFF positions, hard to read without enough light)- then you press the play/connect button on the left earcup- 4 seconds puts it in connection mode (blinking blue light)- 6 seconds puts it in pairing mode (party lights - blinking blue and red)- even while in pairing mode, it can detect previously connected to devices, and connect to them without re-pairing- when the bluetooth connection is disconnected from phone/tablet, you can either turn off the power (right earcup) or let it blink for about 10 minutes, and turns off on its own- if you let it turn off on its own, you can reconnect later by just pressing the play/connect button for 4 seconds (without also having to turn on the power on the right earcup)- I don't know if this significantly affects battery life, but if you find two buttons turn-on annoying, you have a choiceBluetooth related- connected and worked fine with Android 5.x (Nexus and OEM), 4.4 (Galaxy, Moto), iPod Touch, Windows 8.1 laptop, and Lumia Windows Phone- also worked with a bluetooth keyboard also connected and used by the tablet (no interference)- pairing and connections were generally fine (there was only one corner in one coffee shop that have playback hickups)- as long devices are not fighting over it (eg two previously paired smartphones with bluetooth turned on), it connects smoothly- bluetooth audio continues to play music while charging but there is a constant hum (that's when those super long USB charging cables come in handy)- when you reach the Maximum volume, there is an annoying loud beep (very stupid)- when you reach the Minimum volume, there is a low volume non-annoying double beep- the buttons on the headphones only work with a bluetooth connection (they do not work when playing music through the cable)- remembers multiple previously connected device (I didn't count)NFC related- NFC pairing worked successfully every time- the NFC area is the outside of the left earcup- NFC cannot ""steal"" an active/live Bluetooth connection with another device- NFC connected while the phone was in a solid plastic case (I don't have any thick cases to test those)In The Box- the headphones- the audio cable- the microUSB charging cable- instructions in many languages but very small font and very small diagrams- nothing else is included (no case/bag, no 1/4"" adapter)- has material smell out of the box when you stick your nose to the earpads but it goes away quickly- lots of protective tape on the headphones","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NK9ETC8VEOZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W98RIX8#wasThisHelpful","R2NK9ETC8VEOZE","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a promising new scifi TV series, taking place in space, in a different world. Two former Stargate writers have created this project (first as a comic book), and you can see some Stargate elements in the show, and some former Stargate actors make guest appearances, but it's not a Stargate-type of a show.The idea is clever, it has multiple undercurrents of mystery to hook you through and make you keep watching. This is in space, a rarity these days among TV shows. The characters are mostly interesting, the actors are doing a decent job, and overall, given the budget, this is a very watchable show, and has the potential to get a lot better in season 2.This is not a high budget show, so you can't expect an HBO level production. But with only 13 episodes, the stories are more focused and they don't have to resort to clip-shows to make the budget work.Because of the various mysteries and twists, if you are interested in watching it, make sure you avoid spoilers if you can. It will make it more fun. There are multiple revelations throughout the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YBCPO4VQ12KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJTAJ7G#wasThisHelpful","R2YBCPO4VQ12KT","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After about 2.5 months of daily use, this strange-looking keyboard turned out better than I expected. It is still not a perfect keyboard, but despite the funky shape and monster size, it is comfy on the wrists, and if your hands are properly aligned for touch-typing, you can do quite well touch-typing. It is a bit unforgiving if you misalign your hands for touch-typing purposes. The typing angle is pretty good, even though your hands are going a bit downhill.One pitfall for first time users, the F-Lock button (on the right of the F12) toggles the function keys between their standard functions and different functions assigned by Microsoft. If for example the F3 or F5 are not behaving as expected, just press the F-Lock and all will be well again. I found out the hard way :)There are many extra buttons, and there is customization and Microsoft software/firmware to install and tweak if you wish. The most unusual placements (but can be handy) are left/right arrows below the space-bar, a zoom button above the space bar, and a dedicated calculator button above Scroll Lock. Of the extra keys, these are the ones I have been using the most .Keypad, arrow keys, Home/End, Ctrl/Shift/Alt are all working well and have not caused me frustration.It arrives in a monster red Microsoft box, it is a big keyboard after all. It has two feet on the front that can tucked away if not needed. This is a USB-powered keyboard, no power needed. At its longest, it is around 20 x 11 inches, and at its tallest it is about 2.5 inches tall (with the feet up).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TR3M68DZG9TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A6PPOK#wasThisHelpful","R1TR3M68DZG9TN","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
