"I have been using this water bottle for a couple of weeks now. I have put it in my bag, backpack, purse, and briefcase and it has not leaked once. For me that is a key feature as I deal with a lot of paper and I do not want to get them wet. Obviously!It keeps my water cold old day long. It has a good carrying handle. It is a bit small so you can only carry it by one to two fingers or hook it from your backpack or other bag. The spout is ideal and has a cover that flips. The autoseal button easy to use. No need to press extra hard.The water bottle is made of stainless steel which, although more durable, makes dents more visible. Believe me, this is not my first stainless steel bottle. I tend to give rough treatment to my water bottles and have had a couple fall of the top of my car (oops), fall out of my pack whilst hiking (overs stones) and other accidents. Nalgene bottles were nearly indestructible until they met me, and then I broke my within a month.So, I threw out my last stainless steel bottle and am now using this Contigo one. I will update the review as time (and dings) goes on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LG715YRT8MKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNXD1A#wasThisHelpful","R3LG715YRT8MKF","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:34 Mins This is a great product. The sheets are useful and practical. They can be use in almost any surface, even brick! I tried using this product in a variety of surfaces, glass, metal, wall, etc. When I looked at my bick wall I said to myself ""surely not...""  But, I was wrong, it adhered to the brick wall. It wasn't a smooth surface to write on, but it still worked.I used different colored dry erased markers (black, blue red). All worked very well. But, the red was hard to erased and left visible red stains in the paper. So, I suggest you stick with black and blue.This is a great useful product. The uses for this are limited by your imagination. I can see this being a very useful produc tin places where boards are hard to come by or impractical to use.Great great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCV6T32ZMHCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPOJGS6#wasThisHelpful","R1VCV6T32ZMHCB","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very thorough backpack. It has pockets everywhere to cleary fit most of your electronic needs (laptop, phone, tablet, chargig cables, etc) whilst still making room for the important incidentals (your helmet, etc). The backpack straps are Comfy and provide food back support.The backpack is very well designed and perfect for a student but for one issue. The pack itself is to heavy. After several years of grad school during which I had to carry my laptop everyday, I know for a fact that I am not looking for a backpack that is heavy enough to add weight to my back. If this backpack were a bit lighter it would be great.This might be good for travelers but it is a bit too bulky for my travels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LVSV8P3ZFWLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHNPPXK#wasThisHelpful","R3LVSV8P3ZFWLY","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, I had a game night. We started with this game and my guests grew bored. Very very bored. You never want a game night to be boring!First of all the instructions are ... well they don't translate well into the game actually is. You have to play the game a couple of times before actually getting it and I am still sure that we were doing something wrong.We played as per the instructions. We played about 4 rounds. The game itself is tedious at best, and absolutely boring on its own. As one of my guests explained, ""the only part I liked was when we were making up stories.""  And that is the crux of the issue.

"Juliet is a bright, straight A student. Lucas is an average student that dreams of being in the military, just like his forefathers before him. These two never really paid much attention to each other until one day Lucas looks at Juliet like he knows her. And then, he insists that he remembers her, remembers being with her. It scares her when his ""memories"" start being all too accurate. Time travel? Out of body experience? Etc... It doesn't really matter, this is a story about the first love, the ever lasting presence of it, the permanence of it. This is one of those books that makes us question, 'if only I have stuck it out, would it have been the one?'I am of two differing opinions about this book and it took me a while to get to this review because of this very fact. On the one hand, the story was well written. Catheen Davitt Bell is a good story teller. She has written a book that draws you in and makes you become invested in the characters. Throughout the entire book I was rooting for them just because their emotions were so well written into the book that it made me all the more invested in a good outcome. This book on audio is amazing. But, only distance and time have made me realize how little growth these characters went through in this book. Jeez, I don't even know, I keep changing my mind between loved it and meh.I will go with my original perception of what a great story. It was so well written and it kept me interested.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGO2KWQKJOLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385754558#wasThisHelpful","R1LGO2KWQKJOLQ","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite an effective self defense devise. First of all, fits well as a key chain. The monkey fist is wrapped in 550 paracord which can be used in  emergencies. This can be used as part of your bug out bag or your daily key chain.  I cannot use it because I go to federal buildings often. But it is nice to keep in the car.I was able to test some minor impact by the monkey fist by mistake, Ouch! It hurts! I lost control of the key chain and it landed on my clavicle. So, this is not for fun or for minors.Take care when using this.

"This is a good combo set to have. You have your super and regular tampons and also liners thrown in the mix to cover all your bases.

"I have very oily skill so I have to be careful what I use. I mostly use Clean & Clear and Clinique products. I tend to break out during my period so I was looking forward to testing this. I can't quite say it helped. But, it did not make things worse.the moisturizer is very lightweight and smells really nice. I don't know that I want my face product to have a scent though. It is added chemicals and something else to compete with my perfume. I prefer if this was scent free.It feels ok in the morning but it has no SPF.

"I welcomed this headboard as I had needed one for a long time. I knew some assembly was needed and I did assemble it somewhat successfully. The assembly was not bad but I still have a few screws left...I have no idea where they go. I did also suffer a blister in my hand from all the screws I had to tighten. There were a lot of parts to this headboard.First, this is not solid wood, it is more like pressed wood. It is low quality wood. Moreover, the color was not actually painted or stained. It is more like a film placed over it. There was chipping all over the headboard. I guess it does not travel well.Second, the headboard I received is nothing like the one pictured. It is grey and has 2 fabric panels. It looks quite nice at first glance (see picture). I looked through all the products that the Ameriwood company offers here on Amazon and I was not able to find the one I received. I also looked through their website and did not find it either.My concern really is about its durability and stability. I am afraid I am going to break it when being with my significant other. I can just imagine saying, ""we broke the bed!"" But, it wouldn't be such a feat as this is likely to occur with the tamest of movements. I am even wary of reclining back in the bed to read. It is not stable at all and it moved. The screws that attach the bed frame to the headboard, whilst big, don't really attach very well.  The holes int he bed frame don't really match up with the ones in the headboard. I was only able to attach the top 2 ones. The bottom two had no place to go. Maybe my bed is too low. I am going to have to drill them in. As it stands, I am sure this is to be broken on the first try. Maybe I need to drill the headboard to the wall!So, although this is good for the guest room (for celibate guests!), it is not going to last very long.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZ3KOB4UJHJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5WL08W#wasThisHelpful","R2LZ3KOB4UJHJZ","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This safe replaces another flimsier (Homegear brand) safe of similar size.SIZE and BOLTING DOWN. I would not call this X-Large at all. This is a semi-large safe.

There are options to bolt this down, just be sure to follow the instructions. The safe is smaller on the inside than one would think looking at the outside. The reason for this is the water and fire protection. There is a lot of ""padding"" (if we can call it that) to protect from fire and water (up to a degree).  IF you bolt down the safe, the water proof goes poof.EASE OF USE. The safe comes with a master code and you can also set up the user code.WARRANTY AND INSURANCE. This is the best part of this safe.

"I have had several small Bluetooth speakers throughout the years. To date, my absolute favorite is the Simple Audio Go Compact Rechargeable Bluetooth Speaker and this is the speaker to which I measure all others. It is still the speaker I use every single day and take on every vacation.These little speakers are designed to just grab and go. You take it with you to the park, on vacation, with your laptop, to the backyard ... the possibilities are endless.I really like this speaker. In comparison to my Simple Audio Go, the Go wins in sound but this HP Roar is a good option as well.Let's start with the SIZE: This speaker has a triangular shape and it is very small (3x3 inches). It sure packs good sound for the size. The speaker fits in your hand easily. The speaker has two thin line grip strips at the bottom so that it won't slide off easily.PAIRING: Pairing took seconds. It was very simple and my phone recognized it immediately.ACCESSORIES: The speaker comes with a USB cable. It also comes with a carrying case.SOUND: This speaker system sounds great for the size. The sound quality is very good. It is not a Bose system and doesn't have great base but it works great if your intended use is a grab and go speaker. This is great for outside for carrying it around the house. I listened to music and audiobooks. The audio book sound was clear. I had it on the loudest setting at all times.SPEAKERPHONE: The speakerphone is a nice feature and it is now near-norm to include it with a bluetooth speaker. Sound is ok and didn't have any issues.BATTERY LIFE: The specs state that it lasts 28 hours on one charge and I am still testing that. I will update as soon as I finish the testing. If so, that battery life far surpasses any of the speakers I have ever had.RANGE: The range is about 25 feet, depending on the interference (doors, walls, furniture).PACKAGING: The speaker comes in a clear box.This is a good speaker at a great price. This is the speaker that you jsut grab and take it to the park, picnic, backyard, etc. You can carry it with you around the house as you do chores. Use it for your office, car, etc. It is very easy to carry around and it comes with a pouch. It is a bit heavy but not overly so. A little over a pound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PX769HHJCU5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVV140K#wasThisHelpful","R1PX769HHJCU5Z","AFFVUZEGP1FDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice looking laminated map. It is a fun and interesting map with colorful drawings that pique the interest of young and adult minds alike.This map is better suited for children. It is a conversation piece and can lead to further geography talks.It has a few drawbacks.

"I actually like that this granola isn't as sweet as some of the other store brands I've tried in the past.  This granola isn't heavy handed on the raisins, which helps keep the sweetness factor low; they are after all just little sugar globes XD.Personally, I wasn't a fan of the rice puffs; although I do like puffed rice cereal on its own.  I thought their texture didn't do well in contrast to the granola once submerged in milk; the little rice pieces went soft and kind of chewy, quickly.  I could enjoy one or the other (granola or rice) but not both combined...The box is definitely gimmicky but I do like that it doesn't take up a lot of space on top of my refrigerator; where I keep other random odds and ends (paper towels, cereals, small appliances, etc...).  I also like that it's easy to close and it just looks 'tidy' - it really appeals to my OCD self.  Aside from that, I can't really see myself dropping $8 for this box of granola.  It tastes ""Ok"", there's not a whole lot of product, and I would be more satisfied with a lower price point in exchange for a less fancy cereal box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H131BUMZ0P77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTYCYW0#wasThisHelpful","R3H131BUMZ0P77","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially, I thought that Nespresso was both an espresso and coffee machine and so I was a little disappointed to learn that this would not be replacing my coffee maker.  However, I'm definitely in love with this espresso maker.  It's so simple to use and it I absolutely LOVE the espresso that it makes.  It has earned a coveted permanent spot on my very limited countertop.The Lattissima Touch is super easy to use and the optional milk carafe can be stored in the fridge and comes apart with ease for cleaning.  I initially tried to make a cappuccino with Almond Milk and it sorta worked but... I wouldn't recommend it; it did not taste very good at all.  I then tried whole milk, which foamed up wonderfully and tasted great.  The directions suggest using skim milk for the best foam but I'm content with sticking to whole out of a personal preference.  I don't see myself using the milk carafe often but it's a nice option to have for house guests who prefer a little steamed milk in their drink.I bought glasses, as shown in the image and sold separately, to go with my Nespresso.  The pre-programmed drinks don't quite fill up the glasses as much as I'd like or think that they should.  As an example, the middle button on the left draws a shot of espresso that is about 1.3 or 1.4 ounces (I forget off the top of my head); so not quite a single or a double shot if I understand correctly.  The glasses I have are definitely meant to hold 2 ounces with some room to spare for sugar/stirring if desired.  There is a way that you can change the volume of steamed/foamed milk and espresso that is drawn.  The directions for this are outlined in the instructions manual but I haven't experimented with it just yet - I'm all out of pods :)If you're looking for a quality, no-fuss/effortless espresso machine - this is it!  I would highly recommend this to my own family and friends and think this would make an amazing gift for anyone special in your life (presuming they love Espresso of course!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLWHP6WTZ10H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI44UU6#wasThisHelpful","RMLWHP6WTZ10H","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The presentation is beautiful; I love the large oversized tin and will certainly find another use for it once I'm through all the soft creme caramels.  ""IF"" I ever get through all the soft creme caramels!I truly thought I'd love this, especially since I've always been a caramel (not chocolate) girl but these were somewhat disappointing.  Something about the Lancaster brand and logo made me think I was getting old fashioned candy made the old fashioned way but one taste and you can't help but realize that 'something is off'.  Far too sweet and artificial tasting.  As it turns out, these don't actually contain much, if any, caramel making ingredients (butter, sugar, cream, salt) or any ingredients that would suggest it was made in the tradition of an old fashioned candy.In all fairness, upon closer inspection, these aren't actually advertised as caramels.  They're ""Soft Cremes"", whatever that's supposed to be, that are flavored to taste like caramel.  Not sure if that actually makes this any better though.  Perhaps I just don't have a proper palate for soft creme candy.All in all, I give this a 3 star rating.  The tin is lovely and would make an acceptable gift; better if the candies were equally as nice.  The plain caramel flavored ones are the best in my opinion, whereas the caramel butterscotch and caramel vanilla flavored ones start to taste artificial.  All of them are far too sweet for my liking and perhaps could have been balanced out with a touch of salt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0VTXRS36KC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","R2T0VTXRS36KC6","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love the texture/feel of this balm; leaves skin feeling silky soft and smooth.  Although it's not a moisturizer per se; I do think this does have some moisturizing qualities.  It's been fine on its own but a light moisturizer layered over it on top during our cooler/dryer months will probably be needed.As for the scent; I have neutral feelings about it.  I would describe it as a masculine, herbal/medicinal scent; however, my boyfriend did not like it at all and won't use it (which is why it's become my light summer time moisturizer).  I rather like the fragrance but wish it wasn't so strong a scent; it certainly is not subtle and it does not fade all that quickly.

"These dishtowels are smaller than your standard sheet of paper towel and are cardboard stiff (like a dried out sponge) until you add water. They do not expand in width or length or dimension; they're just like very thin dish sponges.Calling these dishcloths are a bit of a stretch.  It would not make sense to trade in your regular dish sponge or traditional dishcloth for these.  You'd be very limited in what dishes/cooking utensils you could clean with this product (not enough friction/cleaning power), nor could you hang them to dry hands (far too stiff) or lay them out on a counter top to rest dishes on to dry (far too tiny).That said, I do find these great for wiping down my stove top and kitchen counters after I'm done cleaning (the other one is kept upstairs for wiping down my bathroom sink area).  They fill a small niche use in my home that was once a job reserved for 'paper towels'.  Although this may seem insignificant a use, it did shed some light on how wasteful my paper towel use has been.  I used to go through at least a roll a week and that has definitely changed for the better.These 'dishtowels' are definitely going to save me some money and make me feel a little more environmentally friendly in the process but I do think these should be rebranded as a paper towel substitute.  I don't see myself running out to stock up on these as they fill such a small purpose in my home BUT I will definitely repurchase them after these are no longer useable due to wear/tear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90Y15ATJ9R5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PI7Z8#wasThisHelpful","R90Y15ATJ9R5K","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of my favorite prints by Banksy :)My only qualm with this print ,which is really more so with the seller, is that the images provided are somewhat deceptive.  The images are of the same print but of a different sized product.  Unless they include the option to purchase the larger print on this page, they shouldn't include an image of their large print canvas spanning across a 5-seat sofa (or they should place a very visible disclaimer that this is not the item for sale).  It's reasonable to assume that some buyer's will look to these images for a visual representation of how this print will look to scale in their home.Regardless, I do love this print and I like that it's a zoomed in on just the girl and balloon.  The canvas is nice and the frame is well constructed.  I did receive hardware to hang this one; though I chose to use my own method for hanging (3m hanging strips).  As for the value of what you receive, I personally think the price is a bit steep but I tend to think that prints are generally overpriced to begin with.

"Very stylish water bottle with a built in and functional carabiner clip.I'm just about in love with all things Contigo (specifically their travel mugs) and this water bottle has all of the features I could possibly want and more.  I especially like the option to lock the autospout, so you don't have to worry about it accidently flipping open while being jostled around in a bag.This is a very well made water bottle and a lot of thought was put into its design; all the way down to the straw that screws into the lid (as opposed to most water bottles that would simply use pressure to hold the straw in place).The only thing I didn't care for about this water bottle is the shape of the spout (it's like drinking from a sippy cup) and the accompanying noise while drinking from this bottle.  In all fairness, I realize that this probably would not be leak proof with a regular straw shaped mouth piece and the noise is only an issue if you plan on using this water bottle in an office setting.

"I really like this conditioner, though I have to say that I'm not too fond of the fragrance, which smells a little reminiscent of a perfume my grandmother used to wear, but it's light enough and rinses away easily enough not to be annoyed by it.Overall; this really leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable; really soft!  For reference, I have pin straight, fine (but lots of it), long hair.  Conditioner is a must for me to prevent breakage and to keep my hair from looking stringy/scraggly between brushings yet at the same time, it can be difficult to find one that doesn't weigh my hair down and leave it looking limp and oily.  So far, I've been really impressed at how my hair looks and feels since I've started using this.

"I really like this shampoo, from the product all the way down to the packaging, though this is something I'd probably have passed on while shopping.  I don't know why but as a woman in her mid-thirties, the last thing I want to toss in my shopping cart is a product that suggests I need or want a ""Youth Boost"" :D.  Perhaps I'm just not the target demographic.The one star deduction is more or less for the formulation and fragrance.  I like a shampoo that suds a bit because it makes it easier for me to use less product in order to clean my hair.  Non-sudsy shampoo, while I understand is less harsh and cleans just as well, requires me to use a ton more product in order to wash my hair properly.  Long hair, when wet, is difficult to run your fingers through your scalp in order to distribute shampoo unless there's some suds to help lift the hair up at the root.  As for the fragrance, it's not offensive or strong, but it does remind me a little bit of a fragrance my grandmother once wore twenty-some years ago.

"Okay...  Opening the box, I was a little underwhelmed.  I didn't think these looked very nice and one of the earrings had a visible defect (like little bumps) that slightly marred the polished silver look.  Removing these earrings from the box also had me concerned because that's when I also realized that the curved posts are extremely soft/bendable; in other words, these earrings feel cheap.The reason for my 5 star review?  Well... they simply look stunning on.  These are seriously the most flattering drop earrings I've ever worn.  They're just the right length - not too long or too short and they really flatter my jaw and neckline.  For this price, I can overlook the fact that these perhaps aren't the greatest quality.  They're cute and flirty earrings that will dress up virtually any outfit.  If I lost these, I could see myself purchasing a second pair.***Edit***Had to drop these down to one star :(  I loved them soooo much and had set them aside to wear for an upcoming weekend trip well...  the day of my trip, I went to put them on (no problem) and then I went to put the backstops on and the earring literally broke into two pieces.  I'd have been willing to leave this a 4 star review if it had broken as a result of me fussing to get the backstop on as I knew the metal was notably soft when I had tried them on the first time; however, I never even got so far as to touch the backstop to the back of the earring.  I was just feeling around with my free hand for the point of the earring when it broke and dropped to the ground; there was virtually no pressure applied whatsoever.  I could not recommend these earrings at all knowing that they break so easily and although they're inexpensive and I loved how they looked on me, I wouldn't purchase a replacement.

There is a red decorative CFF trim on both sides of the bar and the ends of the bar doesn't have the black and white logo shown in the picture, but rather an American flag image with a CFF overlay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNQVT2N9LAJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOWLOZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3DNQVT2N9LAJ4","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought these were very well made t-shirts.  The material seems a little thin, which isn't horrible if worn as an undershirt, and has a reasonable weight to it.  Unfortunately, these were much, much bigger than I was expecting them to be.  My SO normally wears a size M in shirts but he was practically swimming in these; I definitely should have sized down.  They're a bit wide in the shoulders and are extremely long.  I get that they're meant to 'stay fit' when tucked in but unless you're tall, it's just too much material if you fall on the shorter side of the height spectrum (as we both do).Since they're too big for him to wear, I've been using them as night shirts and they're perfect in that regard.  They're very soft and comfy to sleep in.  They hit me about mid-thigh and I'm 5'4"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPLJ3KTTZKLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTV8ISK#wasThisHelpful","R2HPLJ3KTTZKLL","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the idea of this Veggie and Herb kit and was super excited to receive this; so much so that I went out and purchased a raised garden bed by Greenes (review to come) to start a modestly small garden :)Unfortunately, I've come to realize a little too late that I either don't have a green thumb or these pods are mostly duds.  About half of them never even sprouted :(  Additionally, I didn't realize that they only contained one plant per potter but I suppose that makes sense for spacing purposes.  For some reason, I thought there would be a few seeds per pod.I think these pods might be good if you just want a few small veggies or herb plants to keep in planters but if you're looking to start even a modestly small garden, you'd be better off purchasing seeds or plants that have already been started (which is what I'm going to end up doing since it's already late in the season)","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3Z003VKYYI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P99KHUU#wasThisHelpful","R1W3Z003VKYYI8","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm extremely satisfied with this product.  I know there are quite a few negative reviews that have been written about this product containing sugar as a sweetener but for me, that's a positive.  I was explicitly searching for a flavored, protein supplement from a reputable seller that did not contain stevia or some form of artificial sweetener.Since I use this to supplement my protein needs in my already healthy diet and because I have a very active lifestyle; the super small, negligible amount of sugar that this adds to my day is not even worth batting an eye at.  I love that this product isn't cloyingly sweet; I can actually drink this :)One scoop with 8 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk is my go to mix and equals a whopping 25g protein and only 160 calories.

"Received 2, 1 oz samples of these with my June 2015 PopSugar Must Have box.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I woke up this morning feeling a little dehydrated from the night before (celebrated the start of the weekend a little too hard...); coupled with a 3 hour long fitness class and I was feeling rather miserable.  Water alone just wasn't cutting it.I tore into the sour gummies and they really did hit the spot; along with more water...  Feeling much better.  They did leave a bit of weird after-taste and I'm not sure if it's the candy itself or the sour flavoring.  I'll know after I try the berry flavored ones but I don't plan on touching them anytime soon.In hindsight, I probably could have done just as well with a bottle of gatorade but these just happened to be on hand and didn't require a trip to the store.  They definitely win over a sports drink in terms of size and you could easily store a box of these in your cupboard and toss a pack in your purse or gym bag as needed (aside from my water bottle and shaker bottle for the occasional protein shake, I don't really want to lug around an electrolyte drink for the rare occasion where I feel it would benefit me).I would definitely purchase these just to keep a few on hand but I'm going to wait until I've tried the berry ones to see if I like the flavor of those better.  Overall; I think these are reasonable as a quick electrolyte fix and although they have 15 grams of sugar, I for one appreciate that it's actual sugar and not some artificial sweetener.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY16832CL17HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPP3XFK#wasThisHelpful","RY16832CL17HZ","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to give this a 5 star review although I think the design/colors are horrid, lol.  I think the apple and pear design is the only one I really like but then again, style is highly subjective.The 5 star review is because this is a very nice, high quality kitchen towel and assuming all of their other designs are made equally as well, I would definitely recommend this to friends/family.  Unlike the last set of kitchen towels that I received where the design was printed/stamped onto the fabric, the fabric on this towel has been dyed in order to create the desired image.  The fabric remains soft and absorbent on both sides.  Overall, this is a generously sized kitchen towel and feels luxurious to touch.  My only complaint is that I do think $8 is a bit pricey for one kitchen towel, no matter how well made.  I'd be more likely to consider purchasing these if they came in packages of 2 at a slightly discounted price (ex: 2 for $14.99).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20JPAEUOKRH96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABS3NU#wasThisHelpful","R20JPAEUOKRH96","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who purchases their bath tissue on price/affordability alone because...  toilet paper is toilet paper, right?  Well I stand corrected.  I honestly didn't expect this to be any different or better than my store brand and I primarily chose this product because I knew I'd make use of it eventually.  Now that I've used it, I can honestly say that this is truly an ultra plush, luxurious bath tissue and it's FAR superior to what I have been using.  It makes my store brand bath tissue seem on par with the flimsy tissue we use in our office restrooms :-/.I actually DO have a preference now for this bath tissue over the one I have been purchasing and would consider purchasing this over my store brand.  Whether or not I will depends on how much more it costs over my current brand.

"Very cute and my niece absolutely loves playing with these.  She's recently taken an interest to origami but it's still a little too complex for her tiny hands to master; this AmiGami set has helped satiate her interest and is much easier for her to play with and create!The only thing I wish this set came with was some sort of carrying case for everything to be stored in though a giant ziplock bag works just fine.  Since there are other figures that can be purchased, it might be nice if Mattel offered official carrying cases for these.

"This is a beautifully made Children's Cookbook and definitely gift worthy for any young, aspiring chef (heck - I love this cookbook!)  The recipes are easy to follow and each come with pictures of the finished dish.  Different cooking techniques are also covered in detail and most of the recipes also include pictures to demonstrate the step by step instructions along the way.On a side note...  If your child can't operate small or basic kitchen appliances on their own with supervision, I'd highly recommend ""Kids Cooking: A Very Slightly Messy Manual"" as the recipes are designed to split up tasks between the adult/parent and child.  This cookbook assumes your child can perform certain tasks that very young cooks may not be able to perform.  You could take it upon yourself to partition these tasks yourself, but your young cook might get bored watching you perform most of the tasks since these recipes are a bit more sophisticated.  This cookbook would be ideal for children who can do at least one or more of the following with supervision: use sharp knives, use the stove/oven, and/or operate small kitchen appliances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAWYLDYM9XRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465435468#wasThisHelpful","RKAWYLDYM9XRJ","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a fan of strongly scented air fresheners or floral scents in general but this is quite lovely.  The best way I can describe shimmer would be a light floral with a hint of sweetness to it.

Perfect for refreshing my house after cooking foods that tend to linger in the air longer than you want, such as fish and fried foods.

"Love this polish!  So cute and perfect for summer :)  I normally shy away from sparkle infused polishes; not because I'm perhaps pushing that boundary of being too old to wear sparkles... but because they can be a real pain in the rear when it comes to application.  I did need several coats in order to get the look that I wanted but this was still several coats less than my other sparkly polish that I purchased last summer.  You'll definitely want a top coat for this, otherwise it'll be a bit rough to the touch.

"These are nice but perhaps a bit overpriced IMO at about $5 a towel.  They're thin and the design is stamped onto the fabric with some sort of paint product as opposed to the fabric being dyed; so the design is rough to the touch, doesn't assist with absorbency, and will chip/fade when washed.  They are made out of cotton, so care should be taken when washing in order to avoid shrinking.For decorative purposes, they'll do just fine but they're not so great for drying hands or dishes with unless you flip them inside out and use the non-patterned side.  Overall, they're cute but I'd only feel good about buying these if they were about $3 max per towel (or) $12 for 4 given their quality.

I wasn't too thrilled about that, lol) but after a couple of days of it sitting out he did eventually eat it.  The second one he ate after just a day or two and now he literally does backflips when I ask if he wants a ""treat"" and inhales them in less than a minute.

While the hose sprayer bottle is convenient for taking care of large surface areas; it's just not ideal for me based on the layout of my yard and where my garden hose can reach.  I would definitely purchase this if it was sold as a concentrate that you could dilute yourself and add to a pressure-pump style sprayer.Overall, it works and it won't kill other nearby ornamental plants like bleach/water will.

"I once owned an xshot (and probably still do... I just for the life of me can't remember where I put it) that I absolutely loved!  Since I had a mini-vaca coming up and wanted a selfie stick to bring along for group photos with friends, I was thrilled to find this in my queue - perfect timing!While this is definitely a well made product and for my intended use, it certainly did its job - this was probably a bit overkill and at $50, wayyy to expensive.  In its collapsed form, it was also much larger/bulkier than I had envisioned.  This isn't something you just toss in your purse unless you're sporting an oversized bag.  I think for the average person, operating a compact point and shoot camera, a less expensive, less bulky version of this is all you're going to want or need.If you're a more serious photographer and you plan on balancing a really expensive camera on the end of a 'stick' - this beast of a monopod is probably what you'll want and I'm guessing you probably won't mind dishing out 50 shells for something that's sturdy enough to safely secure your cam.

"I agree with the advice provided in this book but it did occur to me that I had read this advice before in ""Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking when Stakes are High"".  Both books approach a similar strategy for creating a win/win situation, building and strengthening relationships and, in the process, eliminating fighting along the way.  However, it's my personal opinion that Crucial Conversations does a better job at providing the reader with the tools needed in order to take this knowledge and apply it in real life.The three stars is because I 100% agree with the advice that's presented in this book and I know that it works because I've applied these very same concepts to my relationships at work, at home, with family and friends.  Make no mistake about it; it takes a lot of work and commitment to start applying these changes to your behavior and how you interact with others but the results speak for themselves.  Long-term, it becomes easier and easier to address perceived conflicts from a place of love, understanding, and mutual respect.The two star deduction is because even though I was nodding my head in agreement as I read through this book, I realized that I was filling in a lot of knowledge gaps on the how-to aspect of applying these changes from the Crucial Conversations book.  I'm not ashamed to admit it... I need a LOT of hand holding when it comes to applying new concepts and I simply thought that C.C. did a better job in that regard.The other reason why I took a star deduction is because I felt the use of bible quotes was a bit heavy handed and for the most part, added little to no value besides taking up page space.  I am Christian and do appreciate a well-placed bible quote as much as any other well-placed quote.  When used sparingly, I think they can offer a welcome pause and some mindful thinking/self reflection amongst a tome of text.  Unfortunately, they were overused in this book and I felt they ultimately took away from the overall message being presented.  Sometimes less is more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3062WMDN5AP2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426773854#wasThisHelpful","R3062WMDN5AP2B","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very particular about my conditioners since I have baby fine, pin straight hair that is easily weighed down and will show any amount of product buildup quickly as limp, stringy locks.  At the same time, my long locks can't forgo conditioner altogether, otherwise it turns into a tangled mess.I'm very satisfied with this conditioner in that it does a great job at conditioning my hair, without weighing it down.  It has a very mild scent and I like the color; pale green, that makes me think of avocados :0).The front of the bottle indicates that it's a ""plant based bottle"" and for some reason that's a bit of a turnoff for me.  It seems gimmicky and I suppose it makes me think that the manufacturer is promoting the packaging rather than the product and that it's an indirect way of saying ""our product itself is meh but...

"I was really excited about receiving this product but after giving it a whirl, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of those novelty appliances that will take up space and rarely be used (at least in my household).The air-fryer appealed to me because I try and maintain a healthy diet free of most processed/convenience foods.  I was sold on the idea of being able to enjoy some home-made fried foods without all of the excess oil.  Needless to say, I was disappointed to later learn that this appliance is primarily for heating pre-fried, frozen, convenience foods (in other words: frozen chicken nuggets, frozen onion rings, frozen french fries, frozen pizza logs, etc...),  In fact, the instructions are written primarily for these frozen convenience foods - with times for cooking these various items, including 'frozen pizza logs' printed along the top of the appliance.  In my opinion, this is akin to battering your own foods, deep frying it in oil, then reheating your leftovers in this appliance and declaring it 'healthier' in comparison to the batch that came straight from the fryer.If you're looking to make 'air-fried' fried foods from scratch your options from the enclosed cookbook include potato fries and kale chips (I'm tempted to give the kale chips a try but I question how well these would actually turn out after my fries attempt...).I made fries from raw potatoes using the enclosed instructions and the results were mediocre at best.  After the first round of cooking, which involved a good shake of the basket mid-ways through, the fries were definitely cooked through but floppy, not crisp.  Adding a little extra time just charred the outside edges but still resulted in floppy, soft fries.  They tasted fine but you can get the exact same, if not better, results from a standard oven.  I'm guessing frozen fries would come out better since they really only need to be heated through, not actually cooked.On a final note, this appliance smells... bad.  Perhaps it will dissipate with use but as another reviewer mentioned, it does smell like burning insulation.  I really would not recommend this product to anyone.  Two stars is a generous rating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8ZXZKPYZ8G7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJW2A#wasThisHelpful","R3R8ZXZKPYZ8G7","A25CGBLRJB6X0S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25CGBLRJB6X0S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This game is an excellent puzzle game that can literally keep you playing for a quite some time. I just downloaded it to try it out and he game sucked me in. In a matter of minutes I was so into the game I forgot what I was doing. The objective of the game is to connect all of the shapes together without crossing the lines from other shapes. On occasions you can cross them. The game seems so simple and yet somehow traps you within.PRO's:+ No Ads+ Beautiful design+ No intrusive permissions+ Full Immersive mode (At least on my Nexus 4)+ Lots of puzzles+ Each level difficulty increases graduallyCON's:- Honestly non that I can think of.Conclusion:Even if this game wasn't part of the FAOTD I would've picked it up if I knew about it. The game is beautifully designed and runs silky smooth. This is a keeper in my book. This game is great for all ages. Kid friendly for all the parents out there. I say its at least worth a shot as the FAOTD app. If you read this while it's up them snatch it up while you can. Enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y2G6UM8DTI86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA8WNZ0#wasThisHelpful","R2Y2G6UM8DTI86","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this case as a replacement to my Poetic Borderline Bumper Case that I had on my Nexus 4. I gave it some time to write my review just to see if the things I read about this case were true. Most of these reviews really bring this case down hard. In the time that I've been using it, I've only found that one of the bad things that I read from all those reviews really stand true.I'm a very picky person when it comes to using a case on my phone. I would only put the case on my phone when I really felt like I was going to need it. If I was going to be home I would take off an case that I had on it. I never really found a case that I could just keep on the phone at all times. I had multiple different cases for my Nexus 4 and none lasted more then a day before I would take them off. That is until this case came along.When I bought my Nexus 4 more then a year ago, they were sold out of the official OEM bumper case. It just so happens that every time that I looked for it they were sold out. So I went and tried a good variety of cases for my phone. Until I landed with the poetic. After having for about 7 months it started falling apart on me. It took quite a beating though so I don't blame it. I got it replaced and that one got chewed up by my dog one day when I took it off. I saw this one and at half the price of the OEM I thought I would be getting a good deal. Turns out that I was right.My best friend & share many common interests. We had the same phone. He got his OEM original bumper when he ordered the phone. When I got this one we compared the 2 and found almost no difference. This case is about as it gets to the real thing. If you wan the original bumper without having to pay double the price then you found it here.PRO's:+ Solid Build.+ Excellent Feel.+ Looks Great.+ Blends in with the phone.+ Doesn't take away from the amazing feel of the Nexus 4.CON's:- Headphone jack is a tight fit for some headphones, and others don't fit at all.- The silver lining & buttons do start to show wear after a while.Conclusion:Mine still looks like it just came out of the box. On the corners of the case it does show some very minor signs of wear. Nothing that anyone can notice. That and the headphone jack being a bit small were the only 2 things that I found to be true from other reviewers. Nothing that's really a deal breaker here. In fact I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a new bumper case for their Nexus 4. If you wan the official look & feel of the original, you found what you are looking for. This is an excellent product that I will continue to enjoy until it finally breaks on me. Hope you guys enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQSAYHPU86XC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B199960#wasThisHelpful","R1MQSAYHPU86XC","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: OXA was kind enough to send me a review unit for review purposes. This doesn't affect my review in any way.)For a lot of people out there a keyboard accessory is the perfect accessory for tablet. many people don't like typing on such a big screen. I'm one of those that doesn't like typing on the big screen. When it comes to buying a bluetooth keyboard for your phone or tablet, there are a few things to look at. For me personally, I look for a few this in a keyboard.Things I Keep in Mind:- Look- Feel- Functionality- DurabilityThose are the 4 main things that I look for when I look for a keyboard accessory. Currently I have 2 keyboards for my main tablet. This one that was sent to me by OXA for review purposes and a Poetic leather keyboard case hybrid. They both have their ups and their downs. I personally perfer the OXA aluminum for really just personal reasons that I'll explain. They're both good keyboards, but they have VERY different styles.Look:OXA - An aluminum body that looks and feels very sturdy. Gives it a nice stylish look to it that can make any tablet look like a mini laptop. In the 4 weeks of testing that I've had with it, so many people have confused my tablet for a laptop. Even my friends and family that have seen my tablet many times before were confused by it.Poetic - Since this is a keyboard/case hybrid, it does come with some advantages. When it's closed it looks like a bible with the leather exterior. This sure makes it a lot easier when you leave your backpack, purse, or carrying case at home. Nobody will think of this as a tablet. When it's opened though, the story is completely different. When I had it sitting on a table or desk open, most people confused it for a laptop as well. Although I don't know why. I don't know about you, but I've never seen a leather laptop.Both of these keyboards look great and both get a perfect score here.Feel:OXA - First off I have to say the aluminum is a nice touch. This keyboard is in my opinion ""The Best Out There"". The keys are spaces just right. Not to close that your hands feel cramped, but not so far that you feel like you have to reach for everything. Everything is easy to reach and th keyboard feels like a very premium keyboard. The keys pop out of the aluminum body well. The body is indented where the keys are to level everything out evenly. They have a good amount of push so that you know when you click each key.Poetic - This keyboard is more cramped then the OXA keyboard even though the overall size of the keyboard are exactly the same. I'm not saying it's a bad keyboard to type with, but if you have bigger hands you'll most likely perfer the OXA keyboard. The keys feel great to press as well. The main thing that hold this keyboard back is the leather body. Although it gives it a very premium feel and makes it lighter, I got tired of the leather feel rather quickly.If your main concern is with how the keyboard feels then i think the OXA keyboard is better for you. It just feels better.Functionality:OXA - This one was built with both operating systems in mind. Having dedicated keys that work for both iOS and Android. Beeing able to control music without leaving what you're doing is a huge plus. Although both keyboard do this well, this one just does it better. There is little to no lag from when you press a key to when the tablet reacts.Poetic - Although it has most of the same functions, OXA's keyboard just does them better. I have seen some hickups here and there with this keyboard. Often when you first start typing with this one the first letter or 2 don't seem to register.Durability:OXA - When I look at this keyboard, it looks like it can take some good amount of damage before it will break. When you hold it in your hands it has the feel down packed. But unfortunately, the first one that I recieved came pretty much falling apart. OXA was kind enough to send me a replacement really quickly. Great customer support. The fact that it came falling apart tell me that you don't want to store this is a tight place.Poetic - This is one durable keyboard. They say it's splash proof. I want to call is waterproof. I had an incedent where i spilled water all over it and nothing happened. Lets face it OXA's might be able to survive a fall here and there but I don't think it's waterproof. Plus, this one is flexible.In durability Poetic takes the win.Conclusion:Both of these are exelent keyboard for any tablet that you might have. If you want better performance, go with the the OXA keyboard. If you happen to be a klutz, then you're better off with the Poetic. I have them both and I use them both. I wrote this review using my table with the OXA keyboard and it didn't take me more then a few minutes to write. If you can afford it, get them both. Overall I'd have to give it to the OXA keyboard. It's up to you to decide. The info is there, you decide which one is better for you. Hope you guys found this helpful. Thanks for reading.

"(Note: I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This doesn't affect my review in any way.)Before these I already had a good collection of stylus that I had bought for my phones and tablets. Some were good, but none fit the bill of what I was really looking for. So I started collecting them. Most of them either the tip fell off or fell out of my pocket and got lost somewhere because the clips became extremely lose quickly.These are excellent quality. The clip has remained sturdy, and the you'd are still very fresh. The tips are made of Micro-Knit fiber hybrid. I'm personally a big fan of these types of tips because they slide across your phone or tablet's screen with no resistance at all. This makes for great ease of use.Many other types of tips don't have this ease of flow. It's great for swiping on your keyboard or even for swipe based games. It makes this games easier to play if they only require one handed play. Not to mention that it doesn't leave any marks on your phone's display.I've personally bean using these to play games on my phone and even to navigate my phone. In fact this review was written using theses. Straight from my personal phone and only took a few minutes to write, or swipe I should say.I personal feel like they should've added just a bit more weight to it, but that's just a personal preference. It's made of aluminum so you would think it would weigh more. I feel like if I toss it up in the air when I get bored that it won't come back down. It's definitely a much better build quality then this $1 - $2 cheap stylus.PRO's:+ Excellent build quality.+ Slides across the screen with ease.+ Great for games.+ Leaves absolutely no marks on the screen.CON's:- Could be just a bit heavier.Conclusion:This is a great buy for anyone looking for a good stylus. The ease if use and great build makes it one of the best choices around. Hope you guys like it and I hope I helped you decide. Thanks for reading.

"(Note: This product was given to me in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This doesn't affect my review in any way.)This is the perfect accessory for an iPhone 5/5s. It's no secret that the iPhone 5 and 5s have three major problems. Well this case deals with 2 of those. Number 1 the iPhone's poor battery life. I'm always hearing my friends complaining about how bad battery life is on their iPhone. Number 2 is the new lightning port. If your cable breaks you can't use that old cable you still have from the older models.This case fixes both of those issues. LifeCharge battery case holds a 2300mAh battery that extends the battery life of your iPhone by just over double the battery. The way it handles the other problem is by simply covering the lighting port. Since it is connected via the lighting port you can charge your phone with a normal Micro USB port on the case itself.When you charge the case, if your phone isn't fully charged it will charge the phone first and then the case will start charging. In my experience the case charges really fast. With this case on you don't have to worry about that lighting cable that you broke. You have yourself an easier way to charge your phone now. Since almost everything now a days uses a micro USB.The case has a built-in light indicator to show you how much battery is left in the tank.4 lights = 100 - 75%3 lights = 74 - 50%2 lights = 49 - 25%1 light = 24 - 1%What's in the box:- iPhone 5/5s case- Micro USB charging cable- InstructionsPRO's:+ Slim Case.+ More then doubles battery life.+ Charges fast.+ No more Lightning cable issues.+ Doesn't add much bulk to the phone.+ Has a light indicator on the back to know how much juice it has left.CON's:- Those of you will extremely small hands might not like the added bulk (even though it barely adds anything).Conclusion:If you have an iPhone 5/5s this is a case that I would recommend 9/10 if not 10/10 times. It's an excellent case for anyone. No real CON's here. If you want to get more out of your phone each day this is the way to go.

"(Note: This product was given to me in exchange for it and honest and unbiased review. This is not affect my review in any way.)Theoretically this should be able to fully charge my phone, and still have 500 mAh left. But that's just theoretically. In reality this can really only charge my phone about halfway. This portable charger sports a 2600 mAh battery. My phone sports a 2100 mAh battery. When it comes to a battery heat plays a big role. This portable charger heats up extremely fast. To the point where if you're holding it in your hand it will sweat and it becomes uncomfortable to hold. It's because of this heat that this portable charger to charge my phone past 50%.In reality you could say this portable charger is only about 1100 mAh. My thoughts on the reason why it heats up so quickly is simply the choice of material it's made of. It's made of aluminum and on such a small little product can conduct a ton of heat quickly. I've used this portable charger about 4 times now and its never got my phone past 50%. I usually start charging it when it gets around 5% and this usually runs out of juice at around 49%.Now I wouldn't say this is a bad product, I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking to double their battery life. This is more of an emergency backup power. If you think of it as just an emergency backup power then this might be worth it, but as for me its not. OXA has multiple other products that are much better than this and give you more bang for your buck.PRO's:+ Great Emergency Backup.+ Very small in comparison to others.CON's:- Heats up rather quickly.- Theoretically is 2600mAh, but in reality is only about 1100mAh.- Never charged my phone more then 50%.Conclusion:if you're looking for a small portable charger, there are better options out there. But if you're looking for just an emergency backup then this might be for you. Like I mentioned earlier if you want more bang for your buck, OXA has multiple other portable chargers. Now I'm not saying this is a bad price for this, but its just something I wouldn't buy personally. I couldn't recommend this to anyone honestly unless you're just looking for an emergency backup. I hope I help you guys out deciding whether or not you want to buy this or any other OXA product out there. I have other reviews for other OXA products on my profile if you just click on my name. More reviews are also on the way really soon.

"Honestly if this wasn't a free app of the day, I don't think I would be spending $2 to buy it. Although I do agree that it's a fun app, it's just an Angry Birds Knock-off. It's like an Angry Birds: Explosive Cat Edition.The objective of the game is extremely simple. Rescue a cat while collecting suns. You have a set timer on the explosive cat so you have to collect all the suns and get to the car in need before that time goes out. As you keep going the levels get more and more challenging. There is a currency in the game to get power ups to help you throughout the levels.PRO's:+ Familiar Gameplay+ Somewhat Challenging+ Nice Graphics+ Smooth Gameplay+ Nice Music.CON's:- Music is nice, but it's one of those things that get annoying quickly.- Angry Birds KnockoffWhy buy this at $2 when you could get any of the Angry Birds for free?Conclusion:I don't see myself playing this game much if at all after this review. If it wasn't the FAOTD I wouldn't have waisted $2 to buy it. If you really like Angry Bird style games but aren't into Angry Birds then this is a good alternative. It's the FAOTD so why not give it a shot.

"(Note: This product was given to me in exchange for an honest & unbiased review. This does not effect my review in any way.)When OXA offered me to review this product along with a few others that they have, I thought they had some neat products worth reviewing. As it turns out, I was right. This 8000mAh portable charger is pretty great. Now I have quite a few portable chargers from multiple different companies. You might ask yourself ""why does he need any more portable chargers?"" Well the answer is simple. I don't. Instead of keeping this charger, I decided to give it away to my best friend.The same day it arrived I was headed over to his house so I took it with me. When I got there we wanted to test it out. We found out some things that made us laugh while reading the box. Apparently the person who made the packaging for this product wouldn't be able to spell too save his/her life. What I mean by that is that there are a number of spelling and grammer problems on the box. Now this isn't really important, nor does it take away from this product. I just though it was something to point out.After we finished reading the box and getting a good laugh out of it we took the charger out and tested how well it could charge a couple different things he had in his room. On a single charge it managed to fully charge a PS4 remote, Sony Xperia Play, a Nexus 7, and the last 50% that his Nexus 4 needed to be fully charged. Finally it drained. That's more then what I expected out that little guy. I mean compared to others on the market it's rather small, but it has a good amount of juice. Surprisingly enough, it actually charges pretty fast for an 8000mAh battery.What's in the Box?- 8,000 mAh Portable Charger.- USB-to-Adapter Style Cord.- Multiple different adapter tips. (Micro USB, Mini USB, exc..)PRO's:+ It's strong enough to charge your phone or tablet a few times.+ Very compact size.+ Nice and Sturdy design.This isn't a bulky charger that's going to draw attention.CON's:- The box has some grammer mistakes.Conclusion:Honestly the only con there was just me nit picking. It doesn't take away from this charger in any way. If you need a good portable charger this one a great one to go with. If you have some time, and you don't need one right away I suggest checking out some of OXA's other portable chargers as I will be reviewing a few others that they have. You could compare them based on my review and others that have reviewed them as well.

"Note: I was given this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my review.)At first glance this looks great, but after testing it I feel like it's a bit of a biased accessory. My initial rating was only 3 stars, and I'll tell you why in just a second. The main reason that I have it 4 stars is because my mom really enjoyed it.Now let's get on with the review. The reason my initial impressions of this was 3 stars is because I feel it's kinda biased. I feel like this us geared more towards Apple's iPhone. The pocket is really small. I put my phone in the pocket and I could barely close it.Now I don't know about you but I like to listen to music when I go in a jog. I also want to make sure my phone isn't going to fly out of my pocket. When I was offered to review this my first thought was ""that's just what I needed."" Unfortunately I want able to fit my phone in the pocket and close it with headphones attached. When I tried to close it, it was so tight that the zipper actually press the power button and turned off my phone. Sure I could've just left it open, but what's the good in that? For that I could've just left it in my pocket.Another reason I felt it was a bit biased. The second pocket is to store your keys. But with my phone in the first pocket, it was so tight that my keys wouldn't fit in the second one. When I tried this with an iPhone, it was a while different story. The phone and keys fit perfectly, but I'm not an iPhone user.It's not like a have a huge phone. I have a Nexus 4 as my daily driver. In the description it says that the Galaxy S4 would fit. I don't see that happening when a Nexus 4 is smaller. Now let's get on to some PRO's & CON's.PRO's:+ Holds an ""iPhone"" and your keys great.+ It's very durable from my testing.+ Fits around almost anyone's waist with an adjustable strap.CON's:- Rather small pockets- Feels biased (Geared towards Apple's iPhones)Conclusion: If you have an iPhone, or a small android (like one of the mini's), then this is finally something youwant if you go out got joss and need a place to store your phone and keys. If you're someone that I'd more into the bigger Android phones (4.7 inch display or higher), then you might want to look somewhere else unless you don't mind leaving the pocket open.

"(Note: I was given this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my review.)This review is more of a comparison with the Bracoo Leg Sleeves. Initial impressions of these. They're just a bit bigger then the Bracoo Leg Sleeves length wise. Both of them are extremely comfortable and can be worn for long periods of time without your legs going numb. After a while you actually forget that you have then on.The differences between these 2 leg sleeves are really just how they feel when you have then on. They both get the job done remarkably. These have more of a thermal feel, while the Bracoo sleeves feel more like under armor. Both of them feel great. I don't think you could go wrong with either one. I have both and love them both.Here's the description from my other review that really just fit both extremely well.""Whether you decide to use them for besketball, football, soccer, the morning jog that you take every morning, or all of the above. They'll do there job as expected. They're comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time without the pain or numbness from cutting off blood circulation. The sleeves allow air through them to keep your leg from getting too hot and getting a cramp. The compression keeps your muscles from getting too loose and causing them to wear out early.""PRO's:+ Comfortable to wear for long periods of time.+ Reduces leg muscle fatigue by compressing the muscle and not letting them get too loose.+ Allows air to go through so that your legs don't get too hot or cramp up.+ Increases leg muscle performance by not allowing your legs to wear out easily.CON's:- Nothing to say here.Conclusion:If you're a person that plays any type of sports, or goes for that morning jog then this is deffinately for you. The price is great for what you're getting. I deffinately recommend this to anyone that does exercize in general.

"(Note: I was given this product in exchange for an honest/unbiased review. This does not affect my review in any way.)(Another Note: This is a support meant for activities. For those of you looking for more of a more solid support that doesn't allow you to move your ankle, this isn't the one for you.)I'm a very cautious person when it comes to my ankles. Since I play sports all the time I know the pain of many injuries. One of the most painful of them is an ankle injury. I've had injuries from broken wrist, torn muscles, dislocated shoulders, ankle sprains, knee injuries and more. Trust and believe that I know what I'm talking about when I tell you I know what an injury feels like.Comfytopia asked me to review a new product called Bracoo Leg Sleeves. After reviewing them, they gave me the option to review another product of my choosing. I asked if they had any ankle or knee supports. They sent me a knee strap (which you can find the review for it, and the leg sleeves on my profile page) and this ankle support.Immediately after trying this support on you can feel a huge difference. It's very comfortable, and has a strong/firm grip. When I go play basketball I usually wear ankle sleeves, leg sleeves, and knee strap (Like I said before, I'm very cautious.). After twisting my ankle again yesterday while playing basketball, I decided to put on the ankle support on top of the sleeves. The the support isn't too tight that you can't move it, but one thing is for sure. I won't be twisting it anytime soon. I did a little test to try to twist it to see how much it could withstand and it was hard to get very far. Extremely firm yet still lets you run comfortably. I haven't had any problems with long term use.PRO's:+ Firm Grip.+ Breathable material retains heat and prevents skin irritation.+ Comfortable for long term use.+ Adjustable to fit most and both feet.+ Open heel allows you to move easily when playing sports or any other kind of activity.+ Cross straps allow easy adjusting to firmly hold and evenly support weak, sore, or injured ankles.+ Great PriceCON's:- Nothing to say here.Conclusion:This is just the type of support that I need for all the sports that I play. 5 Star rating is firm. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good ankle support while doing any type of activity. Take it from a person who lives an active lifestyle. I hope you guys enjoy and thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWV5U6UPKAFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BIRDB0#wasThisHelpful","RGWV5U6UPKAFF","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: I was given this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not effect my review in any way.)IImmediately after you start to read this book you can tell the book has some surprises just from the way it starts. After about 3 chapters into the book, the main character Dana started to seem like a very familiar character. As of I had met her before. As I kept reading I started to realize that she had somewhat of a close resemblance to another character I know from a show. The fact that she resembled this character made me want to keep reading this book. The more I read, the more interesting the book became.This book has a few crazy twists that really just make you want to keep reading it to see what's going to happen. Now I'm not much of a reader (Per Say). For some reason I just couldn't help but to keep reading. The plot of this book is surprisingly detailed for such a short book. I'm a big fan of a good twist. Something that makes you think one thing and then takes a completely different turn. This one wasn't as big as you would expect or maybe it was just because I saw it coming. But none the less a good one. If you just visualize it all in your head this book will blow your mind.Meet The Main Characters:+ Dana = The Main Character+ Zoe = Dana's Sister+ Tyler = Dana's boyfriend+ The rest are mostly support characters.As the book goes on you start to asking yourself a few questions.- Is Tyler real?...- Is Dana going insane?...- Did she make all of this up?...- What is really going on here?...The twists that happen here are some that I know you will enjoy. If I wouldn't have received this book for free to review it. I would've most definitely bought it for sure. No doubt in my mind if you enjoy a good thriller, you will enjoy this one. I would recommend this book to anyone that love a good short read, wants to pass the time, or just wants a few exciting twists.(Finally Note: Writing a review about a book without giving away any spoilers can be pretty hard. Especially from a good book like this one.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9PFWW48RIMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEF014E#wasThisHelpful","R1I9PFWW48RIMJ","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: I was giving this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not effect my review in any way.)I play sports all the time and as of lately have been more on the recovery side. A knee injury that happened a little over 2 months ago. After that injury I wasn't able to play any sports for quite some time. About 2 weeks ago I started getting back out there because I needed to start putting some pressure back on my knee again. First couple days didn't go so well. Then, Comfytopia offered my a chance to review some of there products that just so happen to help heal, and prevent further injury. Ankle Support, Knee Strap, & Leg Sleeves which you can find my review for it on my profile (by clicking on my name). After trying out the legs sleeves and knee strap it was like I never stopped playing. I came back strong.The leg sleeves allowed me to ay without tiring out my legs out, or getting cramps. The knee strap allowed me to play as if I wasn't injured. Although it can't completely take away the pain, it still allowed me to run which I can't do without it. The strap has a tubular insert that provides focused mild pressure on the tendon just below the kneecap to help guide the kneecap. It can be adjusted to fit most.PRO's:+ Tubular insert with focused pressure to help guide the patella.+ Fully adjustable strap.+ Comfortable for all day use.+ Protects & prevents knee injuries while any type of activity.+ One size fits most.+ Prevents an already injured knee from getting worse.CON's:- Doesn't take all the pain away from a already injured knee away.Conclusion:This is something that I use everyday since I got it and I really don't leave the house without it on. Weather it's to play sports, take a walk, ride a bike, or just to go out. I recommend this for anyone that is worried about injuring their knee while playing any type of sport, or if you already have an injury and need some support for your knee. This is a great product for anyone. It's inexpensive and feels great. Hope you guys enjoy and thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37INFLB9F391W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LA8ZDY#wasThisHelpful","R37INFLB9F391W","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: I recieved this portable speaker for free in exchange for an honest review.This does not effect my review in any way.)When I first saw the speaker, I would've never believed anyone who told me how loud it really is. When I was testing it out I was in my kitchen cooking and the room was just lit up with blasting music as if it was by a regular house stereo system. The bass from this little monster is nothing short of excellent. From the moment my mom heard how loud this monster was she wanted to take it from me. She's went out and bought quite a few portable mini speakers for around the same price and I can honestly say they're no match for this one.Tech Specs:Dimentions: (L)115MM x(W)62MM x(H)56.2MMWeight: 8oz (Half a pound)Speaker: (2) 40MMImput: L/R 400MVPower Output: 4W* 2AMP Freq Range: 200Hz-16KHzBattery: 800mAhCharging time: 2HrsPlaying Time: 3-4Hrs (4Hrs from my personal use)Bluetooth: 4.0Bluetooth Distance: 30ftWhat's Included:+ BSPR300 Speaker+ USB Charging Cable+ User Manuel+ 3.5MM to 3.5MM cable+ Travel PouchPRO's:+ Compact Size+ Incredibe Bass+ Huge Sound+ Great Price+ Light Weight+ Easy To Use (Note: When you turn it on, it's already on pairing mode every time)+ Touch Controls+ Charges Fast+ Decent Battery Life+ Easily Portable+ Bluetooth 4.0+ Built-in Mic for Phone Calls+ 1 Year WarrantyCON's: (Hard to find some, but here they are)- Bass can sometime take over a song completely to the point that you can barely hear the words.- At it's highest volumes if the music you have isn't the best quality, it will show.- Sound quality for phone calls weren't the best. (You can't expect much consdering most speakers at this price don't even bring a Built-in Mic.)Conclusion:At this price, it definately competes well. My sister and my mom both buy defferent mini speakers all the time in search of one that really blows the rest away. I think it's safe to say that they won't be searching for one for a while after they heard this one. I have to give this portable speaker 5 stars for all that it brings to the table for such a small price. My sister, mom, brother, & stepfather all want one after just a glimps of it. It can't get much better then that at this price point.

"Note: I was given this product for free in exchange for an honest review. In no way does this effect my review.Let me start off by saying I haven't played sports in 2 months thanks to a knee injury while playing basketball. After 2 months of no sports, you can expect to get fatigued in a hurry. Just a few days prior to recieving these leg sleeves I tried to go warm up with just a shootaround and it was a disaster. After just 15 minutes my legs couldn't take much more. After having tried these out today at the basketball court, I was on the top of my game. My shot needed some work, but my legs didn't get tired. I was there for about 4 hours, and played about 8 games with my friends. After all that, I felt like I only used a fraction of the energy in my legs.These leg sleeves are a real piece of work. When you get tired, you start to slow down, your defence isn't as precise as it was at the beginning of the game, you start to get sloppy, you can't jump as high, or take a decent shot for that matter. If you're using these leg sleeves it's a whole different story. You don't loose your speed, agility, defensive ability, or hops. They allow you to stay on the top of your game.Whether you decide to use them for besketball, football, soccer, the morning jog that you take every morning, or all of the above. They'll do there job as expected. Thay're comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time without the pain or numbness from cutting off blood circulation. The sleeves allow air through them to keep your leg from getting too hot and getting a cramp. The compression keeps your muscles from getting too loose and causing them to wear out early. Lets do a quick recap of PRO's and CON's.PRO's:+ Comfortable to wear for long periods of time.+ Reduces leg muscle fatigue by compressing the muscle and not letting them get too loose.+ Allows air to go through so that your legs don't get too hot or cramp up.+ Increases leg muscle performance by not allowing your legs to wear out easily.CON's:- I kinda wish the came with more accent colors.Conclusion:If you're a person that plays any type of sports, or goes for that morning jog then this is deffinately for you. Even schools could use these to help improve there players stamina. The price is great for what you're getting. I deffinately recommend this to anyone that does exercize in general.

"I had Aspahlt 7: Heat since it was released, and let me just say ""amazing"". Asphalt 8: Airborne is over the top. With much improved graphics over the 7th one. This game is by far the best car racing game on the market to date.+ Graphics: (5/5) = The graphics from this game are amazing. Starting to get up to par with consoles.+ Gameplay: (5/5) = The controls and gameplay are easy to get used to. Easy to handle and very smooth.+ Performance: (3/5) = The game runs extreemly smooth for a while. If you play it for more then an hour the performance starts to lag. It got to the point where it froze my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and I had to completely restart it.+ Sound Effects: (5/5) = The games sound effects are on point.PRO's:+ Gameplay is great.+ Graphics are phenomenal.+ Sound effects are good.+ Multiplayer is nice.+ Includes Amazon GameCircle.+ Lots of cars to choose from.+ Good selection of maps.CON's:- Performance has some lag issues.Conclusion:The game is only $0.99 and is well worth that price. If you want the best car racer on the market, then stop looking. You found it. This is the best there is. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of that performance bug. Other then that the game is perfect. I'm sure that will be fixed in a future update really soon, but until then 4 stars is what it gets. Hope you guy/girls enjoy ths game and thanks for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KPY1LCGVYWD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQ0CKRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KPY1LCGVYWD4","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: This review is for those using the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I don't yet know how it works with the other versions of the Kindle.Just when I was about to buy the first one. The second one wasn't available for for Kindle Fire HD yet, they add it to the Amazon Appstore. How lucky am I? Getting it on the first day, and being the first to review it. So far the game is almost perfect. A few minor issues here and there, but nothing major. Right of the bat the game force closed (FC) on me when I opened it. I thought it wouldn't work. I gave it another shot and would you look at that, it worked. (The FC must have been something unrelated to the game.) The game has a very short, but informative tutorial right when you start. I have yet to get far in the game so I will update this review if needed. Here are some PRO's & CON's.PRO's:+ 3D Graphics are great.+ Tutorial is Short, Sweet, and To the point.+ Gameplay is smooth as silk.+ Has a nice Multiplayer.+ Uses Amazon GameCircle. (More games should use this.)+ Good variety of customization.CON's:- Unresponsive on occasions (If you touch the screen while it's on a loading screen).Conclusion:The game is nearly perfect. It's well worth the $2.99 price tag. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the game became unresponsive when I accidentally touched the screen while it was loading more then once (won't force close but it comes up with a message saying that it is not responding and asks if you want to wait or force close it). If you just click wait it will continue without any problems. That's just a minor bug that I'm sure will be fixed in a future update. The game is pretty new so you can expect a glitch/bug here and there. If you guys are looking to buy it, my suggestion is go for it. Thumbs up on the buy. You won't be disappointed. Hope this helps and thanks for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RCL2SPAMSV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEL0LGY#wasThisHelpful","R38RCL2SPAMSV6","A1EGBVG3N14H8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EGBVG3N14H8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally bought this app for my mom, not for myself. I saw this app about a week ago and I know that my mom loves Zumba workouts. Ironically enough I bought this app/game for her on my birthday (That's a turn around) two days ago. When I asked her to give it a shot she told me to try it out first. I didn't really want to. Although I do dance, Zumba dances aren't really my style. As you can expect I failed miserably for the first half of the dance. It took my about half way though the song to be able to pick some of the dance moves. It was actually really fun after I tried it the first time. It felt like playing Just Dance 4 on PS3 or Xbox 360. Lets jump into some PRO's and CON's.Pro's:+ Camera detects movements really well.+ Highly addictive.+ Has a learn the moves section.+ 6 different songs. (Up to 43 Add-on songs)+ Great workout.+ Measures calories burned (based on movement).+ Keeps track of your workout (Daily, Weekly, & Monthly).Con's:- You have to buy the rest of the songs serparately. (4 different add-on packs)* 3 packs - $9.99 each or* Full Package - $24.99 (Brings all 43 add-ons)Conclusion:The big question here is simple. Is this worth $4.99 price tag with only 6 song? The answer is ""Yes"". Even without the other songs this app is well worth the price. You're getting a good workout along with a ton of fun. You can have up to 6 profile for different members of the family and even have a friendly competition to see who can get the best high score. This app will amaze you even more if you can connect your phone/tablet to your flat screen TV. I did this with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had so much fun competing against my mom. If you really look at it, even buying the full package at $24.99 is better then buying the DVD set. The set will rack up to $120 sometimes more sometimes less. In reality this is much more portable. Why would you take a set of DVD's with you, when you could just take your phone/tablet and have it there with you at all times.

After giving this a try I felt so relaxed, and my muscles were free of pain and soreness.After trying this product just one time you'll feel a real difference. It soothens your sore muscles and makes you feel like you just came out of a spa. This product will have you wanting more.

"The objective of this app is to complete a puzzle like Sudoku using numbers as hints to fill in the tiles. Once you fill them correctly you reveal a picture behind it and you win. This app is surprisingly more challenging then you thing from first glance. I love a challenging game and this game is nothing short of challenging. I thought I was going to end up getting gold on all the puzzles and I ended up with silver on quite a few the first time around. Although the game is fun and challenging, I could only rate it 3 stars. Check out some PRO's & CON's.PRO's:+ Slide to complete controls.+ Double tap to fill in the squares (allows for fewer mistakes).+ Simple UI.+ Surprisingly challenging.+ Stupidly addicting (at least for me it was hard to stop for a second to write a review).Con's:- Pressing back (on Kindle Fire) after a win resets your game.- Although screen real estate might be good on a phone they didn't take full advantage of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9's large screen.Conclusion:I got this game as the FAOTD, but I would have surely paid for it if I wouldn't have. It's worth the price so if you don't manage to get it while it's free it's still worth the buy for those who love Sudoku, or even just a good challenging every once in awhile when you're bored.

I have long thick hair and had problem with brushes pulling and yanking my hair, but don't get that with this brush. Another thing that's great about it is that removing the hair from the brush takes no effort. This brush is great for both men and women as well as all sorts of hair types.

"The BestFire essential oil diffuser is probably one of the best diffusers I have owned yet. I have a huge collection of essential oils that I am obsessed with. I think essential oils are a healthier alternative to freshen up your home. I use to buy aerosol air fresheners, but after a while it become expensive and also not so good for your health.The BestFire essential diffuser can work as both a oil diffuser or you can just use it as a humidifier. I just add a few drops of oil and it immediately freshens my whole room up. This does hold a great amount of water in the tank, and has an auto shut off timer that allows it to turn itself off once the water is gone. This is perfect because sometimes we all get busy and can forget to turn something off. My favorite thing about this diffuser is that when it's on it doesn't shoot water all over the place like other diffusers that I have owned. This diffuser does need to be plugged into an outlet in order for it to be used, keep that in mind. It the buttons for the lights and mist on the front of the diffuser. I personally think this diffuser would work for any room in any house even an office. This is great for someone who has just started using essential oils or someone who has been using them for years.Overall, I am very pleased and happy with my new BestFire essential oil and would definitely recommend it.

" 1:05 MinsDragonflies have a very special significance to me. When I saw these Dragon string lights, I had to have them. They are far more darling in person than the actual picture shows.These do take 3-AA batteries that aren't included. These would go great outdoors or indoors. Since I live in an apartment, I decided that I would keep them indoors. The lights on the dragonfly string is warm which I love. It gives any room that cozy homey feeling. There is 16 dragonflies on the strand of lights, and the lights have eight different settings. When I turned it on each light bulb worked great. There is only one button that works as turning it off/on and to pick the light setting. I do wish that it did have a separate on/off button so that it could make turning off/on easier instead of having to click thru several times. The dragonflies are made of a hard plastic, but with proper care they should last for years to come.Overall, I think am very pleased and love these lights and would definitely recommend them. I think these would make a great gift or just add a beautiful touch to any home.

"I love making vlogging videos, but hate carrying a traditional selfie stick around and a huge bulky tripod. I needed something light weight and something that was simple to put up. I decided to get this Accmor selfie stick/tripod because it's a two in one. As a selfie stick its very simple to use and can extend to your liking. It works well with my iPhone 6. As a tripod, it works just as great as my larger tripod. I love that I can use it vertical or horizontal. Most selfie stick/tripods only allow for my phone to be in horizontal mode. Overall, I am very pleased with this self stick and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great selfie stick/tripod. I think this is a great gadget for vloggers.

"I have been having back pains the last couple of weeks and needed something to help give me support while I sit at my desk. This Go Active Lifestyle Lumar back cushion has made a difference in the way my back feels while sitting for long periods of time at my desk. The foam on the inside conforms to the shape of my back. I don't have to worry over time that this will go flat. It's adjustable so can most chairs. It does come with a additional extension strap for larger chairs. The mesh is removable so I can wash it. I have washed the mesh and it has held up in the washer. I would recommend putting the mesh in a delicate bag and hang drying it. Overall, I am pleased with this lumbar cushion. It has helped sitting in a chair for a long period of time bearable. I would recommend it.

"I am a huge bamboo cutting board fan so I decided to get these Heim Concept cutting boards. I love that these cutting boards are thicker than most other cutting boards that I have had in the past. They do not contain any nasty chemicals that can harm your family.I frequently used plenty of plastic cutting boards, which turned out to be a waste of money. With plastic cutting boards you have to worry about bacteria harboring in them. They just get disgusting after a few uses and washes. These cutting boards come in three different sizes  Small is 6 by 8 Inch, Medium is 8-1/2 by 11 Inch and Large is 9-1/2 by 13 Inch. These different sized cutting boards are really convenient because sometimes you dont need to dirty up a large cutting board to cut up small foods. I have been using them daily and haven't noticed any cutting marks in them from my knives. These are very easy to wash and care for. I would not recommend putting these in the dishwasher since they could warp and ruin them.Overall, these Heim Concept bamboo cutting boards are nice and meet my expectations. I would recommend them if you are looking for a new set of cutting boards.

" 0:24 Mins I have owned so many headphones in my life and hated about half of them. I have very sensitive ears and have a hard time finding ones that are comfortable over my ears. I am not a huge fan of headphones that you have to put inside of your ear. I have trouble finding the right fit for me, so I prefer over the ears headphones.These Ailihen headphones are very nice. They are comfortable over the ears and don't leave my ears feeling sore after a while of wearing them. I am very impressed with the quality of the headphones. I personally think these are perfect for both adults as well as children. They are adjustable and also foldable which is great when it comes to storage. This works great on any mp3 player, phone, etc. The only feature I haven't used on these headphones is the microphone. The sound that comes from the headphones is crystal clear. There is no breaking up or distortion. These headphones come in five fun uni-sex friendly colors. These are also the perfect for both children and adults.Overall, I am very pleased with these headphones and would definitely recommend them to anyone and everyone that is looking for a new pair of headphones.

"I normally wear a size 32D, so I went ahead and got a size up (XL) from the recommended size (L). I can honestly say that this bra just wasn't for me. It made my breast look and feel like they were sagging. There isn't much support going on and the cup that's in the inside of the bra is on the smaller side. I think this bra is more suitable for a woman with a smaller chest size.I washed it and passed it down to my sister who has a smaller chest size. So far she thinks it's ok and just uses it when she is wearing a tube top and doesn't want her bra straps to be showing. When I washed it I put it in a delicate bag. It held up well, but I did have to flip the cup because it went the opposite way.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this bra to anyone who has a larger chest size as this wasn't made for us.

" 1:05 MinsDragonflies have a very special significance to me. When I saw these Dragon string lights, I had to have them. They are far more darling in person than the actual picture shows.These do take 3-AA batteries that aren't included. These would go great outdoors or indoors. Since I live in an apartment, I decided that I would keep them indoors. The lights on the dragonfly string is warm which I love. It gives any room that cozy homey feeling. There is 16 dragonflies on the strand of lights, and the lights have eight different settings. When I turned it on each light bulb worked great. There is only one button that works as turning it off/on and to pick the light setting. I do wish that it did have a separate on/off button so that it could make turning off/on easier instead of having to click thru several times. The dragonflies are made of a hard plastic, but with proper care they should last for years to come.Overall, I think am very pleased and love these lights and would definitely recommend them. I think these would make a great gift or just add a beautiful touch to any home.

"My sister in law and brother recently had my baby niece. They had been working on a owl themed room since the day they found out they were expecting a girl. When I saw these owl wall decals from Navy Penguin, I had to get it for them. They come neatly and safely rolled in a tube to prevent them from being ruined before you get a chance to put them up. The wall decals were easy to take off the paper and easy to put up on the wall. I am very pleased with the size and looks great around her bookshelf area. What my brother and sister in law loved about them is that they are removable in case they decide to put it elsewhere or when she grows and they need to update her room. These wall decals also don't ruin your walls by removing paint or leaving any sticky residue. Overall, I would definitely recommend this wall decal to anyone looking to decorate a nursery or a little girls room.

"After getting my daughters each an MP3 player, I decided I would go ahead and get my nephew one since he is the same age as one of my daughters. I figured that this Tomameri was a appropriate MP3 player for a younger child. This Tomameri Mp3 player is a perfect first Mp3 player. The features are very basic and simple. You don't have to be very computer/electronic suave to understand how to use this.This is the perfect mp3 player for people of all ages. It comes with a charging USB cord, headphones and a 16 GB Micro SD card. It doesn't get any better than that for something at this price. You do have to upload music your own music from a computer, but it's very simple to do. It also supports Ebooks, videos, games and does have a built in voice recorder. I am not really sure why kids love to record themselves talking, but all mine do. The buttons and controlling what does what was a little confusing at first. We did figure out how to maneuver around. They do come in several colors to choose from, I got my nephew the red one. I love that I don't have to worry about her getting on the internet like he would have been able to had we gotten him an actual iPod. I don't have to worry about parental controls, because I control what goes into the mp3 player.Overall, this isn't a fancy iPod or high priced MP3 player, but is a great beginners mp3 player. It think it's perfect for any kid, teen or even adult. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're looking to get something like this for a younger child.

"Previously to using this deep hair mask and conditioner, my hair was very dry because of all the dying and heat damage I have done to my hair. I find that if I don't add some form of moisture daily to my hair it feels and looks gross. I was super excited when I got the opportunity to try out this Arvazallia Hair mask and instantly fell in love. I have used several of their products and this one is a favorite of mine. I just used it after shampooing my hair. I let it sit in for 5-7 minutes like the container says and washed it out. This hair mask smells really good. I did instantly noticed a difference in my hair texture after it dried. It left my hair feeling and looking hydrated and revived. I have been using it for two weeks and my hair looks and feels fabulous. If I had to complain on something, the jar is a bit on the small size.

I have been using it for the last few weeks and noticed a huge change in the look of my hair. Not only does my hair look healthy, but feels healthy. After using this conditioner in my hair, it left it feeling so soft, smooth and hydrated. It didn't leave my hair feeling oily or left a built up feeling like most conditioners do. It is really hard to describe the texture of the conditioner because it doesn't feel like your usual conditioner. It feels really nice and is easy to wash off. A little does go a long way. This is far better than your average store bought conditioner, and safe to use on a daily basis. I also loved that my hair wasn't tangled and was easy to brush out.

"This picture doesn't do justice as to how adorable the Oak Leaf vanity mirror is. I needed a vanity mirror for my dresser so that when I get ready in my room I can see my face while applying my makeup. I use to have a large door sized mirror, but with a baby I didn't think it was safe to have out anymore and decided I needed something smaller and that would be out of the way. It fits with just about any room decor. It does have a chrome finish. Upon inspection, I didn't notice any kind of flaking or cracking on the finish. If you decide to keep it in the bathroom you don't have to worry about the moisture ruining it. It does have a 5x magnifying side which is great when you're plucking out your eyebrows, putting eyeliner or fake eyelashes. It does have some weight at the base so that it doesn't tip and fall over while sitting on a flat surface. When it first came it wasn't assembled. There was no instructions on how to put it together, but it literally took less than two minutes to assemble it.

"I have quite a few portable bank chargers and charging cables, but sometimes I forget my charging cables to connect my phone to my power bank to charge. This iWALK is both charging dock and cable in one. No more walking out the house without a charging cable. What I love about this charging dock is the size. It's small enough to fit in your pocket, purse, or backpack. It comes with a charging USB cord to charge the actual doc, but once it's fully charged you can take it with you. I haven't been out longer than eight hours at a time so I can't say for certainty how long the power bank lasts once you take it off charge, but it did last me eight hours with battery life to spare.This already has a USB connector part, but will only charge android devices. I have a iPhone 6 and you're probably wondering what's the point of mentioning that if I can't charge it on the dock. I am here to tell you, you're wrong. You can purchase iPhone 6 pins for really cheap that connect to the dock USB adapter part (not familiar with phone terminology). It will charge your phone the same way.

"My husband and I are huge beer drinkers. Now we don't drink often, but we occasionally like a beer after a long day, a meal or while hanging out with family and/or friends. My husband had been talking about making his own at home beer for while now, so I thought this DIY beer brewing book would be a great read for him. When it came in he was pretty excited about it.Now this isn't your typical cookbook and doesn't just give you a recipe. This book actually gives you 101 in making your own beer. Like the book says, ""You don't have to have a degree in brewing science to make good beer""(9). This DIY gives you ten basic and easy steps to brewing beer. There is also a 23 step by step illustration process for first-time homebrewers for people like my husband. He actually needs some kind of illustration instructions to go by because he likes to be sure that he is doing it right. What my husband loved about this book is that there is history and lists the different styles of beer. Who would have known there was so many categories of Lager and Ale beers. This book gives you the list of equipment you need to start home brewing your own beer and the different types of ingredients that you need to make each beer recipe taste great.My only complaint would be that we would have liked to see pictures of finished beers just to get an idea of how dark or light the beers should be. Illustration helps to give the reader an idea of what a food or drink is suppose to look like once the recipe is completed. Overall, my husband really enjoyed reading this book and already bookmarked a few beer recipes that he plans on making.

"I love cooking and always willing to try something new. I am a huge Korean food lover and was excited to try some of the yummy recipes from this Seoul Food Korean cookbook. There is 135 different recipes to try. What I love about this cookbook is that whether you're a huge meat, drink, desert, veggie or noodle lover, there is a little something for everyone.The first chapter gives a little background on Korean food as well as some table manners which I loved reading about, because I am always interested in other cultures. Chapter two is broken into two parts. It just give you the essential cookware, tableware, spices and ingredients that are commonly used when it comes to Korean cuisine. I am a huge rice lover so I was super excited when I saw the tips and tricks to making the perfect rice. Let me tell you, when I did exactly as the recipe recommended my rice came out perfect. Each recipe has a little introduction about the meal, also has the list of ingredients, step by step instructions, prep time, cook time and also a level of pepper on the side which I am assuming is to let you know how much heat is in the actual dish. Of course, you can always adjust the recipes to the level of heat you like in your food. Some of the recipes also have a variation tip at the bottom which is great to see other ways that the meal can be eaten or served. Now that we are in the fall season I was very excited to see the recipe for pumpkin porridge because my husband and I love pumpkin anything.Now, If I had to complain about anything it would be that there is a lack of photos. There is a photo at the beginning of every chapter, but I would have loved to seen a photo of the actual finished recipe. This as a reader helps to see what the recipe is suppose to look like when it is done. I always like to compare my food with the finished food to a recipe I am following. This helps me to get an idea of what I am missing. Overall, I am very pleased with my new cookbook and very happy to add it to my collection of cookbooks.

"I don't know how many times I have finished something in my kitchen with a cute jar and can't figure out what to do with it. Normally I just recycle them, but lately have been seeing so many cute DYI pins on Pinterest. I figured I would go ahead and add my own lotions and hand soaps in them, but didn't have any kind of pumps that fit my jars.These Smith's soap dispenser lids are perfect to turn plain mason jars into something else. They fit on just about any normal/standard sized mason jar with ease. They are stainless steel so they won't rust or get ruined. The pump works great and doesn't get stuck. I also like that the tube reaches almost to the bottom of my jar which will allow me to get the most of my soaps. I have had a problem with other soap dispensers that have short tubes, because half way thru I would have to twist the lid off to get soap out. Another thing I love about them is that they are very nice and sleek looking. They fit in with any room decor.

"I love this four piece mixing bowl set from Checkered Chef. I love to bake cakes and cupcakes but didn't have any solid mixing bowls. This is the perfect sized bowls for mixing or prepping all types of food. It's also great to use for marinating chicken or steaks.They are very easy to clean and I love that I have the option of hand washing it or throwing them in the dishwasher. I was sort of skeptical about putting them in the dishwasher because I didn't want to ruin it, but they held up well. It's stainless steel so I don't have to worry about them rusting with proper care. Aside from marinating and using for baking these can also be used for salads, serving bowls, etc. the possibilities are endless.

"Anytime that I can get my hands on a bamboo pillow, I don't pass up the opportunity. If you've never tried a bamboo pillow before, you have to. I had an old bamboo memory pillow that my daughter decided she needed to have. So, I decided I would go ahead and get a new one. I have been using this pillow for a little over a month, which is enough time to try out the pillow and enough time for any flaws to be noticed.When I received this pillow it was extremely flat like most bamboo pillows. Once you unroll it, it starts to fill itself out. I let my bamboo pillow set for a full day and my pillow expanded to the size it's suppose to be. There was a slight odor, but it disappeared after a few days of airing it out. I think if I had to complain about anything it would be the smell. This is the first pillow I had that took a few days to air out versus a few hours. I do love how soft yet firm this pillow is. It conforms and provides great support to my head and neck. I haven't had to wake up in the middle of the night to readjust or fluff up my pillow. It is still nice and full like the first day I received and opened it up.Overall, I would definitely give this pillow four stars (because of the smell).

I am not really sure why kids love to record themselves talking, but all mine do. The buttons and controlling what does what was a little confusing at first. We did figure out how to maneuver around. They do come in several colors to choose from. I got the pink mp3 player for my daughter and so far she loves it. I love that I don't have to worry about her getting on the internet like she would have been able to had we gotten her a actual iPod. I don't have to worry about parental controls, because I control what goes into the mp3 player.Overall, this isn't a fancy iPod or high priced MP3 player, but is a great beginners mp3 player. It think it's perfect for any kid, teen or even adult. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're looking to get something like this for a younger child. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JFXEOQWQZNO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z9V0LQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JFXEOQWQZNO8","A27EISXEPOPG5E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27EISXEPOPG5E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These set of two kneeling pads are heaven sent. I don't know how many times I have cleaned my bathtub or taken my kids a bath, and wished that I had something to keep my knees comfortable.Each kneeling pad is very comfortable and has great cushion. It has more cushion than I was originally thinking it would have. This is perfect for all kinds of uses: bath time, cleaning, gardening, exercising, or just even to sit on while on the floor. The handle on the side of easy cushion makes for easy carrying around and also storage. This is one of those products that I wish I had a long time ago. I love that this is a two pack because I have 2 bathrooms and can have one stored in each bathroom. I don't have to go back and forth with them.Overall, I am very pleased and looking forward to having these kneeling pads last me for years to come.

"I have a 42'' Panasonic TV in my room. I love my TV, but with limited space I needed a better to put my TV. We had a TV stand, but that took too much room. I have owned several Ohuhu products that love, so I knew that this TV mount was going to be another product that I loved.My only complaint would be that this didn't come with instructions so figuring out how to get it set up was a pain in the butt. It took us a good hour trying to figure out where the screws went. Once we got it up on the wall, we loved it. I love how sturdy and secure the wall mount is. I do love that I can adjust my TV so that I can see it from where I am sitting. If your HDMI plugins are on the back it's gonna be hard to get easy access to them because of how close to the wall it is once installed.Overall, I am very pleased with this TV wall mount and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a more space friendly way to store their TV.

"I have recently gotten into collecting essential oils over the last few months. I have a few aromatherapy diffusers in my home that are in just about every room in my home.There are so many uses for essential oils: cleaning, health and even natural aromatherapy. There was a point in time where I use to buy aerosol cans to freshen up my home. Aerosol cans are expensive and health wise just aren't a good choice. If you're just getting into essential oils this is such a great set to have. I love that it doesn't have the basic essential oils that other kits have had. This set comes with: Breathe Again, Dreamy Sleep, Health Guard, Mellow Mind, Romantic Paradise and Tropical Island. These are all new scents to me and I love each and everyone of them. If I had to complain, my only complaint is that I wish the bottles were larger because I love them that much. This set of essential oils came beautifully packaged in a hard box and would make such a great gift.Overall, I am very pleased with this set and would recommend it to any essential lover out there.

"I have been using essential oils for a while now, and decided to get a diffuser for each room in my house. I think they are a better alternative to can aerosol cans. They are cheaper and health wise much better.I am pretty impressed with this Calily humidifier/diffuser. I love that it's white and could fit in with any room decor. I love that it's sleek and very simple to use. It comes with instructions, but if you're familiar with using one it's pretty self explanatory. The water reservoir can hold up to 100ML, which is a good amount of water. You can use this as a regular humidifier or you can add a few drops of essential oil. What I love is that once the water is low it automatically shuts off so that it doesn't short or overheat. This humidifier/diffuser also has several LED colored lights. I love all the color options. It comes with a remote so you don't have to get up to turn it on/off. I have this one placed in my laundry room to keep it smelling fresh and clean.Overall, the Calily diffuser is a simple and inexpensive diffuser and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheaper way to freshen up their home.

"There are times in your life when you just need a pack of penis straws - and it's not like you can pick these up just anywhere, it usually involves driving out of my way and having to go to one of those adult novelty stores.  While I don't mind those stores in general, I do find it challenging to find time when I can go and since I was having one of those saucy home parties I needed to go with the theme and these straws were a must.  I received this pack of 20 penis straws in exchange for my honest opinion.The straws themselves are perfectly fun and come in both pink and purple which adds a bit of flair (and less creepy than the flesh tone pack in my opinion).  Out of the 20 penis straws, 2 had tiny holes near the testicles which caused some interesting noises and tons of laughter as my girlfriends shouted things like ""oops, gotta hold the balls to make it squirt"" and other such folly.

"As someone who suffers from plantar fasciitis, I was really excited when I was offered these therapy wraps in exchange for my honest opinion.  That is, until I received them and they didn't actually reach my arches, in fact, they hardly cover my heels and it isn't like I have giant ogre feet or something, I have fairly standard size 8.5 women's feet and I'm not getting arch support if it barely covers my heel.  Now, I'm giving this two stars because it did provide nice heel and ankle compression which was comforting and if I had those problems would be helpful.

"I have a somewhat stressful day job that involves a lot of negotiating and financial aptitude, so by time I get home I am in deep need of a way to unwind and relax for a bit before I can jump into homework time with the kids, laundry, dinner and whatever else needs to be done around the house.

I received this adult coloring kit in exchange for my honest opinion.What makes the Life in Coloring adult coloring kit better than the others I have tried in the past is that it includes a hard cover and a set of 12 colored pencils ensuring that you can color any time, anywhere.  I love the varying types and styles of coloring pages included that include intricate patterns to really focus and enjoy.  I have refound my joy of blending colors, find the right style and shape and overall coming up with something beautiful.  This set is well-made and would make a wonderful gift as the presentation is quite lovely.  The pencils can be displayed in the case for easy grab-and-go or in the travel pencil case.

"If you have ever tried to travel through an airport with kids, luggage, car seats and everything else you need, you know how challenging that can be.  The first time we flew to Florida with the girls (in fact, the first time we flew with them at all), we learned that the car seats wouldnt come with us into the plane, but had to be checked baggage.  By time we got them back, they had been beat up and something spilled on them so we had to do some quick cleaning in the airport bathroom.  I wish I had this Angel Baby Car Seat Travel Bag that I just received for this review in exchange for my honest opinion, back when we first were traveling!The Angel Baby Car Seat Travel Bag should be on every baby gift registry and I know Ill be getting one for my friends as they have babies!  This handy car seat travel bag is sturdy, large and highly visible.  I particularly love that it has a shoulder strap making it easy to carry this bag through a crowded airport or other terminal without the awkward attempt at carrying a car seat AND everything else.  We recently took a train to Chicago and used this bag to transport our daughters booster seat  it was the easiest and cleanest way to transport plus with the bag being bright red, we were able to spot it quickly and without trouble at the luggage carousal.  We also tried this with our younger daughters Britax car seat and it fit in there as well  so I am confident that this will fit many styles and designs of car seats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W2I2I7TE1QFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJN7L3I#wasThisHelpful","R2W2I2I7TE1QFU","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girls have always been interested in coloring (me too, for what it is worth!), but once they hit the 5-6 year old range, they wanted something more from their coloring books including a purpose behind the ""why"" of coloring  - so a love of storybook coloring books was born.  We received this storybook coloring book Terry Treetop in exchange for my honest opinion.This coloring book features a fun and interactive storyline that will keep children engaged and interested as well as connected to the coloring book as they go along.  Coloring is a beneficial activity for children, building good hand-eye coordination in addition to giving them an activity that allows their mind to rest after a long day of school but still building skills without the stress.  The story in this coloring book is light and fun and an easy read for your K5-2nd grade range.  For children younger than that, parents can read along and join in on the fun. We really have enjoyed this storybook coloring book and look forward to future stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39CAZD3XI3NO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517363330#wasThisHelpful","R39CAZD3XI3NO2","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a somewhat anxious personality, I tend to compensate for that with snacks  so I get into a terrible catch-22 situation where I am anxious and eating and gaining weight all the time.  With a lot of changes and some losses in our family over the last few months, my anxiety has been at an all-time high and, as you can imagine, so has my weight.  I started a new workout program, but honestly, you can workout all day, everyday and without the support in the food area, that is never going to change.  So I wanted to make a change in a natural way without taking anti-anxiety medications that my doctor offered me.  I received a bottle of Chronos Pharma Super Premium Mood and Weight Support in exchange for my honest opinion.I followed the instructions to take one to two pills each night with water (I recommend this, once I missed, took it in the AM and had an upset stomach for the duration of the day).  It took about two weeks of daily use for me to really notice a difference, as though it were building in my system, though hubby says he noticed I was less worry wartish a few days before I noticed.  I have now been taking it for about a month and can say that my everyday anxiety level is significantly lower and my desire to comfort eat is close to gone. During the time of taking this, my mother-in-law had a heart attack and it was very stressful on my family, especially my husband  usually this would send me into a tizzy of anxiety, no sleep and countless bags of chips and treats.  I was able to emerge from that experience as a strong support for my husband and without needing or even craving the sweet or salty snacks to soothe anything.  It was amazing!I really like this mood and weight support dietary supplement.  For me, with a usual low level of anxiety, it worked to calm things down and allow me to control my appetite for snacks and treats.  I feel better and am even sleeping through the night (previously I would wake up one to two times just to think).  You can see the full list of ingredients on Amazon and if you think it may work for you, share the list with your doctor and see what s/he thinks  it may just help you, too*.*Please check with your medical provider before starting any supplements or stopping any current treatment prescribed to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYY6BJGUQ1BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OF2VBSO#wasThisHelpful","R2UYY6BJGUQ1BI","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being of the ""top heavy"" persuasion, I end up spending a tidy sum on my bras so that I can have both support and style, but then I wash them and my washer and/or dryer promptly try to destroy them - either by eating them entirely (where DO those things go?!?!) or by stretching out the straps, bending wires, etc.  I received this pack of laundry bags from Miss & Co in exchange for my honest opinion.You get five bags in varying sizes for all your laundry needs, including two bra bags, which honestly, were the most important to me!  I threw a bra into each and was in love after the first cycle that my bras came out clean, fresh and intact!  No more stretching or ruining for me!  The large bag is great for gathering all the socks from a load of laundry to ensure that your washer will not have a hearty sock snack during the cycle.  We are losing less underclothes than ever and I can contribute that to using these bags.  The bags are well-made, sturdy and the zipper is great too.  Since the zippers are plastic, there is no rust to worry about down the road and no snagging of your clothing that you put in.

I am able to bring all of my makeup, soaps, travel shampoo, body wash, etc all in this toiletry bag with no problem and that makes it so convenient.

"As an avid bike commuter, hubby puts about 20-25 miles per day on his bike and he does this year-round, even in the cold/snow of Wisconsin.  He has an ""old beater bike"" as he calls it for the winter to minimize wear and tear on his more expensive bike, but often complains about the seat on it.  I received this replacement bike saddle in exchange for my honest opinion.  I should say, this is a road bike style seat - so if you are a casual biker or a first time ""trying to get into shape"" rider - this is not going to feel comfortable or natural to you.  Hence why I had hubby test this out - my bike has a big, squishy seat that is for comfort, not speed.  This bike saddle is meant for those doing the road bike/commuter thing and are going for speed/agility.  For those purposes, it's quite decent.  Hubby took it on several long rides and said it was significantly better than the standard saddle that came with his cheap bike, but obviously, not as nice as his English leather one that we invested a pretty penny.  That being said, at this price point and the ease at which this installed, it is a good seat and will be perfect for the winter months for him.  It seems well-made and quite sturdy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVE9CTVPAZUO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014H62UAA#wasThisHelpful","RVE9CTVPAZUO1","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the recent US attempt at normalizing relations with Cuba, I really wanted to brush up on my history of Cuba and get into a better understanding.  Honestly, I hadn't put much thought into it since my freshman college Political Science class and that was the end of it.  I received this book in exchange for my honest opinion.Let me just say that I'm not sure this book was intended to sit down and read in large, long chunks - at least, that isn't the feeling I get based on the Q&A style that it is written in.  I really like it actually - I can scan through the contents to find a question that stands out most to me and then flip specifically to that section to read and learn exactly what I wanted to know.  The books itself is quite verbose and in some sections the author gets a bit heavy handed in her academia meets opinion, but overall I found her style to be enjoyable and informative.  I feel like I have picked up new facts and have an overall better understanding of Cuba, as well as US/Cuba relations and interactions.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking just to learn more about another area of the world, or to better understand the importance of normalizing the relations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14K907TE0EK71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199896704#wasThisHelpful","R14K907TE0EK71","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My brother travels regularly to Cuba as part of his job and has gotten to know the island fairly well.  I gave him this book after I received it in exchange for my honest opinion to get his thoughts.  I read through it and as someone who hopes to visit Cuba in the near future when my brother is there found it to be helpful in giving me ideas about things - for example, I really like the tips on when to travel to certain areas and the ""why"" behind those recommendations.  But when my brother looked it over, he noted that some things were already out of date and a bit of misinformation here or there with the ""places to go"".  He felt that most of the restaurant reviews were a bit overstated and enthusiastic, but perhaps that is because he really has gotten to know many of the locals and mostly avoids the touristy areas now.  I can appreciate that it is hard to keep a printed copy of something current particularly in a country where things change (isn't that every country?!?!) - but I will take this with me for a general guideline in January to see how it pans out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYIVVEHVDU1QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742204228#wasThisHelpful","RYIVVEHVDU1QJ","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not as often as I would like, but occasionally, hubby and I get to go on mini-getaways just the two of us.  When we head out for a short weekend away, we try to pack light and efficiently especially since we tend to travel by train and need something we can quickly throw into the overhead bins.  I received this travel bag from OXA in exchange for my honest opinion.This high quality, affordable travel bag is military style and perfect for both men or women.  Hubby likes it because it is quite stylish and doesnt look girly as he accuses my other less practical travel bags to be.  This bag is made from a combination of sturdy canvas and PU leather making the bag tough when you need it to be and looking great otherwise.I like that this travel bag can be used three different ways: as a backpack, as a messenger bag, or as a tote.  Whats more, is that when you transfer from one style to the next, everything tucks in or zips up so seamlessly that you cant tell that it was something else just moments before.  The backpack straps are sturdy and well-made and allow for a lot of abuse  weve already taken this on two trips to Chicago on the train and it holds a ton of stuff, as well as being an all-around quality travel bag that we both really liked carrying with us.  My only wish for the bag is that it were waterproof so that hubby could use it for biking this winter since it is the perfect size for his bike commuting, too  but I guess I cant have it all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WOCOUDBROX8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MDN7FE#wasThisHelpful","R1WOCOUDBROX8L","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have really started getting into making my own custom essential oil blends, the problem is that I end up having to mix in my hand or in a much bigger bottle essentially wasting oils if I don't like how a blend turns out.  The perfect solution is for a tiny sample size bottle and I have found a great, affordable option with these essential oil bottles that I received in exchange for my honest opinion.These bottles are about 3mL in size, so it is perfect for whipping up tiny blends to sample and try or to share with friends and family.  The bottles are amber, so they are protected from sun damage.  The lids hold tight and there is no leaking - bonus.  I also like that the bottles are very hearty - I have dropped more than one on the floor and they have held up beautifully.If you like to make your own essential oil blends, I recommend picking up a pack of these bottles as a way to test out blends for mixing up bigger batches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I108VHTXSXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145ESORW#wasThisHelpful","R2I108VHTXSXK","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I received this silicone baseplate in exchange for my honest opinion.  I love this baseplate!  It is silicone so it is squishy and easy to store - it rolls up cleanly for storage or travel, but it holds steady when rolled out for building.  It really does give a good space for building and works with both standard LEGOS and DUPLOS -though we have used it most recently for the new LEGO Star Wars sets that our oldest received for Halloween.

"About once a week, I go in for a chair massage at the same place and have done so for two years.  A month ago, after my massage, they showed me a sign indicating that the business was relocating out of state and I would need to find a new place - I was bummed.  That is, until one of the massage therapists texted me to say she was starting her own acupressure massage business so I headed in.  Because she is a new business owner and trying to throw it together quickly for the sake of clients who were missing her services.  My first visit she had the massage chairs all set up, but was using paper towels for the headrest covers.  This worked ok, but it deeson't cover the full headrest and they are quite rough.  I received this pack of Earthlite disposable headrest covers in exchange for my honest opinion so I took them over to her to put them to the test!I have to say, as a customer, I am loving these headrest covers!  They are soft, gentle on my skin and very comfortable - while still allowing me to breath.  They fit the chair well, so it allows for a sanitary experience that, I, as the consumer appreciate especially during cold and flu season.  At around $0.20 each cover (at the current price on Amazon, check as those can change frequently), you aren't adding a lot to your overhead and those receiving the massage will be happy to have a clean and comfortable place to rest their face while getting a massage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6IF7P6582FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00122JE66#wasThisHelpful","RH6IF7P6582FY","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've ever needed to decorate for a party of any sort, you know how quickly that cost can get out of hand and usually you end up with the same old stuff since options are limited.  My favorite way to decorate for parties now is using chalkboard markers to create custom and reusable items for each event!  I have invested in chalkboard paint, chalkboard signs and stickers to make different ""props"" and combine them with lovely chalkboard markers to create whimsical signs and decor that my guests will remember!I received this set of chalkboard markers from US Art Supply in exchange for my honest opinion.  This set is a great starter for all your decorating needs - it includes 10 colors (all of the rainbow plus brown,white and black).  Why black you ask?  Since most chalkboards are black?  Well, turns out chalkboard markers and windows are wonderful friends and these markers are a bit bigger so they are perfect for just such an occasion.  They are also waterbased so it will wipe off without issue (bonus!).  I plan on using them to draw a Thanksgiving feast on the window in my dining room for the fall as a fun and different type of decoration in that room.  I could also see using these to write on the windows in the car as something for the kids to do on long trips and let them write and wipe off to their heart's content.These are vibrant chalkboard markers that look great, have very little dripping and once you get the flow going, they work great.  They also come with a spare set of tips to let you write in wider or more narrow ""font"" - I haven't needed to change mine yet, but it is a nice option to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHOB360HRK0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UZ7OEA#wasThisHelpful","R1WHOB360HRK0S","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a kid, I would sit and color for HOURS - I found it soothing, but then over time, much like many things of childhood, it sort of faded out of my realm and was replaced with other things.  I recently was introduced to the concept of adult coloring books - coloring books like the ones we remember as children, but instead of large photos of beloved characters or scenes from fairy tales, they are intricate designs and shapes meant to captivate and engage the adult mind.  I am hooked!  I received this adult coloring book in exchange for my honest opinion - my opinions, as always, remain 100% honest and 100% my own.I love this coloring book!  It features 50 Mandala Patterns that will take you hours to color (provided you are focused for symmetry and style like me!).  I love how I can get into a coloring ""zone"" and really let my mind relax and enjoy myself - to set aside the stresses of the day and think only of coloring within the lines.This book is beautifully put together and each page is single sided so if you are using pens (I favor gel pens and colored pencils mostly!) it won't bleed through the back to another page.  As an added bonus you get access to additional printable coloring pages so your fun doesn't just end when you fill up the book.  I am seeing this as the perfect secret santa gift for several people this year - and an affordable one at that!  This beautiful adult coloring book combined with a pack of lovely colored pencils for the gift that gives relaxation for all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PNJV4FY1GSXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517051029#wasThisHelpful","R3PNJV4FY1GSXF","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's funny, we spend tons of time coloring as kids, and then BAM! We stop because, well, I don't know why, but I was glad when my kids came into the coloring age so I could color with them again for sure!  One of my favorite things to color and doodle with ""back in the day"" and still to this day, are gel coloring pens.  I received this 24 pack of gel coloring pens in exchange for my honest opinion.This is a vibrant and wide variety set of gel coloring pens including 12 Glitter, 6 Neon and 6 Pastel pens in varying shades of colors.  I found that these pens color very smoothly without any ""gooping"" or leaving of a messy trail.  I've also had very little clogging with these pens - even the glitter ones color and write very smoothly without clogging indicating to me that the top is well thought out.  These gel coloring pens are also non-toxic and free from acid, which makes me feel a ton better about sharing them with my children.My favorite part is how these pens have 40% more ink and not from making the pen body itself bigger, but from expanding the ink tube on the INSIDE of the pen!  More pink, more coloring time and less money spent - LOVE IT!These gel coloring pens would make a fabulous gift for the child, teenager or adult who loves to color in your life.  They are also lovely for scrapbooking or photo labeling as they could add some colorful flair that looks great and will last a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DC8LFLIYCU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT641W8#wasThisHelpful","R10DC8LFLIYCU8","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was not blessed with long, lush, dark lashes like some others in my family.  In fact, mine have some length, but they are so light you can't see them and if I happen to forget to put on mascara or eyeliner, I have to endure people asking me all day about my health and if I am ill or not.  So I definitely love having quality mascaras and have tried a few of the 3D lash ones, but find many can get crazy in pricing.  I received this natural 3D lash mascara in exchange for my honest opinion.This 3D lash mascara comes with the two products that you need to have fuller, longer looking lashes in just minutes (with some practice!).  One is the liquid mascara (and also plays the part of sealant) and the other is the 3d lash fibers that give you that faux fabulous lash look.  What I like most about this brand of 3D lash mascara is that the product is made without parabens or SLS - which I appreciate knowing I'm not coating the delicate area around my eyes with things like that.  I found that these applied very easily and I like the wand for applying the fibers.  I was excited that even with the first application I didn't have any flaking and my lashes appeared longer, fuller and overall very nice.  Great 3D lash mascara - I would definitely buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICKYLE87IAWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012F232DC#wasThisHelpful","R3ICKYLE87IAWE","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a black lab/beagle mix and he LOVES to chew on ropes but can get them undone very quickly.  I received this set of dog rope toys in exchange for my honest opinion.  As someone who loves jungle animal everything, I found these to be super cute and different than most of the rope toys out there - it also gave us a chance to ""name"" the toys so he would know which one to get ""Go get your giraffey"" etc.These rope toys are a mixed review for me - they are cute and the stretch in them makes them extra great for tug-of-war and pulling, but there are also small pieces that can become a problem if your dog is a quick chewer, like ours is.  He had the legs, tail and ears off of both rope toy animals within an hour and I was worried he would choke on these small pieces.  Once we got those away from him and he was left with quadruple amputee animals, he has been very happy and I am impressed with the durability and design of the bodies of these toys.  So we like these toys, of course, ropes are great for dogs' teeth and he finds them to be fun - but if I buy them again in the future, I'd have to remember to watch for those small nubbies that are somewhat troublesome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D665W173EPAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEGET7A#wasThisHelpful","R3D665W173EPAF","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have wiped it down daily with a microfiber cloth and it looks great.

With just a short amount of time, our dog has stopped running out of the yard or seeking to run to everyone who comes to our door.

"It's funny how trends come and go and then come and go again - like stroller size.

"Over the last year, I have really gotten into focusing on getting my workouts in.  One simple and inexpensive workout that was recommended to me was jump rope - so I was immediately taken back to my days of school and sing-song versions of Miss Mary Mack while jumping, as it turns out, jump rope is harder now that I am in my 30s and have birthed a couple of kiddos.  I also tend to give myself more credit for the jumps that I am doing (oh yeah, I totally jumped 100 times) - but now that I received this jump rope in exchange for my honest opinion, it turns out I did not jump that many times, more like 30 - WOW, that is hard!  I like this particular jump rope because it keeps track of your jumps, but it is adjustable for many heights - from someone around 6 feet tall all the way down to being sized for my kiddos (who enjoy taking this to a competitive extreme!).  We did find that at the longer lengths for taller people, it tangled more easily and you couldn't jump as quickly due to that, but at the shorter, more child-size settings, you got longer jump times in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJJZ77Q54FFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SOK1NU#wasThisHelpful","R1NJJZ77Q54FFJ","A19ZXM03SIBK9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXM03SIBK9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Full Circle Grunge Buster Grout and Tile Brush is a unique scrub brush that is optimally designed for one job, and one job only.The Grunge Buster Brush has a long, slender row of white bristles connected to a purple plastic base that loops around to a wooden handle on the other end.  That evenly looped-back form also serves a nifty purpose--the brush can stably stand up on it's bottom edge and allow the bristles to dry without any mildewy build-up.  I really liked this simple, yet impressive feature.  There is an additional row beige bristles that flank the each side of the white ones nearly halfway through the base to increase the scrubbing area.  I was amazed by how well I could work the slender white bristle row into the grout spaces of tile or into crevasses of my other single-panel shower. The pinpoint accuracy and effectiveness for hitting those tiny spots was great with this brush.  However, I have to recommend against using this as an all-purpose bathroom brush for all surfaces.  It just doesn't have a wide enough bristle base to clean large, non-tiled areas. Having a full-sized brush alternative is so much more efficient to clean a large, flat surface.  Given that this brush is being marketed as a cleaning supply that can take care of the grout between tiled surfaces, I can't knock it a star there.  Still, I had to drop the brush from 5-stars down to 4 because of the wooden handle.  Blasting away the gunk that builds up in grout takes some effort, and the wooden handle isn't all the comfortable while applying a lot of pressure.  After some hard scrubbing I was wishing for a softer, plasticky type handle.  I can appreciate the visual touch the wood provides, but c'mon, it's brush, and we should all primarily care about function over aesthetics.  Additionally, I found that while wet, my hand would slide around on the wooden handle more than a comparable plastic-handled brush.  Maintaining a perfect grip wasn't easy.Overall, the Full Circle Grunge Buster is an effective brush to clean away tile grout.  I loved the accuracy of the bristles and the edge-standing capabilities.  I just think I'd also probably keep a larger scrub brush in your cleaning supply bin to complement this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPME3TU6O5Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ILL5IW#wasThisHelpful","R1OPME3TU6O5Y5","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Arm Tunnel Micro Cloud Pillow probably looked good on paper in the design shop, but somehow isn't as fantastic as I hoped.  In theory, the idea of a pillow that has a built-in space for your arm is a great concept (primarily for stomach or side sleepers).  However, the pillow is questionably constructed, marginally comfortable, and oddly noisy as you change positions.  It's not bad for lounging on the couch, but it's not great for an 8 hour sleep session.Pros:*  Somewhat comfortable*  Shapes to head and neck*  Arm space is helpful, if you don't move around a lot when sleeping.  I started sleeping on my stomach, with my arm neatly placed in the arm space for this pillow. However, once I started moving around and changing positions, I ended up bunching up the pillow in the same way I would bunch up a regular pillow.  Maybe that's more my fault, which is why I still considered this a Pro and not a true Con.Cons:*  Wished it was more comfortable and the beads didn't bunch up on one side a lot*  Not a lot of consistent support compared to other pillows*  Noisy - the little beads in the pillow shift around a lot when sleeping and are surprisingly noisy*  Although the stitching is okay and the seams are fine, the cover material feels overly smooth and cheesyOverall, I give this pillow a 3 out of 5.  It's not the worst pillow I've slept on by any means, but it's not as great as I was hoping for.  As the title shows, there was less sleeping soundly and more random sounds during sleeping.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VK1ULB1XQIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D45ZRZQ#wasThisHelpful","R16VK1ULB1XQIT","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is a great product, however, as it only costs a little over $119, you shouldn't have to buy a $35 case to protect it.  That's where this cost effective neoprene sleeve from Gizmo Dorks comes in.  It fits the Paperwhite with only a little bit of give--so it's easy to slide in and out, but it offers solid protection because the Kindle won't be sliding around all over the place inside the sleeve.  The extra zipper pouch up front can easily hold a USB cord for charging.  You can cram an AC wall plug adapter in there too, but that becomes a really tight fit and I worry about it damaging the Paperwhite.I primarily use the sleek, black and red-highlighted sleeve to keep my Kindle from getting dusty when it sits on my desk for a week or more when not in use.  I also will put my Paperwhite in the sleeve and then toss it into my laptop bag for travel.  The neoprene sleeve sitting in my bag has so far successfully protected my Paperwhite over the span of 5 months during 8 flights and countless driving and train trips.  If you're careful with your electronic devices, you probably don't need a fancy $35 cover for the Paperwhite and can use this sleeve to put your Kindle into your main bag without worrying about scratches and small dings.  Additionally, the zippers seem highly durable and should last a long time with normal wear and tear.Overall, I feel like you can't go wrong when buying something this affordable for your Paperwhite.  It's a cheap investment to protect your Kindle at a price that makes sense.  One final note...they throw in a free carabiner with purchase, but it's nearly worthless and shouldn't be considered when making the decision to buy this neoprene sleeve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SE80GTEHA314/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098QDGS0#wasThisHelpful","R1SE80GTEHA314","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Logitech Wireless MK270 is a simplistic wireless keyboard and mouse combo that offers no-frills productivity at an extremely affordable price point.To orientate everyone looking at this review, this is by no means Logitech's best keyboard+mouse package (I use the Logitech Wireless Wave Combo Mk550 With Keyboard and Laser Mouse (920-002555) for my 8-hour/day office duty).  However, if you're looking for a wireless keyboard+mouse solution that gets the job done, the MK270 absolutely works.  The small nano-receiver fits into any USB port and doesn't take up any space, so you can still plug in bulky flash drives into the USB slots next to it.  The keyboard and mouse both have easy access power buttons that allow you to shut them down at the end of the day to save battery juice.  The keyboard keys travel a satisfying distance with each stroke for good accuracy, and they produce a comforting amount of clicky noise.  There are a couple dedicated buttons at the top of the keyboard to control media functions and launch email, but there's not a lot extra happening with this keyboard.The minimalistic mouse is cut from the same cloth as the keyboard.  It simply gets the job done.  The accuracy on the mouse is sufficient for web browsing and typical Office work, however, it is not a laser mouse.  So if you want pixel perfect movements for video games or Photoshop, you'll want something with a little better tracking.The MK270 also lacks the built-in ergonomic wrist rest of the MK550, so you might want to consider buying a wrist rest pad to complement the MK270 if you're using it for extended time periods.  But if you have a computer hooked up to your TV and need a cheap keyboard to use on the couch, this works like a champ.  One final thing to note, if you're buying this for light usage (which should be the targeted use), I recommend simply plugging in the receiver and typing away.  For anything more than light usage, I recommend going to the Logitech website and downloading the SetPoint software to gain some functionality and customization options for the combo unit.  It takes up a little extra RAM as the trade-off, but it's worth it for medium-to-heavy users.In summary, the MK270 is a perfect, low-cost combo solution for people that need a wireless keyboard and mouse for less than 1-3 consecutive hours of daily light usage. Hence my five star rating above. If you're planning on using this combo unit for a daily, full work day, then you should think of it as a 3-star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S872A2AN63KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BP5KOPA#wasThisHelpful","R1S872A2AN63KJ","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The OXO Good Grips Double Flip in Hamper is a high quality product, but it has a price tag to match.Like many OXO products, this hamper is built to do it's single purpose very well.  The entire unit is cloth covered cardboard and is durable and sturdy.  Simply open up the hamper, fold down the two flaps that offer bottom support and then put the lid INSIDE the hamper.  If you put the lid on the outside of the hamper it only loosely hold it's shape.  Once assembled, it's as sold as any plastic hamper, really.  There are two handle on the outside which makes it easy to carry from your bedroom closet to your laundry room and the lid pops on and off for easy access.  While not a negative, the only caveat is that you can't throw your dirty clothes in the hamper.  The flip-down lid requires you to gently push your dirty clothes down into the black or light gray dividers.  Again, it's not horrible, but something to be aware of if you prefer to toss your clothes in from a distance.In summary, the OXO Good Grips Hamper is undoubtedly the best hamper I've ever used and I'm guessing you'll feel the same way if you decide to purchase one. It's simply a personal question if a fantastic hamper is worth this much to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSIKPRKUZA7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CP41T8G#wasThisHelpful","R1PSIKPRKUZA7P","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The LG GA7900 is a great looking panel loaded with a GoogleTV operating system that isn't quite fully baked.  LG also makes the LG Electronics 42GA6400 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Google TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses (GA6400) series of televisions, which I recently reviewed on Amazon.  Some of the features are identical between those two GoogleTV series, so parts of my review will be recycled, but I will point out the differences in the GA7900 below so you can compare and contrast the two units while you're shopping.HARDWAREI'll start with the physical specifications of the television first.  Assembly of the stand is pretty typical for LCD sets, and I had no problem attaching the 8 screws required to get the TV in an upright position by myself.  I would have preferred a base with a standard X pattern, but the two ""arms coming out to hug you"" stand is stable enough and doesn't take up a huge footprint.  It's somewhat of a bummer, but the stand lacks a tilt/rotation capability.  There are 4 HDMI inputs on the side of the TV, a headphone output, an optical out, 3 USB inputs, and some 1/8"" jacks that allow you to plug in composite and component in cables via the supplied adapters.  There is an additional 1/8"" jack for the IR blaster adapter (also supplied--it's a Y-adapter with two IR blasters connected to the same jack).  There is also an ethernet jack and a coax cable input for direct standard cable signal or an over-the-air antenna.  All of these inputs are on the left side of the TV (oriented while you're facing the LCD screen). The 3-prong, grounded power cord is attached to the opposite side of the TV from the inputs.  Unfortunately, I feel like the power cord could be a little longer.  The frame is slightly slimmer and has an angular, and more aggressively styled bezel on the GA7900 compared to the very squared-off shape of the GA6400, but it looks cool.  The sound on the GA7900 has a little more bass and ""oomph"" than the GA6400, but they're still stock TV speakers and nothing to get excited about.PICTUREI received the 47 inch version of the GA7900 for review.  It's a full 1080p, LED edgelit screen.  While I can't find specifics on the technology used, the GA7900 boasts some degree of local microdimming.  The result is a dramatic difference between the GA7900 and GA6400 in terms of black levels and contrast.  The GA7900 does an excellent job of producing something close to a ""true"" black on an LCD with a substantial contrast range.  Basically, most of the cost and performance difference between the GA7900 and GA6400 is located here, as the picture is significantly improved in the 7900.  I was also impressed with the clean black around the edges of the panel.  I didn't detect any noticeable light bleeding out near the bezel.  You'll have to move up to the very high-end (and more expensive) microdimming Samsung F8000s, Sony XBRs and Sharp ELITEs to reach better black levels on an LCD.  And of course, good plasma TV tech still produces the best blacks. Color reproduction on the GA7900 is very good compared to similarly priced sets.  Reds and greens have an appropriate amount of saturation and color accuracy.  I didn't find anything looking too warm or too cool.  The 240Hz refresh rate holds up well versus similarly priced sets and does a commendable job handling live sporting events.  I only noticed minimal digital motion blur during very fast NHL hockey action.  Overall, the GA7900's panel pretty much performs as well as anything in its price range.3DThis LG comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses (similar to the glasses you get in a movie theatre).  Since my 3D options are somewhat limited, I ordered a free OnDemand viewing of Ice Age 4 in 3D.  I enjoyed the 3D effect and I never experienced any cross-signal.  The 3D viewing angle isn't that wide, but you can maintain a quality depth effect if you're sitting  within 45 degrees away from straight-on.  I was surprised that I wound up preferring this passive 3D effect over my active-shutter 3D glasses I use with my Samsung ES7500.  It's also nice that you don't have to worry about putting batteries in the glasses.  The 3D here works more or less as well as the GA6400.REMOTEIf you're reading this review the reason you're considering this TV is because it's a Google TV.  Well, really, the GoogleTV software goes hand-in-hand with this iteration of the LG magic remote (the remote is the same for the GA6400and GA7900).  LG made an incredible remote for this TV, however, they also annoyed me to no end by not going the extra mile and including a couple simple, intuitive features.  First, the good...the keyboard works great and is so much better than trying to type out search phrases in a SmartTV with a D-pad.  The pointer works very well.  It's basically a poor-man's version of a Wiimote.  Some of the features, like holding down the gesture button and air-drawing semi-circles to zoom in can be next to useless, but for the majority of the GoogleTV interface this remote is a wonderful match.  Unfortunately, the remote has problems whenever I try to use my Comcast DVR.  There are times when I want to use my DVR's channel guide (see below) and unfortunately, this remote does NOT have page up and page down buttons.  This problem could be alleviated if LG can fix the firmware and allow a single click of the scroll wheel down to send a ""page down"" signal to the DVR through the IR blaster.  The other main issue is that, amazingly, there is no STOP button.  There is a separate play and a separate pause button, but no stop.  Why not make one button PLAY/PAUSE and the other button STOP?  When I'm watching DVR video I need the stop button to get me out of the program I'm watching and give me the option to delete it.  Instead, all I can do is pause, and then hit BACK, which takes me all the way out of the DVR menu structure.  It's annoying.  Buried within the menus is the ability to assign functions to the red, yellow, green, and blue buttons, but I tried to assign the page up and down functions and it didn't work.  There is a lot of empty space on the front of the remote.  Why didn't LG add a couple more buttons for page up/down and stop...and even 0-9 while they're at it?  The other minor things I miss are having a backlit display and a ""flashback"" button to flick back and forth between two channels.  Finally, some keys have secondary functions, but they are written in a tiny red font that is nearly impossible for me to see and probably invisible to people with red-green color blindness.GOOGLE TVObviously, this is the differentiator for LG's GA series of televisions.  If you ask me is it worth paying a little extra cash for a GA model over a competitive panel with the same picture quality to have GoogleTV built-in, my answer as of June 2013 would be---not yet.  Hopefully some software and firmware updates will soon change that answer to a definitive YES.  GoogleTV essentially tries to overlay its interface on top of your DVR's interface and cable (or satellite) signal.  When you start up your GoogleTV, you are required to log in with a Google account.  Not a fan of Google's privacy policies?  Too bad, you'll have to deal with it.  The main purpose of your account is to provide access to the Google store for app downloads to your TV.  Once you're logged in, you calibrate the unit to the type of TV signal you receive, what area you're in, and whether or not your receive premium channels.  From there it takes a few minutes to load, but GoogleTV takes over and provides you with its channel guide.  The GoogleTV channel guide is similar to Apple's cover flow for music.  Instead of seeing a common spreadsheet grid from your DVR, you instead thumb through mini-images of movie and TV show posters.  At first glance, it seems like a much more intuitive way to find content.  However, it only works well for live TV and shows that are going to start within 5 minutes.  You won't see shows that are going to begin in an hour.  On a normal DVR channel grid, I can flick around and randomly notice a program that will come on in one hour.  At that point in time, I can either choose to record it or plan to watch it.  With GoogleTV, you are instead supposed to know what you want to watch and use the keyboard or voice search to find it.  The search will find it on upcoming TV listings, Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, etc (there is no Hulu Plus on this set as of June 2013).  The difference is that you have to know what you are looking for ahead of time.  While using GoogleTV, a double press of the Guide button will send you to the DVR channel grid, but without the aforementioned page up/down buttons navigating is an imprecise chore.  The TV has a 2-hour sleep feature to keep its content up-to-date.  If you shut off the TV and come back an hour later you won't miss a beat.  If you shut off the TV and return the next day, it can take 30 seconds to 5 minutes for the Guide to update and be ready to use.The GooglePlay app store is...weird.  Within the app store I can click GAMES and I'm taken to a page that shows subheadings for featured items, editor's picks, etc.  Except that there are zero, and I literally mean zero apps on these pages.  It's as if the store is empty.  However, if I search within the store for ""solitaire,"" I'm given the option to download a game that works on the TV.  Once again, you need to know exactly what you're looking for.  There are a very limited number of apps, though.  I believe the problem is that GoogleTV is running a variant of Android 3.2 instead of the 4.X running on most phones and tablets for 2012-2013.  I have no idea if an upgrade to 4.X will provide more apps.  Of the apps that are there, it's a somewhat mixed bag.  The internet browser is amazingly not horrible for a TV, thanks in large part to the keypad remote with scroll wheel and Wii-like pointer.  I had a difficult time with streaming services, though.  Short YouTube clips have worked well, but AmazonPrime hasn't been perfect.  At first, I searched for ""Avengers,"" and Google directed me to an option to watch a comprehensive list of movies that I could pay for or watch for free.  That search part is wonderful.  I selected the movie, Thor, because it was free through my Amazon Prime subscription.  I was able to get through the whole movie, but there were 2 instances where I had to wait for buffer loading in HD.  While not perfect, recent updates in the AmazonVideo app have dramatically improved streaming performance and it gives me hope that a few more software/firmware updates will really improve GoogleTV.SUMMARYIn conclusion, the GA7900 is a very good television.  The panel's picture quality and its ability to compete against similarly priced sets on the market today is why I'm giving this product a 5-star review.  You could still simply use this set like any other TV and choose to ignore the GoogleTV features and be pleased with the picture (you'll still need to create that Google account, though).  My only caveat is that the GoogleTV functionality as of June 2013 still has a ways to go before it can fully and precisely interact with a DVR's menus, or altogether replace them.  The software has some cool advantages with its image-based content scrolling, but it's still too limited in its current form.  Hopefully Google can update the software to Android 4.X (rumored to happen later in 2013), and offer ways to stumble onto TV programs without me needing to know exactly what I want to watch.  The remote is one step away from being one of the best gadgets of the year, but the lack of just a couple buttons is a mind-blowing admission.  It would be great if LG can provide some new firmware to perhaps assign more functions to the colored remote buttons.  The mystical TV-watching experience I was hoping for is so tantalizing close, but yet remains beyond the reach of my magic remote clenched hand.(If Google/LG push out significant upgrades I'll try to update this review).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMR5AIW67AJJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBAFWMO#wasThisHelpful","RMR5AIW67AJJ8","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups, Stainless Steel, Updated Design deliver all of the things you expect from OXO products - ergonomic design, sturdy construction, form and function.Pros:- The measuring cups have rubber handles that are easy to grip, especially when your hands are wet or sticky from baking mishaps.  The rubber handles also make it easier to hold the cups when washing them.- The cups are held together by a plastic ring that keeps them from getting separated and lost in the drawer.  You can detach the measuring cups from the ring when you need to use them, but it's a nice feature to be able to reconnect them for storage purposes.- The measuring cups are stainless steel, so they're durable.  I have my share of cutesy, porcelain, decorative measuring cups that look great on the shelf, but don't exactly hold up to the frantic, last-minute baking that I so often do.  These will hold up to a little heating if necessary, you can bang them against a stainless steel mixing bowl to tap out ingredients in a rush, and they'll survive being thrown in the sink with all of your other baking gadgets and spatulas.  Perhaps I should be a bit gentler with my baking equipment, but these measuring cups can handle the punishment.Cons:- The shape of the measuring cups allows them to fit into almost all of my containers and canisters for flour, sugar, etc.  However, I have a few glass jars that are a bit too narrow for these measuring cups, so it was somewhat of a struggle to measure the ingredients.  I have some other measuring cups in my baking arsenal that will fit into these jars, so it was disappointing that these didn't fit.  It's not enough of a problem to subtract a star from the rating, since it's probably more my fault for buying glass jars with narrow openings, but I thought it was worth pointing out.In the end, I give these measuring cups a 5 out of 5.  They are durable and should last a long time.  They're easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to locate in a cluttered drawer of baking supplies.  OXO does not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBQDGJSCSAFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004OCO9#wasThisHelpful","R2IBQDGJSCSAFN","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The LG 42GA6400 is a mixture of solid performance and underdeveloped promise.  At the time of this review (May 2013), the 42GA6400 is a 4-star television.  I put that disclaimer up front because I firmly believe that some thoughtful software fixes could definitely bump this TV up to 5-stars.HARDWAREI'll start with the physical specifications of the television first.  Assembly of the stand is pretty typical for LCD sets, and I had no problem attaching the 8 screws required to get the TV in an upright position by myself.  I would have preferred a base with a standard X pattern, but the two ""arms coming out to hug you"" stand is stable enough and doesn't take up a huge footprint.

There is also a coax cable input for direct standard cable signal or an over-the-air antenna.  The 3-prong, grounded power cord is attached to the opposite side of the TV from the inputs.  Unfortunately, I feel like the power cord could be a good 1-2 feet longer.  The frame is about an inch in each direction around the screen, and is made of a pretty slick, metallic-looking gray plastic.PICTUREThe 42 inch panel on this TV holds up well against similar $750-900 competition (obviously scale up the cost on 47-55 inch models).  It's a full 1080p LED backlit screen.  There is no microdimming from the LEDs, and as a result the best black it can produce is a dark, dark gray.  I didn't have any issues with lighting bleed around the bezel or at the edge of the screen.  Still, the black levels and contrast are consistent with panels in this price range.  You'll have to drop another couple hundred to get better contrast.  I do find the color reproduction to be very good compared to similarly priced sets.  Reds and greens have an appropriate amount of saturation, but due to the limited dynamic contrast the overall picture just lacks a little bit of vibrancy.  I watched NBA and NHL playoffs on the set, and I was pleasantly surprised with the ability of the 120Hz refresh to keep up with most of the action.  Hockey still had some noticeable digital motion blur, but by no means was it bad.  Overall, the screen slightly exceeded my expectations for this price range.3DI don't watch much 3D because content is limited and there are rarely any live sporting events that transmit a 3D signal.  This LG comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses (similar to the glasses you get in a movie theatre).  Since my 3D options are somewhat limited, I fired up Green Lantern in 3D (yes, I know the movie is awful) and put on the glasses.  Wow.  For a TV the 3D effect was solid and I never experienced any cross-signal.  The 3D viewing angle isn't that wide, but you can maintain a quality depth effect if you're sitting 30-45 degrees away from straight-on.  Again, I was surprised that I wound up preferring this passive 3D effect over my active-shutter 3D glasses I use with my Samsung ES7500.  It's also nice that you don't have to worry about putting batteries in the glasses as well.REMOTEIf you're reading this review the reason you're considering this TV is because it's a Google TV.  Well, really, the GoogleTV software goes hand-in-hand with this iteration of the LG magic remote.  LG made an incredible remote for this TV, however, they also annoyed me to no end by not going the extra mile and including a couple simple, intuitive features.  First, the good...the keyboard works great and is so much better than trying to type out search phrases in a SmartTV with a D-pad.  The pointer works very well.  It's basically a poor-man's version of a Wiimote.  Some of the features, like holding down the gesture button and air-drawing semi-circles to zoom in can be next to useless, but for the majority of the GoogleTV interface this remote is a wonderful match.  Unfortunately, the remote has problems whenever I try to use my Comcast DVR.  There are times when I want to use my DVR's channel guide (see below) and unfortunately, this remote does NOT have page up and page down buttons.  This problem could be alleviated if LG can fix the firmware and allow a single click of the scroll wheel down to send a ""page down"" signal to the DVR through the IR blaster.  The other issue is that, amazingly, there is no STOP button.  There is a separate play and a separate pause button, but no stop.  Why not make one button PLAY/PAUSE and the other button STOP?  When I'm watching DVR video I need the stop button to get me out of the program I'm watching and give me the option to delete it.  Instead, all I can do is pause, and then hit BACK, which takes me all the way out of the DVR menu structure.  It's annoying.  Buried within the menus is the ability to assign functions to the red, yellow, green, and blue buttons, but I tried to assign this page up and down functions and it didn't work.  There is a lot of empty space on the front of the remote.  Why didn't LG add a couple more buttons for page up/down and stop...and even 0-9 while they're at it?GOOGLE TVObviously, this is the differentiator for this set.  If you ask me is it worth paying roughly an extra $100 over a competitive panel with the same picture quality to have GoogleTV built-in, my answer as of May 2013 would be---not yet.  Hopefully some software and firmware updates will soon change that answer to a definitive YES.  Basically, GoogleTV tries to interact with your DVR and essentially overlay its interface on top of DVR's interface and cable (or satellite) signal.  When you start up your GoogleTV, you are required to log in with a Google account.  Not a fan of Google's privacy policies?  Too bad.  The main thing is that your account gives you access to the Google store so that you can load up your TV with apps.  Once you're logged in, you calibrate the TV to the type of TV signal you receive, what area you're in, and whether or not your receive premium channels.  From there it takes a few minutes to load, but GoogleTV takes over and provides you with its channel guide.  The GoogleTV channel guide is similar to Apple's cover flow for music.  Instead of seeing a common spreadsheet grid from your DVR, you instead thumb through mini-images of movie and TV show posters.  At first glance, it seems like a much more intuitive way to find content.  However, it only works well for live TV and shows that are going to start within 5 minutes or so.  You won't see shows that are going to begin in an hour.  On a normal DVR channel grid, I can flick around and see that a program will come on an hour from now.  I can either record it or plan to watch it.  With GoogleTV, you are instead supposed to know what you want to watch and use the keyboard or voice search to find it.  The search will find it on upcoming TV listings, Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, etc.  The difference is that you have to know what you are looking for ahead of time.  While using GoogleTV, a double press of the Guide button will send you to the DVR channel grid, but without the aforementioned page up/down buttons navigating is an imprecise chore.  The TV has a 2-hour sleep feature to keep its content up-to-date.  If you shut off the TV and come back and hour later you won't miss a beat.  If you shut off the TV and return the next day, it can take 30 seconds to 5 minutes for the Guide to update and be ready to use.The GooglePlay app store is...weird.  Within the app store I can click GAMES and I'm taken to a page that shows featured items, or editor's picks.  Except that there are zero, and I literally mean zero apps on these pages.  It's as if the store is empty.  However, if I search within the store for ""solitaire,"" I'm given the option to download a game that works on the TV.  Once again, you need to know exactly what you're looking for.  There are a very limited number of apps, though.  I believe the problem is that GoogleTV is running a variant of Android 3.2 instead of the 4.X running on most phones and tablets for 2012-2013.  I have no idea if an upgrade to 4.X will provide more apps.  Of the apps that are there, it's a somewhat mixed bag.  The internet browser is amazingly not horrible for a TV, thanks in large part to the keypad remote with scroll wheel and Wii-like pointer.  I had a difficult time with streaming services, though.  Short YouTube clips worked well, but AmazonPrime had a rough start.  At first, I searched for ""Justified,"" and Google directed me to an option to watch free season 2 episodes via my Amazon Prime subscription.  Great!  UGH...except that streaming was unwatchable with constant buffering pauses in HD and even in SD.  After taking 21 minutes to watch the first 10 minutes of the show because of horrible buffering lag, I shut off the TV, fired up my Samsung ES7500 (which was positioned right next to this LG) and was able to stream the same episode from the same source, in HD, with no lag.  I was going to post my review last week and drop it another star, but just recently there was an update that dramatically improved the performance.  I still had 4 buffering incidents in a 1-hour long show, but it was at least watchable now.  It gives me hope that a few more software/firmware updates will really improve this TV.SUMMARYOverall, the LG 42GA6400 is a competitive TV in the $750-900 price range (scale the 47-55 inch units appropriately).  The picture is solid and the hardware looks good.  The remote is one step away from being one of the best gadgets of the year, but the lack of just a couple buttons is a mind-blowing admission.  The software has some cool advantages with its image-based content scrolling, but it's still too limited in its current form.  If Google can update the software to Android 4.X (rumored to happen late summer 2013), offer ways to stumble onto TV programs without me needing to know exactly what I want to watch, and if LG can provide some new firmware to improve WiFi streaming and perhaps assign more functions to the colored remote buttons--we might have a 5-star winner here.  But until that time, the functions fall just short.  You're still getting a good set; it's just not the magical TV experience I was hoping for.(If Google/LG push out significant upgrades I'll try to update this review).UPDATEThere's been some minor updates to the OS and several apps.  The Google Play store now lists a few featured apps under the headings (instead of nothing), but apps are still woefully underrepresented.  There is no Hulu app, nor is there an Xfinity app.  And HBO GO is incompatible with this GoogleTV.  I wanted to catch up on Game of Thrones, but the app just sends to you the Chrome browser-based website and nothing loads. I doubt HBO GO gets fixed until (if?) GoogleTV gets updated to Android 4.X.X.  On the bright side, Amazon Prime is working much smoother than before, and the Zillow app with the magic remote is really fantastic if you're house hunting.2ND UPDATEThe second gen Google TVs from LG just got updated to an Android 4.2.2 variant in the past week.  The update took about 15 mins to download and install.  The GooglePlay store has a few more apps available when you open it, but Hulu Plus and HBO GO are still missing at the moment (end of Oct 2013).  However, with the new update in place, I have much greater hope that we'll see better apps coming soon to this device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEU9CJVR4XA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBAFUNA#wasThisHelpful","RIEU9CJVR4XA8","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Heartmath 6400 Inner Balance Sensor is a unique and interesting product, but it's value and usefulness to each user will probably vary.The 6400 is an overall quality product.  There's not too much in the box, just a 30-pin connector with a 1/8"" jack and a corresponding male 1/8"" cord with a clip sensor.  Heartmath also included a drawstring pouch to carry the sensor--a thoughtful touch.  To begin, I went to the app store and searched ""heartmath"" to find the free, 70+ MB app.  Curiously, the app says it's optimized for the iPhone 5, yet the connector won't work with an iPhone 5 (the box states it will work with a 30-pin to lightening adapter, but I didn't test this).  Anyway, I installed the app on a 4th gen iPhone Touch.  From there, just clip the sensor to your ear and plug the 30 pin connector into the iPhone/iPod Touch.  A notification pops up asking permission to use the sensor and clicking yes whisks you into the app.  The construction of the hardware is simple, yet seems effective and durable.The app itself is a cleanly designed 3rd party piece of software.  An initial mini-tour explains the very basics of convergence and heart rate variability (HRV).  Not surprisingly, all the instructions and details are digital, so you'll have to click some tabs within the app to actually find out what the principles of inner balance are and what is the point of the app.  Some things are still not explained as thoroughly as I would have preferred.  The basic idea is by learning to control your breathing, you can decrease the amount of variability between heartbeats.  If your heartbeats are more consistent, you'll have a greater capacity to lower to your stress, increase cognitive functions, and be more productive.  As a partial con, I would have liked to see some examples of ""perfect"" and ""poor"" heart rate wave traces so I knew what I was trying to aim for.A session starts by tapping the center area of the app.  A timer begins along with a visual wave reading that sort of looks like an EKG heart rate monitor.  You can swipe left and right to find your desired breathing-guide image.  The standard image is a color wheel that expands and contracts, providing a tempo for your breathing.  But there are other images, like waterfalls with a sliding metronome-type guide. You can even use your own images.  Additionally, you can further customize your breathing experience by loading a playlist or individual song.  While you're breathing and looking at the screen, the goal is to even out those heart rate waves shown on the dynamic EKG-like trace.  Chimes will also go off if you're performing well.  The more even your breathing and heart rate, the more time you'll spend in a high level of ""convergence.""  The program will also award achievement points, much like Xbox.  Once you're done with a session, just double tap the center of the screen.  The program will record your session, as well as a smiley-face mood indicator that you pick.  If you'd like, you can also journal about your experience.This is a neat product with a sensor that works amazingly well.  But how much will you get out of this product?  I think it's up to the user.  I can tell you that I used it 1-2 times a day for a week or two and didn't appreciably notice changes in stress level or cognitive function.  In general, though, I'm not a big believer of these types of stress-relieving techniques so it's no shock that the 6400 didn't do too much for me.  I haven't given up on it, though, and I plan to continue recording daily sessions for a month.  If you already practice breathing exercises and believe in their calming powers, then the Hearthmath 6400 could be a very powerful product to help you monitor and record your stress-beating levels.  If this was $30, I probably would have zero reservations about recommending this to anyone, as it would be worth a shot.  With a normal sticker price much higher than that, however, I recommend the Hearthmath 6400 inner balance sensor for people who believe in these types of breathing exercises or for people who are desperate to try anything to help them with anxiety and focus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5EA1YSGLA3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLGDKF4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5EA1YSGLA3M","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista's features and functionality for the price.The Cafe Barista is rather lightweight and has a standard sized footprint.  I'm coming from a sub $100 cheap 4-cup coffee maker/espresso combo machine and the durability and feel of this Mr. Coffee obviously blows that away.  However, I'm still impressed with how well it stacks up against the $400 and up espresso machines I see at the store.  Making an espresso, cappuccino, or latte is a straightforward process of loading your favorite espresso grounds into the included single or double shot filter, loading milk if necessary, and pushing the pre-set single or double buttons on the front of the machine.  The Mr. Coffee brews quick and can produce a consistently great froth with 1% milk (I didn't try any other types).  The milk frother's arm is adjustable and there is a cool mini-tray that you can pull out to position smaller glasses closer to the dispenser to minimize splashes.  The latter is an extremely simple, yet clever feature that I love.I have a couple cons, but they're minor.  For starters, filling the water reservoir in a shallow sink isn't always the easiest task.  The reservoir is tall, but slim.  For my shallow sink I would have loved to see a a slightly wider, but shorter reservoir.  Also, the dispenser tends to drip/leak a little after you're done brewing.  Everytime I think my beverage is totally done, I wait another minute and watch a couple extra drips fall, but there always seems to be a few more that fall out after I grab my mug.  Still, the overall clean-up isn't bad and these complaints and somewhat personalized and/or trivial.  Given the price of this unit compared to the competition, I believe it's still worth 5-stars.  Well done, Mr. Coffee...quality at-home espresso/cappucino/lattes at a price that's good for the masses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVBJQHY89VKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K9OIMU#wasThisHelpful","R3PVBJQHY89VKB","A1OZA52DFY3SHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZA52DFY3SHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This year is the first year I'm really noticing that my skin isn't as soft as smooth as it used to be.  For this reason, Ive been looking at different products to see what would help best.  I've been using this product for the past 3 weeks, and found it to improve my complexion by evening out my skin tone.  Although I was at first surprised by the bright orange carrot juice colour, I found the texture and the citrusy fragrance to be pleasant.The main ingredients of this product are :25% vitamin C20% hyaluronic acid2.5% niacinamide2.5% COQ105% Alpha Arbutin1% Wakame BiofermentVitamin C contains antioxidants, stimulates the production of collagen, and the acids act as an exfoliant. Its also used in many cultures to lighten your skin tone or even out pigmentation and discoloration.Hyaluronic Acid helps the skin retain moisture and plump up your skin by being able to attract and draw in water from the environment. This works well in more humid locations but note that in really dry climates this water binding ingredient cant draw moisture from the environment and may actually pull from deeper layers of the skinNiancinamide (or vitamin B3) works to increase ceramide and free fatty acid levels in the skin. This helps simulate microcirculation and increases water content.CoQ10 is another anti-oxidant, while Alpha Arbutin works to even out your skin tone.  Its a glucosulated hydroquinone (a product often used in skin lightening products).So this product helps to even out the skin tone, inhibit pigment formation and plumps up the skin.  I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest opinion, and I found it to help with all these effects.  I see myself continuing to use the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2NS4CVXELBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2B4TQG#wasThisHelpful","RQ2NS4CVXELBV","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The number of devices that I own has been steadily multiplying and there came a day where I was fighting for wall charger space with other members of the household.It was time to get one of these chargers.  I looked at a few different chargers and decided to order this one, mostly based on looks and the fact that it was a ""smart"" charger that figured out what power requirement each device had.The unit is fairly compact and feels solid and sturdy.  I plugged in all my ipads, iphones, kindles and android phone and they all seemed to be able to charge fine from the unit.  I'd read before from previous reviews that this product doesn't charge faster, but the fact that I can charge all the devices at once is good enough for me.  I like that this product comes with a travel pouch.  I've been taking the unit with me to the office since we also fight for one wall outlet over there too.The one thing I wish with this charger (and why it doesn't get a full 5 stars) is I wish there was some indicator light to show that the product was on / charging / fully charged.  I'm used to that with my camera charger and that would have been a nice feature.  Otherwise, the product is solid.  I received a review sample of this product for my honest opinion.

"I'd seen these mugs around but never felt compelled to buy one until my neighbour handed me a rosemary lemonade on a hot day in one of these types of mugs.  The refreshing taste was so nice I decided to go and look for my own.""These copper mugs keeps your drinks colder"" I was told.The idea just didn't make sense: copper is an excellent heat conductor. Why should it keep my drink colder?So when I received this cup, I set out to find out if the Mule cup really did keep my drinks colder.I added equal amounts of ice, vodka and ginger ale to both the copper mule cup, and just a regular old glass cup.  I started my temperature readings with a laser reader, and both were about 33 degrees.I waited let them sit for about 20 minutes, gave them a quick stir, noticed that most of the ice was gone from both cups and read their temperature again.  The glass came out at about 42 degrees, but the mule cup was about 44.  Not wanting to risk inaccuracies from the laser bouncing off ice or something, I took out a good old cooking thermometer.  The glass read at 46 degrees and the mule cup at 50.I then let them sit for a full hour, gave them a stir and took their readings again with the cooking thermometer.  The glass cup had raised to 59 degrees, and the mule cup to 61 degrees.So, the mule cup turned out to be consistently 2-4 degrees warmer than the regular old glass cup. So does it keep drinks colder?  No.THAT said, I think what is meant is that these copper mule mugs have better conductivity, meaning that you need less ice for your drink to feel cooler to the touch and to your tongue. Plus, drinking out of these mugs also IS cooler.Overall, in terms of this product specifically, the mug is extremely sturdy and comes in a nicely packaged box.  It definitely makes an excellent gift and I'm glad to have one.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my opinion.  I plan to buy a 2nd one to have a matching set for the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG97R88ILG16Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWTJEJS#wasThisHelpful","RG97R88ILG16Q","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you buy this product with the right expectations, it works great.I was looking for a waterproof case because I like to go kayaking and paddleboarding, and I never bring my phone because I worry about it getting wet.  I saw a paddleboarder with a waterproof bag similar to this one and decided to go searching for my own bag.  Then the opportunity to try a review version of this bag came up.This waterproof case claims to keep water out, fits a number of different phones, and floats.  Because I wasn't going to risk my phone, I put a piece of paper towel into the bag and submerged it under water.  For the minute I held the bag, it held fine and my paper towel stayed dry.  When I let go, the case floated.  That said, there are many reviews that talk about their phones getting wet if they leave this pouch submerged, so I wouldn't count on keeping this phone under water for any extended period of time.  For most water sports, water resistance should be more than fine.  I definitely wouldn't try to take this snorkelling or scuba diving just in case, or without testing out the particular bag by submerging it in water overnight.If you search for waterpoof case, there are a number of cases like this.  They all have a similar design, so I imagine they are all the same.  The price ranges and fluctuates, so shop around to see which product has the best price when you purchase.The one thing to note about this bag is that it is designed to fit a number of different phones. As a result, it's larger than it needs to be if your phone is an iphone, for instance.  Not a big deal, but if you don't want a clunky phone bag you might look for a pouch designed specifically for your phone type.Overall, I would use this product for my next trip out of the water, but I would still use a lot of care to keep my phone from getting wet anyway.

"I like mixing up shampoos and use everything from Aveda and Bumble and Bumble to Pantene and Fructis.  I found this shampoo to lather well and clean well.  One thing I hate about some shampoos (especially the ones that come in cheap motels) is that squeaky texture that your hair gets.  This didn't happen at all with this shampoo.  I have long hair and my hair didn't tangle, plus my hair felt nice and soft afterwards.  I still used conditioner, but my boyfriend only used the shampoo and his hair felt soft afterwards as well. The smell was pleasant (hard to identify exactly what it was, but maybe more floral).One thing I really like about this shampoo is that it has a more compact pump bottle.  A lot of the salon bottles have a much taller and narrower bottle, which doesn't fit in my shower nook nor my shower rack.  This bottle fits in the built in nook comfortably.

"When we bought our house we inherited travertine floors and the hassles that come with it.  If the floors aren't cleaned and sealed regularly a tonne of water damage happens.  I already have a sealer, but I was looking for a regular cleaner to keep the floors in tip top shape.  I'd looked at a number of different brands, but decided to try this one based on the reviews.The product comes concentrated, and you mix your own solution.  The ratio is 4 ounces per gallon, so at 32 ounces in the bottle you get 8 gallons of cleaning solution.  Compared to the other brands that are already pre-mixed, it's a great value, but it is an extra step before you can start cleaning.  It's helpful to pick up a $3 empty spray bottle at Lowes to mix the solution.  I mixed up my solution, poured it into a spray bottle and got to work scrubbing my floor with a sponge (Next time I'll just use a mop.)I found the product pretty easy to use, and had a pleasant citrusy fragrance (pleasant for a cleaning product :)  It didn't leave a high shine like Pledge does on wood, but it left my floors slightly shinier than before.  I scrubbed the floors without gloves and the product didn't wreck my skin, but it's still probably better to wear gloves with cleaning products.

"I've been seeing so many Dead Sea Mud masks as of late I was really curious to see what the benefits were.  In general, clay / mud masks are great for cleaning pores.  Dead sea mud masks have the extra benefit of being high in concentrations of magnesium, sodium, calcium and other minerals.  (Apparently most of us are deficient in magnesium and magnesium is best absorbed topically!)  It can help with some skin conditions such as eczema, acne and psoriasis.The specific ingredients in this product are : deionized water, dead sea mud, kaolin, shea butter, sunflower oil, aloe vera juice, vegetable glycerin, jojoba oil, hickory bark extract, calendula oil and xantham gum.For me, this product had a pleasant fragrance and the texture was what I expected of a mud mask.  I was able to easily apply a nice thick layer, and the mask washed off to leave my skin with a nice soft texture.  There did appear to be a bit of a film on my face after I washed it off, but it wasn't unpleasant.

It as a smoother finish than I expected for being satin nickel, but that's not a negative.  What I also liked is that the package comes with both the rounded latch plate and square latch plates so it didn't matter which type you had in your door before.  I had previously ordered a Baldwin handle set and I believe it only came in square form so I wasn't able to use it without notching out my door frame first.I bought this handle used via Amazon Warehouse.

I tried tweezing fine hairs and thicker hairs and picking up little beads and had no trouble with doing any of those tasks.I'd been purchasing Tweezerman tweezers forever, but given the fact that I'd been discovering a lot of generic brands that were as good quality as the brand names, I decided to branch out and try different tweezer brands.  In terms of heft and structure, there was no major difference between my Tweezerman and this pair (aside from stylistic where these tweezers have 3 holes where you grip).  Time will tell how sharp this stays.  The only reason this doesn't get a full 5 stars is because the lifetime guarantee is unclear.  With Tweezerman, they have a clear tweezer sharpening policy with directions for how to send back your tweezers.  I followed through with that and DID get back nicely sharpened tweezers from Tweezerman (albeit 2 months later.)  When I went on the Bodyline web site, I did not easily locate this information.  If you're not the type to send in old dull tweezers, Bodyline is a better bet for you given that it's a bit cheaper than other 'professional' quality tweezers at a comparable quality.  I received a review sample of these tweezers for my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7K5M4J7U8FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O33NJVM#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7K5M4J7U8FN","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a problem with bees in our roof.  Since a beekeeper charges you less to remove the bees (alive) if you prepare access to the beehive first ($250 vs $1-1.6K) we were highly motivated to open up the roof ourselves, but there was no way we were going to do that without protection.  After reading all the different reviews, we decided to go with this suit.  I liked that it was a full suit with elastic bands around the arms and legs.  We ordered one size larger (M instead of S for a 5'8"" person) since it sounded like it was better for the suit to be loose, and to allow clothing underneath.  We ordered gloves as well and wore long socks.  There are several different styles of bee suit out there for the head piece - I like that this one had a reinforced frame that protruded out so it wasn't as intimidating having bees buzz in your face.  I'd read that it helps to wear a baseball cap under the suit to keep the face mesh away from your face so we did that as well.  Then the suit was put to the test.  We put it on, got into the thick of the hive, and sure enough, we were well protected as hundreds of agitated bees started swarming around (and actually tried to sting us) as could be seen by all the stingers on the gloves.  Happily none of the bees got through this suit.  Glad to have gone with this suit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYDJMM7MSPG6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QECV8EA#wasThisHelpful","RYDJMM7MSPG6B","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've hated how ugly whiteboards look for years, so when we found this glass whiteboard, we immediately ordered one for the home office.Due to the size and weight (I ordered the 4x6 size), the product ships with appointment delivery.  The packaging arrived this morning completely beat up to the point that the delivery fellow suggested we open the package to make sure the contents weren't broken. Thankfully it was not.  The 4x6 size which does flex, so that can feel a bit nerve racking carrying up the stairs.As other reviewers said, it would have been nice if this whiteboard came with a mounting template since it's heavy enough to be a pain to measure directly on the wall.  We ended up using a laser level, screwed a support plank into the studs where we wanted the whiteboard to sit, and propped the whiteboard up on that to determine where the holes should go (and for drawing circles on the wall).  I recommend discarding the drywall anchors that come with it (they are the cheapest anchors ever) and getting your own sturdier ones (I used toggle lock anchors) as I wasn't confident with what came with the package.This whiteboard IS magnetic, which was a happy bonus, but because the metal backing is very thin, you may not be able to use regular magnets.  (I've attached a picture to show what the back looks like.)  The board comes with two rare earth magnets that seem to hold to the board pretty well.  It also comes with one marker which was already dry and pretty unusable.The board doesn't lie flush to the wall, but rather protrudes about a 1/2 inches out, so when you are writing in the middle the board you can see it flex a bit, but so far it's holding up ok and I think it's normal.Overall while the board does have its faults (mounting hardware especially), it's the best alternative to the standard whiteboard I've come across.  Once installed, it looks great and is worth the hassles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZXAFK1F5QMYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDSX41E#wasThisHelpful","R1ZXAFK1F5QMYV","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like a strong gum.If it's not burning it's not worth chewing.  And this is the strongest flavour I've been able to find readily short of just chewing on Altoids (and that's not gum.)I prefer this packaging format over the packs of gum that you can buy at Costco because I find these containers stay fresh better than the foil packs.  I also prefer this to the zip top bags as I don't always properly seal zip bags.

"I used to work for L'Oreal, and one of the things I learned is that if you wait long enough, the technology that is in their salon brands (such as L'Oreal Professional, Kerastase, Redken, etc.) make it to their mass market lines. :)  And being that the company was originally founded by a scientist, they actually do a decent amount of R&D on their products (857M in R&D across all brands in 2013).  I can't say I know which technologies might be in this product, but this is one of the few conditioners I can use that leaves my hair smooth and relatively frizz free (and I have coarse, thick, unruly hair.)  This product doesn't make my hair oily, but then again, I try not to apply too much conditioner near my scalp.

"I was offered a chance to try these laces, and since my boyfriend has a pair of shoes in dire need of new laces, I ordered him a pair of black laces and made him restring his shoes to try them out.Here are his impressions:I like these laces.  I used them to replace the laces on some dress shoes I didn't like, you know those really waxy ones that never hold a knot?  These replacement laces were slightly thinner than my old ones and less waxy, which means they held a knot much easier and could be double-knotted if needed without being too clunky.  I also liked that the ends of the laces where you have that half inch of hardened area wasn't extremely glossy and was very durable.  On my old black laces it practically looked like somebody had wrapped them with packaging tape, but the new ones are a nice black semi-gloss.  My only worry is that the weave on these laces isn't as tight as my old pair, and you can see some straw fibers starting to stand out (probably because they aren't overwaxed).  This isn't an issue visually, but may mean that the shoe laces won't be as long lasting.  Only time will tell on that, they might be just fine and either way I'm pleased enough that I'd buy more for my dress shoes.Note - I would recommend measuring your existing shoe laces rather than going straight off the recommendation chart.  He's a size 9 and the standard shoe lace was a way too long.In summary:+ good price for quality+ available in lots of colours+ not too waxy; can hold a knot well+ good quality wrapper around the ends of the lace (not too glossy, doesn't look like shipping tape)- weave is not as tight as some other laces. Some fraying already.*** check to make sure you have the right length","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VF3IE8HJAS7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3PBEJY#wasThisHelpful","R3VF3IE8HJAS7Z","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ordered this product because I liked their chia seeds, and I wanted to see what the difference was between this brand and Viva Labs http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HES9CMS (which is slightly cheaper).Overall, the product was not bad, but I actually prefer Viva Labs (which I received as a testing sample) better.Navitas Cacao is slightly more expensive, has a bit of a sour aftertaste, and has a pull tab resealable package that closes from the back of the pouch.  While this was fine for chia seeds, cacao powder is so fine that it just got all over my zip top and I had trouble closing it without making a mess.Also watch for the expiry date when you get it.  I ordered a two pack and found out that the cacao powder will expire within the next 4 months, so I'll be trying my best to use it up quick!Here are some of the recipes I've tried with cacao powder that have all been great so far:1. Cacao truffles.This was super simple and easy. Blend 3/4 cup of cacao powder, 10 dates, 2 tbsp of coconut oil and a sprinkling of sea salt.

"I love chocolate so much I have an entire pantry wall dedicated to couverture, cocoa, chocolate bars, truffles etc. It's probably a little ridiculous.I got interested in raw cacao because I was curious about the health benefits, and also to better understand the taste difference between raw cacao and roasted cacao beans (roasted cacao is the precursor to making chocolate.).  So when I was given the opportunity to try a sample of Viva Labs' Cacao powder and give an honest review, I said yes and decided to also order a bag of Navitas to do some comparison.WHAT IS CACAO POWDER?Cacao powder is formed by taking cacao beans, grinding them into a paste, then removing the fats by doing a cold press.  Cocoa powder on the other hand can come raw or roasted. Cocoa powder may sometimes still contain a bit of fat, and can also sometimes be mixed with sugar. Technically the FDA doesn't differentiate between cacao powder and cocoa powder so just look for the term ""raw""WHY CACAO?  WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?Cacao is considered a ""superfood"".  Superfoods are high nutrient foods that are especially beneficial.  There are over 700 nutrients and phytochemicals found in cocoa.  Among them:- High in antioxidants.  Cacao is ranked higher in antioxidants than blueberries and green teas.- High in essential minerals like magnesium, calcium, sulfur, zinc, iron, copper, potassium and manganese- Increased levels in certain neurotransmitters like serotonin and endorphins, which helps you feel good and gives you a something similar to a ""runner's high""- Good source of dietary fiber- Low in cholesterol and sodiumTo keep the benefits, you would ideally not heat your cacao above 46oC (~115oF).VIVA LABS : THE PRODUCTThe Viva Labs cacao powder has a slightly bitter, very dry flavour which I like.  In contrast, I found the Navitas cacao powder to be slightly sour tasting (which has its uses - goes better with yogurt :).  Viva Labs cacao powder melted easily into my coffee, and also blended well into my desserts.  Viva Labs cacao is made is Peru (as is Navitas).  According to many artisan chocolate makers, South American cacao is the best tasting in the world (with Venezuela & Ecuador being subjectively the very best).VIVA LABS : PACKAGINGViva Labs cacao powder comes in a big see-through zip-top bag.  It's nice because you can see how much is left and it's easy to reseal.  In contrast, I didn't like that the Navitas cacao powder had a side zip pouch.  It's prettier looking but not very practical because the cacao powder got all over the seam.VIVA LABS : PRICINGI found this brand to be one of the more affordable priced brands on Amazon. It's definitely much cheaper to order online than in stores.VIVA LABS : SHELF LIFEMy bag of cacao powder has an expiry that's 7 months out, so it should be used fairly quickly. Navitas cacao powder had an even shorter expiry of 4 months out.  Eek!VIVA LABS : CACAO EXPERIMENTS & USESGiven that most of the benefits require consuming cacao raw (< 46oC), I focused my recipes on that.1. Cacao truffles.This was super simple and easy.  Blend 3/4 cup of cacao powder, 10 dates, 2 tbsp of coconut oil and a sprinkling of sea salt.  Rolled the ""dough"" into balls and dusted with cayenne pepper & rolled in cocoa nibs.

"Picture has been fixed since this review was written.  Rest of the review applies.------As other reviewers have noted, the picture of the mounting plate is upside down.  You'll want to flip it and fold it the other way so the screws are not visible.  The towel ring came well packaged and there is a nice hefty feel to it. It's already assembled as you see in the photo, plus a mounting plate + 2 screws.I HAD to write a review because I was so impressed with Delta (or in this case Liberty Hardware).  I ordered this towel ring in the middle of a major bathroom remodel, and parts were everywhere.  So I actually managed to lose the mounting plate and screw before I had a chance to install this.  I emailed Delta to see how to order replacement parts and they redirected me to Liberty Hardware, who actually shipped me a new set of plates and screws at no charge!The only (minor) complaint is that this towel ring is very long, so my towel hangs a little lower than I'd like.  I wish they offered a shorter version.  Measure to make sure the towel ring is at a good height with towel.Overall this ring looks and feels great in the bathroom.

"Got this lock because I really liked the idea of having a occupancy indicator on the door handle itself, and well, this was the only option I could find.The install was pretty straightforward.  It installed like any normal lock and came with all the parts.  It's nice that the handle was reversible and the parts feel sturdy.  The product shipped relatively quickly.The part I didn't like as much was the actual locking mechanism.  It's the turn knob kind where I have to check that I've turned the knob all the way to make sure it actually locks the door.  A few times the door didn't actually properly lock (and of course then the sign still said vacant.)  I prefer the push button kind since there's less of a ""halfway"" mode.

"I am a scented candle junkie, so when I had the opportunity to try a sample of this product, I jumped at the chance.Id never heard of a 2 in 1 candle + moisturizer before and was intrigued by the concept.  The idea is that you can light the candle to scent your room, and afterwards use the melted wax on your skin as a moisturizer or massage oil.Unlike some of the cheaper candles that smell really artificial, this candle has a nice strong natural smell.  It does a great job of scenting up the room, even when unlit.The instructions for the moisturizer / massage part were to pour onto your palm or directly on the skin.  Ill admit I dipped the tip of my finger into the melted wax first assuming that it would be way too hot to touch but it was pleasantly warm and not too hot at all.  I dont know Id use it as a moisturizer regularly (candle is pretty hard at room temperature) but its very nice as a moisturizing oil when softened.  I have really dry skin and while it made my skin all greasy and shiny looking, it DID moisturize my dry scaly skin.  As a massage oil, it was great.The only ingredients on the candle are : natural soy wax, shea butter, jojoba oil and pure essential oils.  There is a 3-year shelf life for the candle.I didnt know a thing about the difference between soy wax and paraffin wax (the typical candle wax) so I looked it up.  Some facts:1. Soy burns safer and cleaner.  It doesnt produce as much soot as paraffin2. Soy candles burn at a lower temperature 38oC -40oC (~100-120oF) so THATs why its comfortable to apply on your skin.  Its only a little bit higher than your body temperature3. Soy is a renewable product, unlike paraffin that is derived from oil4. Soy burns slower  up to 50% longer which oftentimes offsets the higher price5. Soy is rich in Vitamin E  theres the moisturizer!  Vitamin E is also great for neutralizing free-radicals.At it's current price I would definitely buy more since its a cool date night or gift idea!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FTPJ5VZAHG52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UY1PEM4#wasThisHelpful","R2FTPJ5VZAHG52","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to like this shower.  I know someone who has the 59"" x 32"" x 97.4"" shower installed, and 5 years later it's still working great.  So I figured this should be a no brainer.Please note when they say that this shower is for right-side configuration, they mean it.  I have a 47"" nook in my bathroom and I figured it would be fine.Wrong.The shower is designed so you need to have access to the right side during installation, otherwise you cannot push the pieces together.  We were unable to mount some of the framing screws due to access and had to find other solutions to keep the frame sturdy.  Also while the pieces are beautiful, they could use some work on QA.  The pieces were too tight to fit the frame, and burrs in the cutout holes needed to be filed down to fit.  We ended up having to use a crowbar to widen the metal frame in order to slide all the shower walls in.  (We used the same installer who installed that other shower that's lasted 5 years, and he said the other shower was a breeze to put in, in comparison)When you fit the drain in, make VERY SURE that it is flowing smoothly.  We poured 5 gallons of water in as a test before mounting and that wasn't enough.  Once the shower was installed we realized the drain didn't flow quickly.  We ended up having to cut a hole in our drywall to access the drain to fix the problem.Also be sure to check all the seals in the back wall panel before you mount.  It might not hurt to add extra sealing on all the parts as we discovered that every part of the back shower leaks.  To be extra sure, we ran silicone caulking across all the edges again as well.For this shower, you will need 220v electricity.  For that, in our case we had to run a 10-3 wire to the circuit box and buy a new 30amp GFCI breaker.  That part was relatively straightforward -- except finding the breaker.  I had to go to 4 different electrical supply stores to get it.Now that the shower is installed it looks great, but it sure was a stressful install with lots of hiccups.  Let's hope it lasts as long as the other shower!Note: the instructions are very poorly translated.  I recommend finding a YouTube installation to watch the installation.  Also I got this shower on Wayfair because it's cheaper via their Premier program.UPDATE :I've had the shower for a few weeks now and have had a chance to use it more.  Overall the shower is holding up well, but the drain is a big problem.  We have to constantly monitor the drain or it backs up.  I would definitely recommend making sure the drain is functioning properly before you seal the shower in.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWKPGHDGD92X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H17RKI#wasThisHelpful","R3QWKPGHDGD92X","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just installed this fan and it looks as good as the photos.  The fan comes with a short and regular down rod, and if you need a longer rod you can purchase it separately.  The fan came very well packaged - each blade was bundled in its own protective pouch, plus the box came with white gloves for the installation so you don't smudge up your new fan.  The installation instructions weren't difficult, but they were a bit sparse.  Overall it took us about 30 minutes to install and we'd installed a few other fans before.  Once installed, the fan looks very sleek and runs super quietly.  On the highest setting you can really feel the breeze.  Only things I wish were that it had a wall-switch option, and that it had smart phone capabilities (like the Big Ass Haiku fan does).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5YJX09FPK3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIE4R8M#wasThisHelpful","R2H5YJX09FPK3Y","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of all the things I saw at CES, this was the only item I decided to buy.  I actually found their competitor, DynaFlex Powerball first but decided to go with the NSD Spinner brand instead because it sounded like they were more on top of customer service.  I also liked that they had an affordable wind up version that didn't require using the cord.  You wind it up by turning the ball in the direction of the arrow (see picture attached, the arrow is embossed into the green part.)  I'd read these kinds of balls were popular with rock climbers as a forearm exercise and it was fun to use, so I decided to give it a shotPros:- Don't have to worry about losing a cord.  You can take this thing with you anywhere and give it a spin.- Easy to use - I find myself picking this up while I'm watching TV or just walking around.- Helps with wrist / forearm pain - I have pretty bad pain from using the computer too much, and I found using the ball helped me stretch my forearms and hands and helped reduce the pain a lot- I can't validate, but when I have the ball spinning on high RPMS it takes a lot of effort to maintain my grip on the ball so I feel like I'm doing something to build up my strength.Cons:- If you have sweaty hands like I do, it's sometimes tough to wind up the ball- Very confusing lineup of options.  I recognize in the end reading and taking note of the titles is super important.  Here's an overview of the lineup -~$20 : NSD Power Essential Spinner= regular ball, no counter to show rpms, no self starter, vibration free to 15,000 RPM~$30 : NSD Power AutoStart Spinner Gyroscopic Wrist and Forearm Exerciser with Auto Start Feature= regular ball, no counter to show rpms, w/ self start, vibration free to 15,000 RPM~$40 : NSD Power Winners Roll and Spin Spinner Gyroscopic Wrist and Forearm Exerciser with Digital LCD Counter and Auto-Start Feature= ball w/ rpm meter, w/self start, vibration free to 15,000 RPM **what I got**~$50 : NSD Roll 'N Spin Rainbow Lit AutoStart Spinner Gyroscopic Wrist and Forearm Exerciser with AutoStart and Multi-Lit LED == ball no counter to show rpm, w/ self starter, has LED lights that light up to different colours depending on how fast you're spinning, vibration free to 15,000 RPM~$75 : NSD Power Winner's Precision Sterling Spinner Gyroscopic Wrist (SILVER COLOUR)= ball w/rpm meter, NO self starter.  Vibration free to 15,000 RPM.  Delivers more resistance than the plastic balls.  Inertial resistance: 19kg at 10,000rpm (350Hz) 3.2kg at 10,000rpm (450Hz) ""up to 41.3lbs""~$75: NSD Power Ultimate Winner's Precision Sterling Spinner Gyroscopic Wrist (GOLD COLOUR)= ball w/rpm meter, NO self starter.  Designed to deliver higher RPMS.  Claims vibration free operation at up to 27,000 RPM.Overall, since these aren't expensive, it was worth it for me to try out.Update: I still love this ball but I recommend not leaving it anywhere really hot.  Since I take this ball with me everywhere, I'd left it in the car overnight in the hot summer weather and I think the glue that held the grip band to the ball melted.  Now I can't keep the rubber grip on the ball when I spin as easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFJJHDTYDFMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MEWW6M#wasThisHelpful","R1TFJJHDTYDFMJ","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a recycle bin with a giant recycle symbol on the front of it so that guests would know we recycle in this house.I also wanted my recycle bin to fit under the kitchen sink.Since most kitchen sinks feature a garbage disposal situated smack in the middle of the kitchen sink, there's usually not a lot of room in the cabinets under that sink -- especially if you already have a garbage bin in there.  I'm happy to say this compact recycle bin is a great size and it fits perfectly under the sink in front of the garbage disposal, meaning I can have both my garbage bin and recycle bin side by side under the sink.  This bin is small, but I only end up needing to empty it about every other day.  Which is totally worth it that I can get everything out of sight and tucked away neatly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IN9LTJJ0GOL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PV3DRA#wasThisHelpful","R1IN9LTJJ0GOL9","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This chandelier looks just as it does in the picture -- which looks great!  And all the parts feel very sturdy.There are some things to be aware, however:- There are very few instructions, but many tiny parts.  It took close to two hours to assemble this.  The chandelier came with only one instruction sheet, which is a diagram of the sequence of parts for the ceiling anchor only- This light uses T10 bulbs with E26 bases.  If you want LEDs they come to about $12 per bulb x 6 at Lowes- Maybe obvious for some, but I'm a chandelier newb, and I didn't realize the stem HAD to attach to the ceiling.  I thought it could partly hang from the wires.  The package comes with 78"" of lead wire, however you only have 64 1/2 inches of stem.  So if you have a taller ceiling you will need to purchase additional stems.  Measure where you want the chandelier to go, then search for and add 2999NI 12"" stems or 2997NI 24"" stems as you need to get the chandelier to the right height.Overall I'm glad I have it, but wish I knew about the stems before I went and installed it to the ceiling!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKTJPXP9Y6H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014D7M8U#wasThisHelpful","RCKTJPXP9Y6H9","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 1/17/2015I had this for a year, and loved using it -- until it stopped working.  I had purchased 6 of these in total (5 as gifts), and at least 2/6 of these things no longer hold a charge.  When I emailed support, because I contacted them just over the year mark (Jan 6th purchase date), the best they could offer me was a 25% discount.  It's great when it works, but such a high failure rate within a year seems disappointing.==========================The Withings Pulse claims to track your activity, your sleep, and your heart rate.If you're looking for something that is precise and accurate for exactly what you've done, this isn't it.  I don't think the technology is quite there yet in any device.But if you're looking for something that is effective as a motivator, and that gives you a consistent baseline to measure your progress, this is perfect for that.I've been eyeing activity trackers for some time.  Many of my friends choose the Fitbit while others chose the Nike Fuel band. I finally pulled the trigger on this device specifically for a few reasons:1. Integration with a smart scale.  I think if you're really motivated to change yourself - get more active, lose some weight, you want to get the smart scale with it to close the loop.  It is that much more rewarding and encouraging to keep up with your daily goal if you see the results of your work (whether it's lower fat %, lower weight).  The Fitbit also has a scale, but I liked that the Withings scale had been around for longer.  Sure you could just get any scale and put in manual measures to your app, but I'm a lazy person and having all of that integrated and automatically synchronized is a big deal.2. Works for both iPhone and Android.  I can't find the studies right now, but it's far easier to get fit and stay healthy if everyone else is doing it too. So for group motivation and support, when I finally committed to the Withings platform, I went ALL in and got 6 trackers + the Withings scale as Christmas presents to myself and everyone around me.  The fact that it works on both mobile platforms is a big plus.  As was getting a group of us on this at the same time.  Our friendly competition has definitely pushed me on the days I felt like slacking off.3. Accurate enough.  When I've gone on hikes and walks with friends who run, we've ended up with roughly the same number +/1 100 steps (albeit different calorie counts) at the end of the trail.  So while it might not exactly match the listed distance on a trail you've gone in terms of miles, it is at least consistent enough with itself which is the most important thing.  Also, while it might log a few steps as I'm moving the pulse from the strap to my pocket and vice versa, it consistently does that so I'm going to know on any given day if I've done net more or less.4. Has motivated me.  I wasn't sure how well this thing would work, but the simple act of having a concrete measure of my activity has motivated me to move and do more than any other system I'd set up for myself before.  I periodically glance at my tracker during the day, and find myself adjusting (ok an extra-long route to the store, maybe stepping in place while I'm on the phone, pacing while I watch TV).  Knowing exactly how much I've done means there's no excuse for me to ""feel like I've done a lot"".  I know if I've been active.  Or not.5. Good customer service. I'd read online that people have had problems with their customer service.  My personal experience was far from that.  5 days after I got the tracker, my clip holder broke.  Personally I think it's poorly designed as the repeated act of taking the clip in and out of the holder every night to move put in your night armband for sleep tracking is going to add a lot of strain to the corner of the clip.  Well I emailed customer service and they offered to replace my clip for free.  I just sent them my proof of purchase and 9 days later a package arrived from France.  I can't believe they sent the replacement from France but I'm happy to have the replacement.6. Detailed app and web interface.  I haven't seen the competitor apps, but for me, the web site and the app contain all the information I need.  At a glance, I can see my overall trends (compared to the normal range), and I can see my weekly trends of when I'm sleeping, how well I'm sleeping, when I'm most active.  I tried integrating MyFitnessPal.  I couldn't stick with that kind of dedicating food logging, but if you're that kind of person, the integration gives you a complete in/out/impact picture.7. Decent battery life.  I'd say your tracker will last well over a week with regular use. And it charges back up quickly (maybe 15 minutes).  The first days I got my tracker I was religiously syncing my tracker with my phone several times a day a few days later I'd only used about a bar of battery.That said the device does have some limitations:1. The plastic clip is really fragile.  I've read reviews of people having problems with the clip falling out of the holder.  To be safe, I keep the pulse in my pocket.  At $99 (or $70 during the Christmas sale), I sure don't want to be dropping and losing this thing that often.2. Some sort of data override would be nice.  Given that the sleep tracker works by being strapped to your body, the assessment of light and deep sleep (or being awake) is measured by your amount of movement.  I can be prone to insomnia, but sometimes that involves just lying awake and feeling frustrated.  It usually doesn't involve thrashing around like a mad person because I'm so upset I'm awake.  So the tracker has mistakenly taken my lack of motion to mean I'm in blissful deep sleep.  I wish!  It'd be nice in those cases to add manual entries (the way you can with weight) to add notes.  But in generally there is a correlation where more deep sleep (or sleep overall) has resulted in feeling more rested the next day.Bottom line: The resultsHow are the results?  This was a gift to myself for Christmas.  Since then, I've used the tracker every day and have committed to doing 10,000 steps every day.  I didn't change my diet and still continued to eat a few pieces of chocolate and some kind of dessert once a day.  This is not to say I prescribe this as the best way to get healthy.  I just happen to have a healthy love of food and was also curious to see what straight up physical activity would do to my weight.  I've never been overweight and lead a relatively active lifestyle, but 8 months of living off mayonnaise laden hotdogs while living in Chile did leave me a little plumper than I cared to staySo 19 days into this I've walked an average of 73K steps every week and slept an average of close to 8 hours.  I have gone from 111 lbs to a trendline average of 108 lb (naturally my weight will fluctuate at every measure but it steadily goes down.).  I feel great and am feeling as motivated as I was on day one.  Short of accidentally washing this thing or losing it, I'm going to keep using the Pulse and keep tracking!  This device has been one of my favourite purchases in recent memory.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSWQ6FOTCOJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CW7KK9K#wasThisHelpful","R2QSWQ6FOTCOJV","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this zester / grater.  It does a great job of grating up a decent quantities of hard cheeses into nice fluffy strands.  Unlike box graters, I'm able to get just the zest off limes and lemons without getting the rind as well.  It works great with fresh or frozen ginger, but not as well with older soft soggy ginger (duh, I suppose.)  Lately, I've expanded my grating horizon to include grating chocolate shavings onto my hot cocoa.  Suffice to say I find myself using this tool a lot.  I've had this grater for a few years and it's still working well and staying sharp enough for my purposes.On the down side, if you are any kind of klutz you should probably take a bit of care when using the grater.  I have accidentally grated my knuckles more times than I'd prefer to admit.  Slow down when you get to the end of your block, or buy one of those microplane mesh protection gloves.The other issue (especially with zest) is that the zest has a tendency to get stuck inside the grating edges.  Most of the time swishing the grater around in a bowl of water does the job so it's not a big showstopper, just an extra step to cleanup.Overall this is a great tool to have in your kitchen -- just be a bit careful with it. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R428XKCPNYWYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004S7V8#wasThisHelpful","R428XKCPNYWYI","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Envelopes are not a purchase category I'd traditionally given a lot of thought to.  I knew I hated the licking type and went in search of self-seal envelopes.  Having bought these, I have now become enlightened to the fact I care a little bit more about envelopes than I'd guessed.For instance, the next time I buy envelopes I'd opt for the peel-off sticker type, and not the fold up type like these.  If you're like me and you usually write the address on the envelope first before sealing, you'll quickly realize that the fold down flap lines up right around where the TO address goes, making for some bumpy text writing.  Also, while the envelope feels nice and sturdy and they are security tinted, you can still see the contents within the envelope.  Plus this type of seal means you can peel the envelope open again.  Overall, for the price I'm fine with the envelopes for my every day purposes, but I'd still go with a different style the next time I am on the envelope shopping market again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAZ6MCKPL77J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000083E76#wasThisHelpful","RJAZ6MCKPL77J","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The online price for this product is too high!  I'd recommend printing out a 40% off coupon from Michaels or JoAnns to buy it for a better price.While this glucose is made using corn syrup, it's not the same as grocery store corn syrup in that it is much more viscous and has a lower water content.  The product itself performed the same as other glucose products I bought, but this one loses 1 star for the price, and another for the fact that the lid doesn't seal very well.

"Ever since I took a chocolate class I've been addicted to making chocolate.  And with chocolates, the addition of glucose slows down the rate of crystallization so your chocolates don't get all gritty tasting.  While a lot of glucose is made using corn syrup, it's different than the corn syrup you buy in stores in that it's much more viscous and has a lower water content.The price of this brand seemed decent when you can get it with free shipping or as an add-on item, although in a bind you can buy a smaller container of Wilton's glucose from Michaels or JoAnn's with a 40% off coupon for a comparable price.  I was able to make about 300 chocolates + 2 batches of salted caramels with this container, but will probably upgrade to a 2.2 lb tub so I don't run out so fast.

"I had the most delicious incredibly moist 72 hour short rib at Ad Hoc roughly one year ago.  At that very moment, I knew I was going to need to own a sous vide machine.  Since this was the only consumer sous vide brand available (at the time), I promptly ordered one.My impressions so far:SIZE:The unit arrived much larger than I expected.  It's roughly the size of a 1.5L coke bottle.  While this might have been really obvious to everyone it was a surprise to me. :)  The unit still fits comfortably within a stockpot for small items, but the sous vide unit will take up  of the available space of the pot.  I ended up primarily using the 12x20 plastic tub I got with my unit as the main cooking container.NOISE:Provided you have enough water it's a quiet steady hum (much like a small fish tank) that you can quickly tune out.  If the water level is too low it can be a bit noisy.ELECTRICITY USE:Given that low and slow was my plan (meaning days of cooking), I was curious to know how much electricity the unit consumed.  According the PolyScience web site, the cost of using the sous vide at 59oC (138oF) comes to about $0.03/hour.  In comparison from a study, using a gas or electric oven ranges from $0.07 - $0.10 per hour.  Good to know using it a lot doesn't break the bank :)WATER EVAPORATIONAfter an unfortunate granite-cracking incident (details below), I wasn't allowed to use the machine in the kitchen anymore, so the only possible place to use the machine was in the garage.  I was worried about water evaporation since I didn't have insulation for the container, however if you are to fill your container to the max fill line before you sleep, you can safely leave the unit overnight.  That's using a 12x20 plastic tub with no insulation and no lid.FOOD SAFETY:The most delicious medium-rare short rib is cooked at 133oF for 72 hours.  The texture you get at the end is just not replicable by any other cooking technique and these ribs alone are worth getting the machine.  However, at that temperature, my friends (aka food test subjects) were naturally curious about food safety.  The sous vide manual actually has a whole section on this.  The #1 thing to keep in mind is just to minimize the amount of time that food is kept between 5oC  (41oF) and 50oC  122oF (""the danger zone"".)  The total time that food stays in this range must not exceed 4 hours.  In general most sous vide dishes are cooked above 130oF, and above 122oF most pathogens will die off.  Just make sure your food is well chilled and goes straight from the fridge to the sous vide.  After cooking, if you aren't serving food just chill the food in an ice bath and get it in the fridge or freezer ASAP.  Also if you use the freshest ingredients possible and sear to finish off food you should be pretty well covered.THE FOOD EXPERIMENTS:1) 24 hour pork shoulder @  149oF.  Seasoned with pepper and wrapped in 2 strips of bacon.  By then, the bacon had almost entirely disintegrated leaving behind one chunk of delicious moist meat that promptly disappeared within moments of being served.  My faux ziploc bags leaked and got waterlogged so I'm looking forward to a repeat for 48 hours and with proper vacuum sealed bags.2) 1 hour poached eggs @ 145oF.  I'd never made poached eggs in my life, but all the pictures of eggs in the quick reference guide convinced me to give it a shot.  I poached them in their shells for 1 hour, and then cracked them straight onto salad for absolute deliciousness.  The only thing I'd say is you want to serve them pretty quickly because the eggs already felt a bit cold between the time we cracked the eggs and when we all sat down to eat.3) 72 hour short rib @ 133oF , 3 styles.  Here's where you absolutely need a proper vacuum sealer.  My cheapo generic brand zip bags broke within 2 hours resulting in a boiled watery mess.  Ziploc brand bags lasted the full 3 days but one of them still got waterlogged.  And after waiting 3 days for meat you don't want any hiccups!  It's painful, trust me!!  The results when everything works are where it's AT.  It's also where you can mess things up.  I did one batch plain, one with a Korean Galbi marinade and one with a red wine marinade.  Given that the sous vide is doing the tenderizing for you, you do NOT want to use marinades that tenderize.  It changes the flavor of the meat to mush and gives weird not exactly tasty results.  Likewise don't salt too much as you end up curing the meat.  If you use a marinade, try to avoid acid or alcohol (or boil it off) and make sure you allow time for your marinade to penetrate before cooking because your food will actually cook before the flavor of the marinade has time to penetrate the meat.4) 30 minute butter poached lobster at 143oF.  I got lobster tails, soaked them for 3 minutes in almost boiling water to get the shells off, chilled the lobster tails in the fridge again before combining lobster w/ butter.  Pure glutton heaven.FINISHING:Having tried blow torching and pan searing, I think I preferred the taste of pan searing better but will continue to experiment.  I used the Iwatani blowtorch.BAGS:I was so excited to use the sous vide that I didn't want to wait to buy a chamber vacuum sealer.  After using zip top bags for a week I'd say you definitely want to use a vacuum sealer if you can.  I'll be ordering a VacMaster VP112 Portable Chamber Vacuum Sealer but friends have used a FoodSaver without problems.  I'll report on using it when I do.  I know there have been some problems with the lid cracking, but at the same time upgrading to the next size means a much larger footprint.  Word of advice if you do use zip tops: NO GENERIC!  They are just too flimsy and break too easily.RANDOM COUNTERTOP INCIDENT:The first night I used the sous vide, I put it on a granite countertop.  Within hours, we discovered a crack under the counter.  According to the repair professional, granite is rated to withstand heat up to 900oF and I was cooking something at 149oF, so it shouldn't have been an issue, however I learned that granite counters often have imperfections that are filled with epoxy and this sealant CAN wear down at much lower temperatures.  While no direct cause-effect could be determined with absolute certainty, I would still say to be safe, don't put your container directly on the counter, and at least lay down a towel.  The sous vide was warm enough to actually transfer heat to the whole slab of counter.BOTTOM LINE:Since my purchase, I discovered a slew of Kickstarter sous vide machines that cost far less than this unit.  While I'm completely happy with this unit and feel like it was still worth the price I paid, were I to be on the market today I'd seriously consider a Sansaire or Anova for~$199 instead of ~$799.  Since I have what I have,  I don't regret it, and am looking forward to more sous vide action once my vacuum chamber sealer arrives!  This is definitely a must-have tool for the home kitchen!----------Update 9/4/2015 : Well I've had this machine for a few years now and it's been used continuously so I know that this machine can survive the long haul!  I even have super hard water and the poor thing has to go through getting descaled regularly.  I'm finding that my foods perform best with just a dry rub or salt and pepper.  I haven't been happy with how most of the marinades recipes have turned out as marinades seem to turn my meat to mush.  I DID buy a VacMaster VP112S to seal my bags and I much prefer it over zip loc bags.  When you buy the 250 pack bags it comes out cheaper than ziploc!  The VacMaster is quite clunky but I just keep it in the garage and it hasn't gotten in my way.  I also bought an Anova as a backup / 2nd sous vide machine but still end up using this as my main machine.About few months ago, I thought I had a calibration problem and contacted PolyScience.  I was surprised to receive a VERY detailed response from a chef at PolyScience Culinary and not just a customer service rep.  As he explained, calibration problems are very unlikely because :==========Our SVP unit features a platinum PT1000 probe that has been checked against a traceable thermometer that is calibrated against a government standard. It is possible, but highly unlikely that it's calibration is off, as every sinlge unit is tested for accuracy and stability before being air dried and packaged before leaving our facility in Niles IL.There are many great thermometers available, but they aren't as fast as the PT 1000 in the SVP. Typically, discrepancies are common and we highly DO NOT recommend offsetting the circulator based upon even a thermocouple reading. The way that the probe in the SVP works is quite different.To expand upon this topic:From Philip Preston: ""Most thermocouple type thermometers are not as fast and have inherent inaccuracies of  0.7 degrees. This and the location of their thermometer compared to the location of the probe on the SVPro can influence discrepancies between the two references.There are several factors at play here. First would be the thermal response time of differentprobes. We use a platinum (PT-1000) sensor and most kitchen thermometers use athermocouple. Thermocouples are fine and they are very fast, but they have an inherent absolute accuracy of plus or minus 2.0C. We need high accuracy and linearity. The sensor location is another factor. Even though there is circulation, our control sensor is in a close relationship to the heating element. When the heater is full on we will see a slight offset as compared to the reservoir as a whole.""From Thermoworks: Our proprietary circuit yields accuracies better than 0.7F. Thermocouples are fast but not suitable for accurate control. Even though it has been calibrated at ice point it is not linear and therefore lacks accuracy at cooking temperatures. I would never calibrate (offset) the Sous Vide Professional using a thermocouple. We test and calibrate using a Hart data logging reference thermometerhttp://www.hartscientific.com/products/1529.htmand the SVP has faster response than the reference.Recovery time is also a complex issue. In a PID control system the integrator ""I"" term must move slower than the largest anticipated thermal mass of the system being controlled. On our more accurate systems where we achieve plus or minus 0.004C stability the recovery time is very slow.

It's a comprehensive 4 in 1 book:1) The science behind chocolate, sugarwork and the various components.  Why might you want to include glucose in your chocolate and not just any sugar syrup?  What is the difference between using agar-agar, gelatin, pectin and cornstarch in making gummies and jellies?  This type of information helped me better understand why some of the steps to chocolate making mattered, and also gave me more comfort in knowing where I could deviate from recipes (e.g. I can add whatever liquid flavourings I want so long as I add them at the right time and keep my fats to liquid ratio consistent).2) Techniques - how do you temper chocolate?  how do you make aero-bar style chocolates?  what's the proper way to handle ganaches or molded chocolates?  how do you make a praline or marzipan?  what's the secret to those meltaway type chocolates?  what about the honeycomb material inside crunchie bars?3) Troubleshooting - invariably a chocolate recipe will go wrong.  how do you save a ganache that's been separated?  why did your pates de fruit sweat and what can you do about it?4) LOADS of really delicious recipes from chai tigers to a thai lemongrass truffle or toucan passionfruit chocolate to marshmallows, nougats, chocolate bars, candy crisps, caramels, fudges and more.  I made several recipes (scaled down since the recipes are for ~180 truffles each!) from the book and they have all been hits.  I have ordered more chocolate and I can't wait to try more.The book also included suggested equipment and a brief explanation of some of the tools and why they were important.The one thing missing from the book that I wish they spent time on was decorating in general -- the different techniques for finishing chocolates such as adding chocolate swirls, etc.  To be fair each recipe has a description for how to finish the chocolate such as adding bits of salt or adding candied fruit bits and they did show you how to make spiked chocolates, but I wanted to know more about selecting colours and other types of chocolate flourishes.In all it's a pricey, but valuable book that I anticipate I will be referencing a lot as I continue to learn and make chocolates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LAWTZMNTKZ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470424419#wasThisHelpful","R3LAWTZMNTKZ7K","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great value.  I got these for my iPad and Kindle Fire 8.9"", and both fit great in the bigger pouch.  I like that there's a second external pouch that I use to stuff the cables in.  In case you were curious, the smaller outside pouch actually also fits a Kindle Fire (the older smaller version).  So it's great stuff for like $7.  The only weird thing about the pouch is that on the inside, there is a mini sleeve to hold your device on one side, but the corner elastics to hold it in place are on the opposite side.  I don't know if that's a stitching defect?

"I'll admit I never used to see much value in a mouse pad.And then I bought one of those glossy Ikea tables and my mouse stopped working because the surface was too reflective.At first I went with the duct-tape-to-the-table approach, but decided eventually it was time to class things up and along with that came to the conclusion that buying a real mousepad would achieve that goal.The whole reason I didn't like most mousepads was that the raised surface just usually got in my way, and my piles of paper were already getting enough in my way.  But then I found out about mousepad skins, and eventually narrowed my search down to Razers skins and the 3M mousing surface.  What gave Razer the edge is that I already own a Razer mouse, and I figured the Razer team would design things so their own products would play nice together.  I also liked that Razer surfaces came in larger sizes.Having now my Razer Sphex mousepad-skin for a few months now, I'm really pleased with the decision.  The surface is very thin so papers don't snag, and it's a good size so that my sloppily pointed mouse still finds traction on the mousepad surface.  The edges haven't come off or frayed at all and I've repositioned the skin a couples times.  I like how my mouse feels when it glides over the slightly rough surface, and I definitely have a lot more precision with the mouse-mousepad than I expected, which is great since I do a lot of photo retouching and graphics work as a hobby.  In retrospect I might have gone for the even larger surface, but the nice thing about this size is that you can still stick it on a laptop and take it with you places.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLTA3TZKT3AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NEFQZU#wasThisHelpful","RCLTA3TZKT3AT","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned a set of ALTEC LANSING PRO SLS6221 FLAT PANEL POWERED SPEAKER SYSTEM WITH SUBWOOFER for years.  I love them - they've survived 8 moves across 2 countries and 7 years and are still going. Well worth the $300 I paid.  I have warm fuzzing feelings looking at them right now.I decided I wanted a 2nd pair of speakers, and given that my speakers are now 7 years old, supposed it was best to get a newer model, on the assumption that speaker technology had advanced some in the interim.So I ordered GOgroove BassPULSE Hi-Fidelity 2.1 Speaker Sound System with Subwoofer for PC , Mac , MP3 , iPod , Tablets and Home-Theater for $60.  They lasted about 10 minutes out of the box before they were packed back up and returned.  They sounded like $60 speakers, were a bit tinny and had flimsy cords to boot.  Note to self, speaker advancement doesn't happen like computers.After more research, I decided on the Harmon Kardon Soundsticks.  I didn't consider them at first because I thought the speakers were weird looking, but they've definitely grown on me a lot.  I like that everything is solidly constructed and the cables are thick braids in clear plastic.  I also love that the Satellite stands are adjustable so you can angle them as you see fit.And then there's sound.  They sound great!  Able to fill up a room the size of a 2 car garage nicely.  They're great value for the price and I'd definitely choose these again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TTP10DXYL8NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042F3K9W#wasThisHelpful","R1TTP10DXYL8NB","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a functional, inexpensive laptop sleeve, this one will do the job -- provided it fits.  It's cheap, I like the retractable handle, and the bottom corners of the laptop are reinforced with a slightly thicker canvas material.

I was also disappointed that the trim is a different shade of blue than pictured. (Instead of like an Azure blue, it comes across more like a Persian blue - not bad, but not what I expected from the picture).At the end of the day, I would have kept this sleeve if it was slightly bigger, but given the fit issues I'll be returning the item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6YDQNKAQKV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049O41DU#wasThisHelpful","R2W6YDQNKAQKV9","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having relied on Cooks Illustrated recommendations for many of my favourite kitchen tools, buying this book was a no brainer.  Needless to say I had high expectations going in, and this book did not disappoint.I'm an avid cook, and while I've had great success with certain types of food, I've been frustrated by inconsistent results in others.  (I can't seem to get a consistently moist pot-roast -- reason: my cooking temperature was probably too high; wrong cut of meat + oven braising is better than stovetop since it heats more evenly in more directions)The Science of Good Cooking breaks down why food cooks a certain way, and which techniques are best for what purpose.  The book is organized into 50 concepts with recipes reinforcing each concept.  There's a section called ""why this works"" following each recipe, which breaks down the science behind each step -- for instance why use a certain type of marinade, cooking technique, take extra steps, etc to achieve a desired outcome.  It's nice that it's not just a list of recipes.Experiments back each concept.  Meats were weighed, measured, smashed to determine tenderness, and moisture loss.  They came up with a range of ideal resting times for various meats based on actually measuring the amount of juices lost at various times, and they sent food to the science lab to analyze their structure.  They even stuck bones on mashed potatoes to test out whether keeping bones on makes food taste better.  This book debunked some assumptions I had (acid does not actually make food more tender), and helped me understand other ones better - why salt directly applied on skin makes it more crispy, but if you brined the skin you'd get a different outcome.  I also learned that the direction you cut your onion affects its taste - obvious in retrospect, but I never thought about that!I was disappointed I couldn't see a table of contents before purchase, so here are the 50 concepts you will find within the book -1.  Gentle Heat Prevents Overcooking2.  High Heat Develops Flavor3.  Resting Meat Maximizes Juiciness4.  Hot Food Keeps Cooking5.  Some Proteins Are Best Cooked Twice6.  Slow Heating Makes Meat Tender7.  Cook Tough Cuts Beyond Well Done8.  Tough Cuts Like a Covered Pot9.  A Covered Pot Doesn't Need Liquid10. Bones Add Flavor, Fat, and Juiciness11. Brining Maximizes Juiciness in Lean Meats12. Salt Makes Meat Juicy and Skin Crisp13. Salty Marinades work best14. Grind Meat at Home for Tender Burgers15. A Panade Keeps Ground Meat Tender16. Create Layers for a Breading That Sticks17. Good Frying is All About Oil Temperature18. Fat Makes Eggs Tender19. Gentle Heat Guarantees Smooth Custards20. Starch Keeps Eggs from Curdling21. Whipped Egg Whites Need Stabilizers22. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely23. Salting Vegetables Removes Liquid24. Green Vegetables Like it Hot -- Then Cold25. All Potatoes Are Not Created Equal26. Potato Starches Can Be Controlled27. Precooking Makes Vegetables Firmer28. Don't Soak Beans -- Brine 'Em29. Baking Soda Makes Beans and Grains Soft30. Rinsing (Not Soaking) Makes Rice Fluffy31. Slicing Changes Garlic and Onion Flavor32. Chile Heat Resides in Pith and Seeds33. Bloom Spices to Boost Their Flavor34. Not All Herbs Are for Cooking35. Glutamates, Nucleotides Add Meaty Flavor36. Emulsifiers Make Smooth Sauces37. Speed Evaporation When Cooking Wine38. More Water Makes Chewier Bread39. Rest Dough to Trim Kneading Time40. Time Builds Flavor in Bread41. Gentle Folding Stops Tough Quick Breads42. Two Leaveners Are Often Better Than One43. Layers of Butter Makes Flaky Pastry44. Vodka Makes Pie Dough Easy45. Less Protein Makes Tender Cakes, Cookies46. Creaming Butter Helps Cakes Rise47. Reverse Cream for Delicate Cakes48. Sugar Changes Texture (and Sweetness)49. Sugar and Time Makes Fruit Juicer50. Cocoa Powder Delivers Big FlavorThe only thing I would have loved was a trouble shooting / Q&A section - e.g. How do you keep meat from cooling too much when you rest it?Overall a great book if you want to improve your cooking technique, and also if you just want to learn more about why things behave the way they do!Update: Looks like ""Look inside"" is now available for this book so there's finally a table of contents! :)  Since I've been cooking with the new concepts in mind, I'm happy with how my meat dishes (especially the stews) are turning out.  I also tried using vodka instead of water to make pie crust (with the tip of putting a heated pan under the pie pan) and the pie crust turned out flaky and delicious as promised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZH2APY7YLE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933615982#wasThisHelpful","R1CZH2APY7YLE6","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The attached photo shows that this torch fits easily onto any standard size asian hotpot tank.This is my third blow torch, and thankfully, it's also the end of my search.  I've had it for 3 years now and it still works great.I first tried one of those torches that come with creme brulee kits.  Those suck.  They have weak flames, meaning it takes so long to get the job done that you'd better have 2nd dinner planned because your guests will be hungry again by the time you finish with your first pot of creme.  They are also a pain because you need to buy specialized canisters to refill the torch.I then went to the hardware store and got a soldering torch.  It was definitely far more powerful, but 1) I thought I was going to torch the whole kitchen, the flame was so large, and 2) the model I got didn't seem to handle being tipped very well and would go out.  The canisters were also way big and heavy.  I felt like I was holding a mini fire extinguisher, which knowing me I probably *should* have had on hand.Then, I found this torch.And I tell you, I'm in torching bliss.I love that it's powerful enough to brulee things quickly and evenly.  The flame is adjustable so you can have a wide, even flame or a tight targeted one.  Most of the time I just leave mine on a wide flame, which works best for creme brulee to have that even finish.  It also seared my prime rib roast nicely (I cooked my roast low and slow and wanted to finish the roast with an even crust.)  The browning of the gristle smelled so good I'm getting hungry thinking about that roast and I'm writing this review in the AM.  I've used it to finish a lot of my sous vide dishes and it's consistently worked great.The unit is compact (it comes with just the top), but it fits on top of any of the standard butane canisters you'd find at Asian grocery stores.  Just ask for the canisters for hotpot.  It means refills are cheap and relatively easy to find.  I hate the other type of blowtorch where you have to refill it into a little compartment in a handle.  Those were such a hassle.One thing is that the tip of the torch changes to a copper colour with use, which my previous torches didn't  But hey it doesn't hinder performance so who cares.  It looks well used as a result and you get more cred for being a hard core torcher.Can't wait to use this to sear the top of some pressed sushi as well.Yum!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGWGF67ECXR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027HO3XO#wasThisHelpful","R2GGWGF67ECXR9","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was interested in learning Spanish and finally took lessons.  This book was recommended by my Spanish teacher and I can see why.There are 15 short stories in total organized under:- Scary Stories- Tricksters- Strong Women- MythsThe stories start with english, followed by the spanish version.  I like that the stories are bite-sized, meaning I can read both versions in one go pretty easily.Like another reviewer said, I do wish that they put english on one side, spanish on the other so I could go back and forth a little more easily.  I found I kept flipping between the two language versions, but the stories themselves were engaging, quick, and offered good insight into spanish folklore.Overall reading the book helped with my reading comprehension, and was a good supplement to learning basic vocabulary by memorizing words.

"With the Olympics coming up again, what better thing to do than to read a pop-sci book on super-achievers written by a former Olympian?  And this former Olympian gives you insight on his journey to that level.I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Let's start with that.My biggest gripe though is, aside from learning about the author's background and his personal relevance to this subject, I didn't learn too much new.Perhaps it's because this book tends to be a bit too enthusiastic in referencing other books, and also in citing really famous experiments (Polger sisters) to showcase how what seems like raw talent is actually a whole lot of painstaking dedication to practice.  Not just any kind of practice --deliberate, smart practice that challenges your boundaries.Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is where I first learned about the 10,000 rule for excellence.  And the author clearly read the same book as it's cited a number of times.  I wish there was fresh or new insight, or more obscure studies, as I'd heard of most examples he used, BUT I still give this book 4 stars because if it's your first book on the subject, it's a really well organized and an informative journey on how superstars are built, and how you can grow and be great in something you care about  I appreciated the refreshers, and reading the book gave me the motivation to go back and improve.

"I must love Cuisinart Food Processors because this is my 3rd purchase in 10 years.  It's not that they break, I just keep giving them away to people.  I guess it's all about sharing and caring? :)I picked out this model because I wanted a sturdy, high-powered food processor that looked good on the counter.And of all the models I've owned so far, this is the best looking model.  The die-cast material is way nicer looking than the brushed stainless.But it comes with a tradeoff:  the die-cast is heavy, so don't plan on moving it around too much.  Unless you happen to need an arm workout.  And you've just blown your month's budget buying stuff like this instead of weights. (Guilty!)This unit is also tall!  The base is much taller than DLC prep, meaning the unit won't fit under my cabinet.In terms of power, I honestly don't notice a difference between it and my old model.  I don't think the cheaper models had problems chopping up products anyway.  I'm sure it IS more powerful.  That said, this model has the same limitations as others - I tried grinding down peppercorns but a spice grinder is still needed for things like that - even with the smaller bowl.Interesting for me is that the lid-locking mechanism no longer twists to lock / unlock.  It hinges on/off.  I don't know that one is better.  There is rubber lining inside the container now too -- PLUS is that it gives a better seal; MINUS in that it's a little more work to get the guck out of that.One thing I really like about this model is the container that comes with the box for holding the different blade disks and attachments.  The other model only held the attachments, so finally I have a good way to store all those components.  The box is also feels way sturdier, but it still will crack if you drop it from the counter -- which I learned.  Doh!Overall though, this is a good solid good looking workhorse.  I'm glad I have this model.  I don't see needing a replacement unless I end up giving this one away again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P35VZU57M4IJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I5DMU0#wasThisHelpful","R1P35VZU57M4IJ","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I received this book as a birthday present.The person who gave it to me rationalized that the book might be able to accomplish what he failed to do -- persuade me to get out and get running.You see, I'm don't run.  I'll hike to any destination, but run?  Forgetaboutit.Yet the book was able to convey the spirit and passion of extreme runners - ultra marathoners who run for days at a time in such a way that I didn't read about these runners' stories and think ""they're nuts"".  I started rooting for them.I enjoyed the base story - that of the author seeking answers to his running pain problem and that of the main protagonist's quest to create the ultimate race among running greats.But what I enjoyed more were the forays into our ancestral history - hypotheses for why we were made for running, nutritional facts on superfoods like chia seeds, and the history of Nike and its impact on the sport of running.I enjoyed how everything wove into a cohesive and riveting tale.  I read through the book in a day, and at the end of it, found the book both touching and thought provoking.As for getting me to run?

What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that, meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g / 1 tbsp) = 2g protein -- higher than most other grains and seeds.  Other plant sources with complete protein = quinoa, soybean, buckwheat & hempseed- good source of fibre & potassium & calcium- 3x the iron than spinach- low in cholesterol & sodium- doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen-like effects***Uses & Taste***Chia seeds taste pretty good!  Rather, there's no strong taste the way sesame does, so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry, or a thicker jelly-like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit.Ideas for use: In a salad, added to smoothies, in a breakfast granola or yogurt, in oatmeal, used as an egg replacement in baked goods, on sushi, to make iskiate (chia fresca) -- a Tarahumara energy drink, or just straight up have a spoonful.  I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great.One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth, so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :)***This brand***I haven't bought any other brand of chia seeds, but this one works so why switch?  Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag.  Bag is resealable, price on Amazon was better than in stores = a good buy.Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment - lemon chia cupcakes!  Bye bye poppy seeds!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RG7LGUMYFHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CGTN1I#wasThisHelpful","R11RG7LGUMYFHI","A1XCCS7VLCBL9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCCS7VLCBL9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having a child that is learning about cake decorating we are always looking for items that will aid her in any way possible. This silicone mold is a fun addition to any kitchen. Just recently she asked if she could make a Barbie cake so these came in handy when doing accessories on the edges. We simply placed our fondant in the mold holes and allowed it to sit for about an hour. When we pulled it off, we had perfect high heels that we then used a dab of chocolate and attached to the cake. These are just that simple! Cleanup of these silicone molds is a breeze and because of size they are super easy to store.

"Hearing so many wonderful things about utimis realistic dildo with balls I figured I had to try it, and let me say, this thing is oddly wonderful.

"My husband is a huge fan of watches and Topwells hypoallergenic wood watch is officially his favorite. This watch is absolutely exquisite. My husband washes his hands a million times a day with his position at work and this water proof watch has held up extremely well. With hand crafted wood this watch adds an eloquent touch to any outfit. One of my favorite parts about this watch is the fact that none of the links in this watch are the same, being hand crafted each piece has its own unique look to it, adding a touch of class. The face of this watch is an orange shade that accentuates the watches lovely colors.  If the watch is too big (in our case its just perfect.) removing a link seems like a very simple ordeal.

"I believe in alternatives as well as faith healing, but I have a lot of doubts about the true source of this book being God's number two man, named Compassion.Facing multiple serious health issues, I was wildly excited to get a copy of Medical Medium. I knew the publisher and author had been promoting it very heavily. Then I read it. Almost everything in the book is said to stem from a variation of the Epstein-Barr Virus (the one that causes mononucleosis).  It supposedly hides away for years, and attacks in ways unknown to medical science. Most are mystery illnesses, a lot that are difficult to diagnose and often mis-diagnosed. If you suffer from chronic fatigue, or fibromyalgia, etc, you are so sick of not being taken seriously by your Dr. And friends, that you are grateful as heck to have someone tell you your disease is real, and gives you hope that you can get better. That is what is good about this book, the dietary recommendations will certainly improve most people's health.Here is why I am deeply skeptical:1. Serious illnesses that usually carry a death sentence are not addressed at all, like cancer. Does God not want us to know the 'true' causes of cancer and heal from it? Really? None of his clients had cancer?2. To get a consultation, you must fill out a form, staring why you want a consultation. These cost $500 for a half hour, not to worry, major credit cards accepted. I.e., $1000 per HOUR.  He doesn't have time to get to everyone, so applicants are selected by 'lottery'. Or is it really that the ones who likely have the conditions in the book he claims are caused by EBV get in? The huge amount of money charged to people who are already desperate, who have already likely gone deep into debt with medical expenses and lack of work, makes me doubt that he is charging the rated God approved of.3. The online book push from Hay house was huge. You were given little chapter summaries and access to his Facebook page as gifts for pre-ordering the book. The day the book arrived in stores, you were given an offer of even better gifts, supposedly worth about $1500, if you buy another copy for a friend if you had already bought the book. I even did that for a friend with MS, before my Amazon copy arrived. The free gifts, an audio summary of the chapters, and the top 12 radio shows, which seem to track pretty exactly the content of the book. So no wonder the book is instantly on the best sellers list.4. Every cure is related to diet, mostly a vegan diet, with some supplements. Quantities of supplements are not given, 'spirit' must not know a good general average, we are told to seek the advice of a naturopath. Problem is, the conventional and alternative doctors don't know that any of this really helps, since God only made it known to Anthony it seems. The diets are likely very helpful though, since anyone with very poor health has discovered, the most healing diets in the world recommend very similar ones. You must stay on the diet sometimes for two years, I wonder how many millions more books will be sold before you decide it it worked? If it didn't work, is it because you have not eaten enough wild blueberries, or slipped back in November and had a cookie? My point is, diets of any kind are always difficult to follow, and the patient is always blamed when they do not!5. Who can question the Spirit, number two to God, who talks only to Anthony and nobody else on earth? For the Spirits information is 20-40 years ahead of medical science. By the time it is proven or disproven, Anthony and Spirit will be worth more than Bill Gates, and laughing their butts off on some nice beach.  If Spirit, who is named ""Compassion"", HAD compassion wouldn't he teach as least one person in every city how to heal, as Jesus did, immediately? And then tell people to clean up their diet? After all, Jesus taught his disciples to heal everyone who asked, and he told them to do it FREELY as their gifts were given freely. He also said that everything He did, we could do and MORE. Now I know everyone must make a living, pay for a home, a car, a staff to handle the emails, credit card charges, etc. and I don't object to that, I object to this all being very general, slow-working dietary recommendations that are available if you are a student of alternative diets, as I have been for the last several years. It makes sense of course that God should charge more per hour than anyone on earth that I know of. I am so happy God takes Visa!6. Having battled poor health for most of my life and been given the 'death sentence' of metastasized cancer, I have spent a huge amount of time and money exploring every option out there. As a result, I know that sadly, on both the conventional and alternative sides of the equation, many people out there are just trying to make money, a lot of money, on people who are desperate to feel better.7. Hearing what Anthony said on his radio show one to a caller, that wheat was not a problem, that people are not really allergic to it, because many people eat it with no problem, left me to wonder why God is so ignorant of the huge number of hybrid varieties of wheat that have been created by man. We don't eat ancient, natural wheat anymore, we eat a highly hybrid variety that bears little resemblance to the plant God created. I see though in the section on foods not to eat, that he lists gluten.The part about ADHD and Autism says that metal toxicity is the cause, but says most of this is passed on by the parents. Spirit make no mention about the toxic metals in vaccines apparently. Spirit would not want Anthony to wade into too much controversy I suppose!8. Why are there so many 5 star reviews? Because an email was sent out to everyone on his Facebook page, which he got pretty much everyone who ordered the book to sign up for, it was a free gift after all, implying that if you gave a 5 star review, you might win a grand prize that included 6 autographed copies of the book, some other things, and best of all TWO coveted free consultations. And shame on me, I was even tempted to give it 5 stars just because I would really like to hear what he said! But I suspect I already know....a version of the EBV so eat your wild blueberries and drink your celery juice!9. Why is it forbidden to record your client sessions you pay so much for? It seems like he does not want you to be able to re-hear it.Why did I give this 3 stars? Because the book does bring hope, and pretty good dietary recommendations that should improve your health. I would love to believe he is not just making this all up, and I could be wrong! I think only if you have told him nothing about your health, and he really gets all your issues accurately on a diagnostic call, could you truly believe. I am extremely spiritual, and believe very much in alternatives as well as faith healing, but I have a lot of doubts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9BKUM4ESK0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401948294#wasThisHelpful","RZ9BKUM4ESK0X","A113VSQSORQRQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A113VSQSORQRQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several books on Urban sketching, and sketchbooks in general. Most have examples of beautiful pages of the authors sketchbook, but really very little in the way of how to improve your drawing and painting skills so that you can do it too. But this book has such clear, beautifully formatted (uncluttered) examples of how to draw and paint, that it makes me feel that I can someday do beautiful sketchbooks too! The author has worked for Disney, I wonder if he took their Drawn From Life classes, because his teaching is certainly excellent. Very nice step by step examples.

"This book is a work of art, but I found it to be discouraging for me. The author says that two types of people are drawn to urban sketching; architects and fine artists. I am certainly in neither camp, but hoped for solid techniques for how anyone could begin to capture the scenes around them quickly and accurately. There are some techniques in here, but honestly each page is so packed with so many super detailed and brilliantly colored sketches that I totally missed the techniques the first pass through. I do love the book, it is a stunning example of what is possible! But for technique I like the other book I ordered at the same time much better, The Urban Sketcher by Holmes.

Mike Slaughter did a good job, but his book might have been even more powerful if he had read 'Understanding Difficult Scriptures in a Healing Way' by Matthew Linn.

"This Bible is titled 'study Bible', but there are not any study notes that explain the text,  such as the in- depth ones in the excellent HCSB Study Bible. Instead, the entire Bible is devoted to Princilpes to Live By, as written by Gene Getz. Scriptures are highlighted in rather dark blue, that Getz thinks applies to these principles. Then there are text inserts that discuss briefly the principles, and have a QR reader block to scan if you want to hear him talking about it on a you tube video.  That is the main feature of this Bible, and if you would rather listen to sermons than read, you will likely really love this Bible. I tend to prefer to read in a quiet room, but the sermons I listened to were good.There are a few maps in the very back, but the text is all in black and blue. The light blue text is not that easy to see. When a text dialog of a principle is on the page, the text continues above the box from volume A to B, instead of continuing to read A all the way down the page as you do the other pages. This is a bit confusing for the shorter dialog boxes. There are no pictures, or drawings, for example of the temple, that make the HCSB Study bible so excellent. The HCSB text is my favorite to read out of all the translations, since it translates cubits into feet, which makes it so much easier to understand. However, the large amount of deep blue highlighting detracts from the readability of the text, it would have been much nicer in a lighter shade of blue. I like to highlight my own verses, but will have to do that in a different version.The cover I ordered was green and brown, and other Bibles have basically the same cover on the front and back. This one has the nice green and brown on front, but just plain brown on back. The index version is nice, the OT books are in black and the NT books in red. The index cut outs are more of a rectangular shape than the usual round.This is an excellent Bible if you intend to use the QR scanner to listen to the lectures and want to learn the Principles. However, there are more comprehensive study Bibles if you don't plan to use the interactive features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ISSW7P8CIBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586400363#wasThisHelpful","R27ISSW7P8CIBB","A113VSQSORQRQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A113VSQSORQRQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel is astonishing, brilliant, unforgettable. The central storythe effect on Daniel and Susan Isaacson of the arrest, trial, and execution of their parents, Paul and Rochelle--- is sorrowful. However, it is not the only story. There is the story of the adult Daniel, abusive husband and 60s leftist, a man so divided and often so cruel that one cant rely on what he says, even though it is his book. There is the story of 40s radicalism as it is represented in the lives of the Isaacson parents (modeled in part on Ethel and Julius Rosenberg). The purity and innocence of their worldview is juxtaposed with the student activism of the 60s, in which Daniel participates, although with a certain detachment. There is the story of the American legal system in the grip of an anti-Communist hysteria that can make or break the careers of opportunistic prosecutors and judges and, as well of idealistic lawyers like Jake Ascher, who represents the Isaacsons, as well as Robert Lewin, who becomes a father to Daniel and Susan.And thats not the half of it. Every character, and there are many, is drawn with the finest detail: Rochelles mad mother, born in a shtetl; Selig Mindish, who betrays the Isaacsons; the black man who lives in the basement of Daniels house; the aunt who first takes the children in to her dreadful claustrophobic house, and so on. The same is true of the set pieces: the Paul Robeson concert in Peekskill, where patriots violently assault the concert-goers; the childrens flight from the childrens shelter in search of their Bronx home; Disneyland, where Daniel encounters Mindish; and, ultimately, the deaths of Paul and Rochelle in the electric chair.This is not a comfortable book. There is not a single character who is completely sympathetic. However, in its presentation of the intermingling of politics, history, and human character, it is very fine.M.

"Oh those rich blueblood WASP New Yorkers! Writers just cant take their eyes off them. Henry James couldnt, Edith Wharton couldnt, F. Scott Fitzgerald couldnt---and a good thing too. By paying meticulous attention to them, these writers wrote novels that we remember.Too bad Amor Towles did not do the same. Rules of Civility looks away a lot; it is as if Towles sensed that this ground had been covered, and covered well. As a result, his characters are as insubstantial as the smoke that drifts out of their cigarettes. Then what is he looking at, you ask, if hes bored with his stock character WASPs?Atmosphere, lots of it. (If there isnt already a screenplay in the works, Ill eat my hat.) Theres plenty of literary allusion; Katey Kontent, the (unconvincing) working class narrator talks a lot about the books she is reading; the effect is rather like little intermittent book reports to establish her intellectual bona fides. Theres thirties period detail; clothes, martini shakers, restaurant menus, cars, movie stars---to help you get the picture, of course. Unfortunately, some of this period detail isnt quite of the period, like the Appalachian Trail in Maine hiked by Kateys love interest Tinker (b. 1910) when he was a lad. Unfortunately, the AT didnt begin to take shape until the twenties and the Maine stretch wasnt completed until 1937. The book is set in 1938. The cooking detail is off, too, as in that leg of lamb roasting pan that one of the WASPS deglazes with mint jelly and cognac. Lets eat out at the 21 Club, shall we? Theres a fellow who, for unclear reasons, goes off to fight in the Spanish Civil War. When he left, I scribbled in my margin, Will get killed. Sure enough. Finally, theres lots and lots and lots of drinking and there are paper airplanes and yachts and an Adirondack lodge thats really huge and some chauffeurs and door men who seem to be much nicer than their employers.Now that last might have been a story---Depression-era help dishing on the swells (albeit in an imitation of the method of The Help). To her credit, Katey Kontent, in her magazine editorial assistant phase, sets out to get it. We hear about the droves of men who answer her ad and show up eager to tell all, but that plot line disappears into the general dashing about and tying of loose ends at the end.I love period movies. Soon a good screenwriter will take this novel in hand, stripping away the tiresome dialogue, ditching the paper airplanes and the literary allusions, zeroing in on the Evelyn-Tinker-Katey triangle, likely with more explicit sex. The movie will have fabulous sets and even more martinis and, if its good, will make clear that this story is set in, yes, the Depression. That is something that the novel, in its fascination with all things upper class, keeps forgetting.M.

"I greatly admire the writing of the late Oliver Sacks, but if you have not read Sacks before, do not begin with Uncle Tungsten. It is not Sackss best work. His forte is the essay, not the book-length memoir. There is no more moving example of this than his last published essay on, of all things, gefilte fish, published in The New Yorker just a short time before he died.Uncle Tungsten is an uneasy hybrid of memoir and science history. As a boy, Sacks fell in love, in a most precocious way, with chemistry. He was encouraged in this by several family members in a most remarkable family, chief among them his Uncle Dave, the Uncle Tungsten (he owned a light bulb factory) of the title. The family recollections are the most appealing part of the book, but they constitute only about a third of its length. The rest is filled with little accounts of the achievements of the great 19th century men of science, men like Humphrey Davy, John Dalton, Joseph Priestley, and others. As the literary glue between the science parts and the family parts, Sack supplies an account of his discovery of these scientists and his own attempts to replicate their discoveries in his home laboratory. This doesnt work very well, since the writing in the science parts is workmanlike and often simply not very interesting. One begins to think filler, as if some editor had suggested Sacks write a memoir and it turned out that the personal parts didnt quite add up to a book.Oddly, the science parts also lack attribution, although the information must have come from somewhere. There is not even a bibliography.So stick to the essays, whether in the collections, like "" The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, or in periodicals or even the newspaper. Sacks wrote several compelling short pieces for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times about the last year of his life, when he knew he was dying of cancer. This is the sort of writing this gifted man did best.M.

"Purity is big and sprawling, like a Dickens novel. It has plenty of unlikeable characters, like a Dickens novel. It is full of acid observations about the way we live now, like a Dickens novel. And all of the subplots, digressions, and various entanglements come together at the end, with a measure of happiness, just like a Dickens novel. If we lived in different times, it even might lend itself to being published in serial form, as Dickens novels were. (The Andreas Wolf section did appear in The New Yorker this summer.) And of course one of the main characters is a woman named Pip, who turns out to have some Great Expectations.Of course, Purity has some things a Dickens novel does not: some explicit sex; a plot that moves all over the place, from San Francisco to East Berlin to Bolivia and Denver, with stops in Texas, Philly, and New York; big shifts in time, from postwar Berlin to now, when self-designated transparency experts yank back the curtain on murky government doings by dumping data on the Internet. So, unlike a Dickens novel, Purity moves in great swoops of time and place and sometimes its hard to keep it all straight AND catch those sly jokes on the literary establishment, German slang, and etc.  You have to pay attention.Its worth it. (And whoever said that you have to like characters in order to enjoy a book?) Purity is a novel about tyranny and absolutism, about the power of governments and corporations (think Google) and experts (the Sunlight data dumper Andreas Wolf) and even parents who think that they best suited to telling us what is good for us. It is also about secrets and about the difficulties of discovering what is true, whether that is the reality of capitalist prosperity, if you live in communist East Berlin, or the identity of your father, if you are Pip, who keeps on looking when most people would give up. Most people do give up when confronted with a monolithic government or corporation---thats the bleak strain running through the novel.The novel starts slowly (with the unlikable Pip) and its worth a bit of patience until you are 100 pages or so in and the intertwining stories start making you keep the light on at night. If you dont like thinking about this stuff, you can always pick up your device and start texting.M.

"This very interesting account of three Japanese women sent to the United States as children in 1871 in order to acquire a ""Western"" education makes for compelling reading for at least the first half of the book. Nimura does a competent job in describing the opening of Japan, the Meiji restoration, and the loss of samurai status faced by the families of these girls. In the ten years of their sojourn in the U.S., each girl emerges as a distinctive personality, perhaps because there seems to be a variety of English language sources to draw upon to depict them. Their return to Japan as young women is also quite interesting, since there seems to be quite a bit of information about their difficulties with the Japanese language and with re-acquainting themselves with the culture.After that, the focus of the book is more blurred, since each woman follows a different path; one marries into the highest echelon of Japanese society; one teaches music and focuses on her family; and the youngest remains unmarried and devoted to the education of Japanese women. Nimura tries hard to convey the difficulties and compromises of their lives as adult women, but often the detail that is available to her (I don't know if she was able to use Japanese language sources) is either dry (details of balls and luncheons) or reticent (personal letters). I suppose it sounds odd to say this about a work of history, but one wonders what a novelist, less constrained by absolute fidelity to the historical record, might have made of this story.M.

When they are captured by pirates, one feels sympathy for them, but not for long.While they are, in some sense, innocent in terms of their ages and life experience, they harbor emotions and impulses that are the same as those of adults, only more secret and unrecognized---and just as devastating and even murderous.At the center of the novel is the consciousness of Emily, the second oldest Bas-Thornton children, and the only one who, in the course of the novel, matures into a semi-awareness of herself as a separate human being. At times she is a child, turning somersaults, at other times she carries on a creepy flirtation with the pirate captain (although she does not really understand flirtation), and eventually she comes to hold his life, rather casually, in her hands (although she does not really understand her power).These children, and they are meant to stand for all children, have only the most rudimentary understanding of ethics and possess absolutely unreliable memories. One cannot rely on them for anything, as more than one confounded adult discovers. It is fitting that Emilys father, unsuccessful in Jamaica, becomes a drama critic upon his return to London. The illusory lives he sees on the stage are, ironically, more real to him than the lives of his children.I dont quite see the connection to Lord of the Flies. One book that does resemble it in terms of an interest in the consciousness of children is Elizabeth Bowens The House In Paris. Both novels leave a reader feeling very unsettled.M.

"Kindred sets up a kind of back-to-the-future scenario in which Dana, an African-American woman circa 1976, is repeatedly drawn backward in time to an antebellum plantation in Maryland. Here, the relationship between a slave and her owner sets up the line of kinship that will lead to Danas own birth. Its an interesting premise for an alternative history, but it doesnt really work.The biggest problem is the novels didactic tone. We must believe that Dana knows little about the lives of slaves in this period, so Butler is often forced to digress from the plot to teach Dana about life in this period. Trouble is, theres far more powerful (and firsthand)  testimony about this by a man whose Narrative, published in 1845, spared no words to depict the harshness of slavery----that is, Frederick Douglass, himself a slave on a Maryland plantation. On top of this, it seems inconceivable that Dana, an aspiring writer, would be so ignorant of African-American history.The novel struck me as most suitable for a high school reader, probably because of that same didacticism. Some secondary students will encounter Toni Morrisons Beloved, but for many younger readers, it is too demanding. Kindred is not difficult and would make an interesting pairing with Douglasss Narrative.It also would, in the right hands, make a very interesting movie.M.

"This memoir is a very slight one. It reads like a rummage through boxes stored away. Or, to use another image, it's like a scrapbook of images, some of them very sentimental, put together for the family. (Maxine Kumin died last year.) She's a better writer than this memoir indicates. Although I am not a particular fan of her poetry, I've always admired the woman who left the city behind to move to an old farm in New Hampshire, and I've always admired her eye for the details of country life. She became an accomplished mushroom hunter, an avid horsewoman, the kind of gardener who hid the last of tomatoes under old bedsheets to keep the frost away. Better to look into another book of hers, the collection of essays entitled ""In Deep: Country Essays"". It's a better book and a better memorial for a sharp-eyed writer who relished her adopted New England (see the essay ""A Sense of Place""). Hers was a hillside farm, neither in the rich bottom land the farmers coveted  nor on the heights where the rich folks built for the view. She rather liked being in the middle.M.

"James Rebanks, a man descended from Lake District sheep farmers, a man who went from alienated high school dropout to Oxford graduate, has an inspiring life story. His devotion to raising sheep, a demanding profession, is evident, and the detail of his shepherds life are compelling---at first.As the book develops, its flaws become irritating and then maddening. The entire book is written in the first person. It drifts aimlessly from past to present, from the life of his grandfather to a sheep sale, from his tense relationship with his father to a difficult lambing. Inevitably, it becomes repetitious and often dull. The writing is often banal. One particular subject of his ire (teachers are another) is the poet Wordsworth, for whose poetry and life in the Lake District Rebanks has scant understanding. He appears to view him as some kind of invading literary tourist. (He also dislikes regular non-poet tourists, at least when they appear in his part of the world.)Its too bad an editor couldnt have helped to shape this story, cutting out the fat and repetitions, lending narrative coherence, getting rid of the wretched you are there present tense.

"Virgin Territory is Nancy Harmon Jenkinss comprehensive, and often passionate, guide to the world of extra virgin olive oil. The first third of the book is informational, covering the history of olive cultivation, the mechanics of oil extraction, the differences between types of oil, misconceptions about tasting and storing oil, and the health benefits of olive oil. You will learn how to properly taste olive oil and how to distinguish well-made oil from rancid or fusty oil. I learned a lot about how to seek out good quality olive oil. There is a helpful appendix that lists suppliers and online sources.The rest of the book is devoted to recipes using extra virgin oil. I found that the most compelling were the simplest---that is, those in which the taste of good quality oil is ascendant. The recipe for marinated green olives is worth the price of the book. More complicated and highly seasoned recipesone for curry, for examplewell, I couldnt see the point of using olive oil, even a less expensive one, in these. And fried chicken? Really? My Yankee thriftiness balked.One aspect of this book, which is absolutely devoted to helping a consumer appreciate honest, well-crafted oils, struck me as rather dishonest. The oils of many countries are mentioned, including those of Palestine, one of whose producers merits a two-page cameo. Nowhere are the olive oils of Israel mentioned, except those of biblical times. Is olive oil no longer produced in Israel?  Or, if it is, is it of such poor quality as to not be worth a mention? Should a consumer be warned against it?  Of course not. In this book, which aims to be THE last word on olive oil, Israeli producers appear to be the subject of a literary boycott. I say appear, because Ms. Jenkins confines herself to a few highly critical observations about difficulties the Israeli army creates for some Palestinian producers. Nowhere does she forthrightly state what becomes evident, which is that her political views have led her to exclude any mention of Israeli olive oil in her book. Perhaps she felt that these views would affect the sale of her book. However, in politics, as in the world of olive oil, honesty is always the best policy.M.

"I encountered an excerpt of this semi-autographical novel  in The New Yorker, and I recall then being very moved by the story of an Indian immigrant family whose promising eldest son, Birju, is grievously injured when he strikes his head after diving into a swimming pool. The narrator, the younger son, Ajay, relates the effect of the accident on himself, on his father, who becomes an alcoholic, and on his mother, who neglects her younger son in her all-consuming care for Birju. Ajay's voice is bruised, flat. He often does not know how he should react or what he should say to others. He tries on different versions of himself: the helpful son, the rebellious son, the boastful middle schooler, the romantic teen, the secret artist. None of these seem to quite fit.However the center of the novel, at least for me, is Birju, brain-injured and blind, lying in the middle of the house in his hospital bed. This is one of the most honest and detailed depictions of this sort of injury that a reader is likely to encounter. A story like this does not have a happy ending. Caring for Birju is not uplifting and transforming. It does not make anyone in his family a ""better person."" Most people like to think that ""something"" can be done, and in the Indian community of the novel, it means that the family must submit to a series of people who pray or otherwise claim they can produce a miracle. There are also those who prey, peddling insurance policies and the like, or seeking some sort of spiritual understanding--for themselves.""Family Life"" is a novel based on real circumstances, but it reads like a memoir.

"The inhabitants of the barges moored to a shore of the Thames live in walking distance of 1960's London but also distant from it. Mail delivery is unpredictable, telephones scarce, authority figures few. One boat is shipshape, but the rest are in varying stages of decay; one functions as a receptacle for stolen goods, another sinks. However, the inhabitants, utterly diverse, function as a tiny community, and the two children in the novel, Martha and Tilda, along with a wonderful cat named Stripey, move fluidly back and forth among the boats, which are not only at anchor (kind of) in the Thames, but tied, in physical and human ways, to each other.If you require  a tidy novel that gathers up its characters and deposits them in a satisfying ending, you won't like Offshore. If you'd like to live for a few hours in a microcosm of humanity that's full of humor, pathos, and the oddest sort of happenstance, then you'll enjoy it. Penelope Fitzgerald herself lived for a time on a Thames barge and perhaps there is a bit of her in Nenna, the mother of the two children and a woman whose marriage is unraveling. It is Nenna who most appreciates that ""sagacious brute"" of a cat Stripey, who dashes to and fro most days but, when she needs to, knows how to find a warm hold.M.

"I picked up this novel from the booksellers remainder table. I should have left it there. It is terrible.This historical novel is anything but. It is as if the author did some rudimentary research into nineteenth century science and history, then tossed it in whenever a bit of authentic color was needed. There is simply no sense of what it was like to live in the Philadelphia in this period. Some of the historical background  (and thats what it is---background) is little better than information in a Wikipedia entry. Compared to writers of historical fiction like A.S. Byatt or Hilary Mantel----well, there simply is no comparison.The big theme of the novelintelligent but ugly woman turns to botanizing because no man will have heris absurd. Perhaps this is because Gilbert reminds the reader at every turn that her protagonist, Alma Whittaker, is REALLY ugly. She even gives her a gorgeous adopted sister to underscore the point. And thats it: Alma is depicted either a brilliant woman who can hold her own with the men in intellectual conversation or as an emotionally starved woman. As a character, she is like a cartoon; there is no depth or complexity to her at all.Then, there is the authors supremely irritating tone. She has no confidence at all that readers might understand life in a different era, so she constantly nudges in irritating asides. Get it? she seems to say. We know how they were back then (wink wink). Since she cant bring us into the period on the strength of her writing, she must tell us about it.And finally, this novel, implausible, pretentious, and oh so cloying, is a bore.

"My Brilliant Friend, by the writer whose nom de plume is Elena Ferrante, is set in 1950's Naples, a time when Fascism and the war are not so long ago. What's interesting about the friendship between Elena Greco and her friend, Lila Cerullo, both of them the children of impoverished families, is how similar circumstances send these two bright girls in completely different directions. Both families have little use for education (for girls) and place a high value on marriage and economic security. Both families are caught up in the old, violent, and seemingly unending feuds that define the neighborhood.Yet as Elena begins to push past the boundaries of the neighborhood, entering high school and tentatively finding her voice as a writer, Lila, arguably the more ""brilliant"" of the two, falls back. At the beginning of the novel, Elena seems to live in the shadow of Lila, and even when she enters middle school and Lila does not, she feels behind, since Lila takes books out of the library to stay even with Elena. Eventually Elena pulls ahead and, at a wedding, her mother, having finally taken notice of her daughter's accomplishments, literally holds onto the hem of her dress to keep Elena from dancing with a boy who will never be more than a mechanic.Since this novel is the first in a trilogy, a reader can't know for sure which friend is the ""brilliant"" one. Their old teacher is certain that it is Lila, but Lila herself calls Elena the brilliant one. And of what does this brilliance consist: escaping from poverty and the chronic angers of a ""pleb"" household to a home with a phone, a bath, and a car? Or defying the immutable expectation of parents that their daughters, with only a basic education, will marry as teens and begin to have children? Escape takes more than one form in this novel.M.

"The Greenlanders is a tour de force, utterly enjoyable from start to finish. I knew Jane Smileys work from A Thousand Acres, the book that won her the Pulitzer, and while I admired that book, I also found (on a second reading) its connection to King Lear to be a bit contrived.  The Greenlanders will bring to mind that other saga of medieval Scandinavian life, Sigrid Undsets trilogy Kristin Lavransdatter, but to my mind The Greenlanders is the better book.Whats remarkable is the way that Smiley depicts the precarious nature of life in 14th century Greenland. There is simply no predicting what will happen next. Although the novel follows the fortunes of one particular family, it does not focus on them; different family members move in and out of focus as their lives intertwine with others: lovers, enemies, skraelings (native) people), worldly visitors from the Norwegian homeland. Characters suddenly appear, and, just as suddenly, disappear. Death takes them; skraelings kill or abduct them; murderous feuds erupt into terrible violence; madness, famine, and wasting diseases grip the living.However, the book is not just about the fragility of life in a community that is in decline from its best and most prosperous days. It is also about the beauty to be found in a bleak landscape inhabited by a Christian people who wait patiently for the bishop from Norway who never comes. These people measure their wealth in sheep pastured, seals and reindeer hunted, cheeses stacked in the storehouse. So rich and varied are their lives that, even in the famine years, they never seem poor. Dont miss this book.M.

"Carolyn Chutes new novel, the second in a projected series, follows The School on Hearts Content Road in its depiction of the Settlement, a utopian agrarian community in the lake and hill country of western Maine. Set in the late 1990s, this novel centers once more on the Settlements charismatic founder, Gordon St. Onge, but it is full of characters, as many as a Russian novel. (There is a helpful list of them all in the back of the book.)Actually, there are four utopian visions in the novel: the communal one of the Settlement, opposed to materialism and corporate greed; the conspiracy-minded one of a local militia group, obsessed with racial purity and the Second Amendment; and the anarchist one of a group that calls itself the Anti-Rich Society. The fourth and newest one, led Bree Vandermast, a Settlement teenager who challenges Gordons leadership, calls itself the True Maine Militia and winds together elements of the first three as the young people of the Settlement seek to find their way into the future.The title of the novel, Treat Us Like Dogs and We Will Become Wolves speaks for itself. Chutes subject has always been the poor and dispossessed, but in this novel the social and economic pressures on Egypt, Maine, have become unbearable. The outside world pushes in; it is not enough any more to smash televisions to keep it away. The press writes sensational articles; FBI agents snoop around; DHS social workers inquire. Divisions also arise within the Settlement: should it attach to the Internet? should it allow in a friendly reporter? should it keep its distance from the armed militia led by Gordons old friend Rex York?However, the great power of this novel lies in the way Chute writes about people who dont get written about much. It is here that you will find pitch perfect renderings of Maine French Canadian patois and rural Maine vernacular. Sometimes the novel wanders off to describe in loving detail a childs homemade jumper;  a rack of loaded canning jars, so seedy and tomatoey, a winter comfort; a Maine blue sky; a falling-down mobile home. Each character, no matter how minor is rendered as an individual, clothes, quirks, speech patterns, and all, as if in refutation of the view Gordon articulates of the outside world: There izzz only democracy among lords and ladies and the top. The rest of us are just yard fowl.Other novels set in Maine, novels like Strouts Olive Kitteridge or Russos Empire Falls, go down a lot easier than Treat Us Like Wolves. It is hard to imagine it being turned into an HBO mini-series. It is a long book that, like a novel by Faulkner, another chronicler of the dispossessed, demands your time and your attention. Throughout the novel, a blaring cartoon television-character characterizes Chutes people asthe scrungy bad people in the cities and towns across America! They can hurt us! They blow up buildings, they rob, they shoot, they let their children roam and never read to them, they collect welfare, they rape, they piss in front of people and cut people up, they smell and have sores and tattoos and nose rings and nipple rings and swastikas and they never wear pastels. They are dripping in drugs and explosives and have no teeth. They want to hurt us! They are filled with envy and madness. They make our taxes soar.  A lot of them are illegal immigrants. Some are not. Whatever, they are COSTING.In Treat Us Like Wolves, Carolyn Chute , astute, sympathetic, and more humorous than the cartoon TV could ever be, answers back.M.

Kyocera, a Japanese company well known for its ceramic knives, has put out a line of moderately-priced ceramic lined cookware that offers good non-stick properties. (The pans are made in Vietnam.) Eggs and crepes release effortlessly. Clean-up is easy, too.

The pan has a nice feel, especially the stainless steel handle, which stays cool.

"Atul Gawande, a surgeon who also specializes in writing about medical issues for The New Yorker, is a talentedl writer. In his book Being Mortal, he draws on his experiences as a physician to examine the generally dreadful choices that people must make as they face death. In a particular moving essay, he describes the ordeal of his own father. The elder Gawande, a physician himself, endures physical and emotional suffering, debilitating medical procedures, and profound changes in the way he lives his life before the end comes. Other essays deal with cultural shifts in the way American society cares for its elderly: the rise of the nursing home, the development of the assisted living concept, the spread of hospice care, the shift away from and, now, back to deaths at home. However the focus of the book is Gawande's ideas about how to empower dying people to take control of their lives in the time they have left.It is hard to disagree with any of Gawande's observations. One could wish that every person in America who deals with the elderly---doctors, in particular---would read the book. Gawande himself strove to learn from others about how to talk to patients with terminal illnesses and how to actually listen to their desires. This is also a useful book for anyone with a parent or family member at the end of life. Perhaps some teenager will even pick it up and decide to enter that humble specialty, geriatrics, a medical specialty not nearly as lucrative as most others. One hopes it falls into the hands of every nursing home administrator in the country.But ........There is one topic that appears hardly at all in Being Mortal. That topic is money. Certainly Gawande decries the uselessness of the medical procedures that simply prolong suffering. However, he seems to suggest that things might improve if only patients were better informed, if only they had more help in making choices that enhanced rather than degraded the quality of their last days.  A recent article offers a harsher perspective.This is a stunning piece (""Fighting to Honor a Father's Last Wish: To Die At Home,"" 9/25/2014) in the New York Times by the investigative reporter Nina Bernstein.  It details a woman's battle to bring her frail elderly father home to die. Her attempt is mostly a failure, as in the last year of his life her father is shifted among hospitals, nursing homes, ""rehabilitation"" centers,"" poor quality home care, and various iterations of hospice. The cost? More than one million dollars. All of these so-called ""providers"" are chasing Medicaid and Medicare money; none of them offers even close to the ideal of care that Gawande talks about and (in a few instances) finds. As a gerontologist quoted in the Bernstein article says, ""We have these frail older people moving about in the medical-industrial complex that we've constructed. It's all about profit margins. It's not about caring for people."" (You can find the article at http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/nyregion/family-fights-health-care-system-for-simple-request-to-die-at-home.html)From within that very medical-industrial complex, Gawande's Being Mortal sounds a graceful warning. However,  it's rather like tapping your glass for attention when the Times article suggests that what's needed is a fire alarm.M.

"""Local Souls"" consists of three novellas set in the imaginary small town of Falls, North Carolina. As a reader who greatly enjoyed Gurganus's novel ""Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All,"" I looked forward to this new book. There is much to enjoy. The three different narrators of these stories (a writer, a mother with an insufferable daughter, a man whose life intertwines with that of a revered doctor) speak in language that can veer from bleak to comic in an instant. Gurganus's feel for the perfect (often funny) simile, for the details of setting, for the fine points of social class differences, for the abiding strangeness of human behavior, is as good as I remembered it from ""Confederate Widow.""However, the stories are uneven. ""Fear Not,"" about the consequences of a terrible accident, is melodramatic without being very convincing. ""Decoy,"" the longest of the three, is so talky that it eventually becomes tiresome. I liked ""Saints Have Mothers,"" told in the voice of an embittered middle-aged woman, the best, even though the details of the accident in this story (all three novellas contain a drowning of one sort or another) are close to improbable.What's odd about these three stories is that although the speakers are of different genders, ages, and backgrounds, they sound much the same, as if they all shared the same outlook in life: self-mocking, sometimes witty, sometimes despairing. Perhaps I would have liked them better had I not read them one after the other, but that's the way they're packaged.M.

"Finally. I've lived in Maine for decades, but until I now had never read a book by Stephen King. Can you believe that I didn't even know a single thing about the plot? I must say that I enjoyed it in the way that I enjoy watching a cop show on TV: you can tell where it's headed pretty quickly, but the trip is terrifying anyway.

"""Tracker"" is bound to be a disappointment to those who admire Gary Paulsen's best fiction, like ""Hatchet."" The idea at the heart of the novel is complex: can the adolescent John Borne  somehow deflect his grandfather's death by an almost surreal pursuit of a doe he sets out to hunt for meat? This is a tale that might make a short story, but ""Tracker"" feels padded out by long, repetitious stretches of descriptive prose. A better choice is John Gardner's ""Stone Fox,"" another story about a grandfather laid low by illness and a boy who must manage on his own. In both books, there is a kind of magical thinking about death, but ""Stone Fox"" is not only a better read, but a more approachable ""take"" on adolescents struggling with the idea of the mortality of people they love.M.

"The Testament of Mary is really two stories about storytelling. On the one hand, it is the story of Mary herself as she approaches the end of her life and reflects, with regret, on her role in her sons adult life and his crucifixion. Before the crucifixion, she was a peasant woman who drew strength from her husband, her son, and her religious faith. After the crucifixion, she experiences only fear and unhappiness as she replays the events over and over in her mind, thinking about what she might have said or done differently.On the other hand, The Testament is also a story about how stories are made---that is, the story of Jesus life and death being created by his disciples. As Mary says of them, they want a simple, pleasing narrative, one stripped of complexity and doubt, one that will uplift and inspire. Marys very existence as a doubter of her sons divinity is a challenge to this kind of story making, and the men who are in charge of the story keep watch on Mary, lest she spoil it.For herself, Mary has built a kind of psychological jail, a testament that may be far harsher than it needs to be. As she says herself, the death of her son unhinged her. She narrates her testament inside a second jail, since her minders keep her close in a kind of home detention in Ephesus, far from the places where Jesus grew up, taught, and was buried.None of these narrators is reliable, neither the woman berating herself nor the careful mythmakers of the new religion.  Mary, as a powerless and nearly voiceless woman, is drawn finally to the old gods, particularly Artemis, who seems to her a figure of comfort. She cannot foresee that this is precisely the role that she will acquire, long after she is dust, in ascendant Christianity.M.

"""Dissident Gardens"" tells the stories of three generations of American radicals: Rose Angrush, a Communist of the thirties; her daughter Miriam, a sixties activist; and Rose's grandson Sergius, who falls in with the Occupy movement. Even though Miriam, as a teenager, furiously rebels against her mother Rose, who in retaliation once pushes her daughter's head in the gas oven, the two are joined by a common desire to upset the prevailing order.These two women are surrounded by a cast of ""fellow travelers,"" some of them, like Tommy Gogan, Miriam's folksinger husband, and Cicero Lookins, the obese professor who's the child of Rose's African-American lover, quite wonderfully depicted. There are some great set pieces, as well, as when Rose is read out of the Party while serving cookies to her fellow communists in her own kitchen. Food is at the center of another wonderful scene, when Cicero visits the senile Rose in the Lewis Howard Latimer Care Facility.All in all, however, the novel does not really hang together. For one thing, there are too many minor characters, like the distasteful cousin Lenny, to whom pages and pages are devoted---to no particular end except to slow down the novel's pace. And even though the novel centers on Rose's home, Sunnyside Gardens in Queens, the story ranges all over the place: a Bowdoin-type Maine college, a Greenwich village commune, a Pennsylvania Quaker boarding school, Nicaragua. By the end, I found myself reading (okay, skimming) past paragraph after paragraph of period detail and philosophical digressions. It's as if Lethem could not bear to leave anything out.Rose Zimmer Angrush is the best character in the book.

"First: a commercial. If you haven't read Rachel Kushner's first novel, ""Telex From Cuba,"" stop reading this and go get that book.If you have read ""Telex,"" you might be wondering if ""The Flamethrowers"" is as good. It isn't.However, Kushner is a gifted and interesting writer, and there are pleasures to be had in her second novel.The flamethrowers were World War I soldiers who carried great canisters of gas, the better to hurl fire into enemy trenches. This novel is about two different sorts of flamethrowers: avant garde artists who attack old ways of thinking about visual art and political radicals who attack existing political and economic ideas and institutions. Their worlds intersect in the 1970's, in New York (the art scene, political unrest, the Great Blackout) and Italy (the Red Brigades, political oligarchies, unreconstructed Fascists).They also intersect in the person of a young woman from Reno (she has no other name) who has come to New York to make it as an artist. Reno is nave and vulnerable, but she has a camera, and she focuses it on everything. Everything.Thus there are wonderful set pieces, like the looting after the blackouts or the street demonstrations in Rome, like the preening dinner table conversationalists of the New York art scene, like Reno's trip to the Bonneville Salt Flats, where she becomes the world's fastest woman (on a motorcycle). However, what Reno is thinking and feeling often ends up being rather uninteresting, perhaps because there isn't much to her. She is always looking ahead to what she might become. In addition, the research that went into the recreation of this era often feels like---research.So grab ""Telex,"" if you've read this far and didn't immediately take my advice. That way, you'll know to keep an eye out for whatever Kushner writes next.M.

"The best way to describe ""The Dream of Scipio"" is to call it an historical novel with a philosophical bent. In the beginning, the three intertwined stories, set in Provence during the 5th, 14th, and 20th centuries, move rather slowly. Pears has set himself the task of sketching three historical periods when the world seems to be coming undone---the twilight of the Roman Empire, the period of the papal schism and the black death, the Nazi occupation of France. The necessity of establishing each of these historical settings before the novel ever even gets going almost derails it.However, a patient reader will be rewarded as the pace picks up. What interests Pears is not the disintegration of established societies, but the tension between political figures with the power to ""save"" civilization and relatively powerless characters whose actions (although they may have far reaching consequences) are focused on personal relationships.Thus Manlius, the wealthy Roman turned Christian bishop, attempts to buy a bit more time for the world he knows by cutting a deal with encroaching ""barbarians."" The consequences of this action reverberate in the life of the poet Olivier de Noyen, a minor figure in the court of Pope Clement VI and again in the life of the scholar Julian Barneuve, who becomes a functionary in Vichy France. For each man, the world turns on a relationship with a charismatic woman.To say more is to spoil the book. However, ""The Dream of Scipio"" well repays a reader who possesses a bit of patience.M.

"This is a short memoir. It is about a relatively short period in the author's life when, although she is young and beautiful, she abstains from sex. There is a short time when a reader will think that the premise--examining one's life independent of a sexual relationship--is an interesting one. There is a longer time, in this short book, when the author spends much too long describing how she must fend off well meaning friends who wish to find her ""someone."" In fact, she must spend so much time impressing her friends (and readers) with how attractive she is, despite her choice to abstain, that a short book eventually comes to seem--endless.

"Jill Lepore is a scholar who has a gift for writing about history.  You don't have to be a specialist to enjoy reading her books or the articles on American history she writes as a New Yorker staff writer. In fact, it was her appealing article there about how she came to write about Jane Franklin that interested me in the book.In ""A Room of One's Own,"" Virginia Woolf imagined what life might have been like for Judith, a talented imaginary sibling of William Shakespeare. In ""Book of Ages,"" Lepore reconstructs the life of the real Jane Franklin, a younger sister of Ben. Letters and other documents of Jane Franklin's do exist, but there are great gaps, so sometimes Lepore must surmise, using other evidence, what life might have been like for this intelligent woman who lived most of her life on the edge of poverty.The resulting biography gives us a real woman, one who stands, for the first time, out of the shadow of her famous brother, whom she admires mostly from afar. Their affectionate relationship, which endures until her death, makes vivid a period of tumultuous political change.Like Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's ""The Midwife's Tale,"" Lepore's biography of Jane Franklin allows a reader to understand what life was like for humble women who endured war, the deaths of children, the difficulties of making a living, and illness. Jane Franklin's education was meager, as was typical for women of her era, but her brother Ben sent her spectacles that she might better read about him and about the great doings of the age. Lack of education did not stifle her curiosity; it only sharpened it.M.

"""MaddAddam,"" the last book in Margaret Atwood's dystopian trilogy set in a world beset by predatory corporations, plague, and environmental disaster, is like one of those musicals in which everyone comes on stage for the final number. The characters from Oryx and Crake"" (2003) are here, even Oryx and Crake themselves, if only in myth. The same is true for the characters from ""The Year of the Flood,""(2009) although in the new novel Zeb now takes the lead. If you have not read the earlier books, forget about ""MaddAddam"" for a while.Yes, Atwood does begin with a reprise, ""The Story So Far,"" but it is not enough. I had read both of the earlier books, but still found myself frustrated by constantly trying to remember events from those novels. Atwood herself seem aware of the problem, as she regularly weaves in little reminders of the previous action.  Finally in frustration, halfway through, I resorted to Wikipedia summaries of """"Oryx"" and ""Flood."" That helped, and you may, like a student sneaking a peek at SparkNotes, find yourself doing the same.The interesting thing about ""MaddAddam"" is that all of the ""types"" of the previous books--the Gardeners, the genetically engineered pacifist Crakers, the scientists, and the people, like Zeb, who move among these types, find themselves sharing the same refuge, along with a bunch of gene-spliced animals. It's rather like Noah's ark, except that the ""flood,"" a pandemic, has already happened. In these tight quarters, as the inhabitants must get ready to defend themselves against the murderous Painballers, Atwood asks this question: what sort of world will arise from the remnant of humans and quasi-humans that still survives? Jealousy flourishes in the compound. Ethical debates (capital punishment, abortion) arise. Even as weeds and kudzu break apart the ruined cities, trees and shrubs commence flowering, and bees return to human hives, the humans themselves seem to be reproducing true to type----or maybe not, if one considers the interspecies cooperation that sets up the final battle.""MaddAddam"" ties up most of the loose ends from ""Oryx"" and ""Flood,"" but it only makes sense if you read those two first.M.

"For the first 25 or so pages of this wonderful novel, I didn't know what to expect. In truth, I felt a little negative. Why was I reading a book about a man who seemed to be a fusty Boston Brahmin? As much as I love Boston, I don't have much patience with those for whom Harvard (and certain clubs, and the Athenaeum, and so on) are the center of the universe. And they were certainly at the center of George Apley's universe.As I read on, I was hooked, despite myself, on the story of this upright and well-meaning man for whom a rich life, at least as he comes to understand it, seems always just out of reach. Marquand narrates the story through the use of fictional letters by Apley's family members and friends (along with his replies). This technique lends a quality of delicate formality to the ""biography,"" as if one were reading one of those old books whose pages must be cut. Not only are the man and the world he inhabited lost to us, but also the very way in which men and women of his time expressed their thoughts and hopes.Its twin is William Dean Howells' ""The Rise of Silas Lapham."" This is a tale of a man from the provinces (Vermont, then) who makes a fortune in paint manufacturing and comes to take his place among the wealthy inhabitants of Gilded Age Boston. One can imagine Lapham and Apley meeting in some velvet-draped drawing room, and one can imagine as well their mutual incomprehension. The seemingly crass new world that Apley deplores is the sphere of Lapham; the snobberies and fingerbowls that so confuse Lapham is the sphere of Apley.Both of these novels give great pleasure and desire a wider readership.M.

"This was one of the few Mary Renault books I had not read, and indeed it had been quite a while since I picked up something by her, although I have always enjoyed her books.  An interesting profile by Daniel Mendelsohn in The New Yorker prompted me to read ""The Last of the Wine.""This account of a friendship between two young men, Alexias and Lysis, during the Peloponnesian War, is a serious book. One might call it ""scholarly,"" if such a word could be applied to historical fiction. Renault is intent on taking a reader to a time and place that is a lost world, so distant that one can only wonder at it, even if its depiction of love and friendship and intellectual awakening is something a modern reader might feel empathy for.I confess that I did not love this book, most likely because I found the characterizations of the few women who appear in the novel to be so sad.  There is Alexias' father recommending that should his new young wife bear a female child, the infant should be exposed. There are the enslaved war captives and the prostitutes and the famously (but was she?) shrewish wife of Socrates.

"Luke Barr's great-aunt is the famous writer M.F.K. Fisher. Years after her death, he visits a storage unit in California and uncovers a journal of a period she spent in Provence, in 1970. It turns out that, for different reasons, an entire cast of stars--Julia and Paul Child, Simone Beck, Richard Olney, James Beard, the editor Judith Jones---were in Provence at exactly the same time. The impulse to write a book about this, with the newly discovered journal as the centerpiece, must have been irresistible.It's an impulse that should have been resisted. First of all, the journal itself is not very interesting; it appears to mostly be a record of places visited and meals eaten. Oddly enough, M.F.K. Fisher is the vanishing figure in this chronicle of big personalities. It surely must be difficult to write about a close relative, but Barr simply can't bring to life this prickly and interesting woman. Read her books, instead.It should be no surprise that Julia Child is the dominant person in this book, both in accomplishment and personality. Barr's thesis is that 1970 is a watershed moment in American culinary history, when writers like Child broke away from formal (and ossified) French culinary practice, as well as from the snobbery and privilege associated with fine dining. He makes much of the already well-documented tension between Child and her collaborator, Simone Beck. However, this is a false thesis, designed to hold together a book that is mostly a collection of gossip, menus, meals eaten, chauffeurs befriended, Provencal landscapes described, more gossip, more menus, and on and on. By 1970, the food revolution was already well underway.The book has an annoying stylistic tic. Not content with quoting from the extensive and lively correspondence of these writers, Barr must give them made-up thoughts that he thinks they might have had. Since the subjects are all deceased, they are unable to defend themselves.  Thus, James Beard dwells on his unworkable diet. Richard Olney has caustic thought bubbles about just about everyone, and M.F. just wants to be alone. If you're interested in an antidote to this sort of thing, be sure to read Julia Child's ""My Life in France,"" which is a good book.However, if you enjoy the reverent food prose of, say, Bon Appetit, combined with the delicious scene painting of a posh travel magazine, along with a soupon of spicy People magazine gossip, perhaps you'll enjoy ""Provence."" Here's a sample:"" Norah had the oysters, M.F. had the clams, and they shared the scallops, which they agreed were beautiful. The Pomerol was superb and so was the cheese. The weather outside was a soft gray drizzle, and they were happy.""Two hundred and fifty pages of this is enough to give a reader indigestion.M.

"""The Radetzky March"" is one of the great depictions of a lost world, this one the Austro-Hungarian empire on the verge of World War I.  One can sense a new age coming in Roth's depiction of the ""borderlands,"" where nationalism is on the rise, but the poignancy of the novel lies in the collapse of the old: the relationships between parents and children; the dissolution of social hierarchies, changing sexual mores, the decline of a military ideal, the rotting away of the Hapsburg monarchy. All of this is reflected through three generations of the Trotta family.At the center of the novel is the aimless and dissolute Carl Joseph, who know he is unable to live up to his father's plans for him and so loses himself in alcoholism, gambling, and illicit love affairs. Yet Carl Joseph is not an unsympathetic figure, merely a weak one. Roth's great gift is to make Carl Joseph's world seem at once very distant from us and utterly familiar, so perfect are the details of setting and psychological characterization.This novel is one of the great ones.

"Many readers have pointed out that ""The Orphan Master's Son"" incorporates several different genres, from bildungsroman to love story. The central character, Jun Do, even disappears into a North Korean gulag and emerges as----someone else. However, as well-written and interesting as the novel's shifting perspectives are, they aren't the only things that make this a wonderful novel.It's all about the research. This is as knowledgeable and as in-depth a look at North Korea as you are likely to find, all wrapped up in an enthralling work of fiction.Lest you doubt Johnson's bona fides, look no further than some of the nonfiction material that generally gets little notice, unless you're a specialist. There are films like ""Crossing the Line"" and the wonderful ""A State of Mind""; memoirs like that of the deserter Charles Robert Jenkins or the prison memoir ""The Aquariums of Pyongyang""; third person accounts like Barbara Demick's ""Nothing to Envy."" Johnson's has read and seen it all, and then some.

"The basis of the plot of ""The Lowland"" is the Naxalite movement, a Maoist political insurgency in India that advocated violence on behalf of impoverished and landless Indian peasants.  The time period is the late 1960's-early 1970's, although a short section of the novel is set in an earlier period and most of the novel is set in the decades following. Two brothers, Udayan and Subhash Mitra, grow up in the ""lowland"" of Calcutta that give the novel its title; Udayan joins the insurgency and his elder brother Subhash does not. What happens to Udayan, who thinks he is acting only for himself, eventually transforms every member of his family.The novel is narrated through several different characters in the Mitra family. When Udayan in effect turns his back on his brother, his parents, and even his wife, he does so in what he considers to be the service of a higher cause. ""The Lowland"" seems to ask the question: is devotion to a political ideal worth the pain it inflicts on those one loves, even on those not yet born? There isn't a single answer, although the conclusion of the novel suggests that the answer is ""no.""I'm an admirer of Lahiri's short stories, and while I appreciated the ambitious scope of this novel, I did not find it as pleasing as some of her earlier work. The fine detail of the scenes set in India---surely essential for Western readers--is matched by an equal amount of detail for scenes set in the novel's other setting, Rhode Island. The American settings often seemed overly detailed, and I found my eye skipping past them. Lahiri also likes to convey the jumpy quality of thought by the use of sentence fragments, and I sometimes found myself longing for a paragraph where the sentences were complete. The novel must cover the almost the entire life span of Subhash Mitra and his wife, which leads to great jumps in time.""The Lowland"" is, most of all, about love. Udayan's violent break with his upbringing and his family turns out be no break at all, just a wrenching twist in a rope of interwoven lives.M.

"Many people dream of taking a road trip across the United States. If you're a writer, it makes sense to turn such a journey into a book. Or maybe not. ""The Longest Road"", has all of the interest of a trip on an interstate highway.Yes, Caputo and his wife and two dogs, traveling in a vintage Airstream, do avoid the interstates. They seek out the local good eats, the local colorful characters, and the quirky or bypassed towns. In a time of economic hardship (about which Caputo writes with great sympathy), he says he seeks to understand the forces that hold such a disparate country together.The book hasn't got an answer for that. Instead it relies on a formulaic approach to each section of the country, as the couple travels from Key West to Deadhorse, Alaska. And that formula is:  a little historical background; a mechanical problem and/or parking problem with the Airstream (named Ethel); the aforementioned interview with the local colorful person and dinner at the local joint; musings on the wonders (or not) of technology, GPS, etc.; and descriptions of the scenery. Many of the observations are hardly new; did you know that the Pacific Northwest had a serious coffee culture or that immigrants do the hard work in the slaughterhouses of Nebraska? These things, and many other of Caputo's observations, have been better written about elsewhere.Caputo saw a lot of interesting things, no doubt, but his journalist's skill does not extend to the travel writing genre. This book is a snoozer.M.

"""The Son"" is historical fiction that, thank heavens, does not ever glorify its subject, the settling and development of the state of Texas. It is a story of dispossession: of the Comanches (who had themselves pushed out other tribes); of the Tejanos, some of whom held ancient land grants from the King of Spain; of the small-scale settlers who first inhabited the borderland, often at great personal risk.  The dispossession of all of these groups is intertwined with the story of the McCullough family, whose enormous land holdings, and, later, oil riches, come to them through hard work, vision, luck, and murder.The novel is told primarily through three voices from different generations, and it moves back and forth among them. (You will need the genealogy printed at the beginning of the book; if you have a Kindle, you'd better bookmark that page.) Each voice is distinctive. There is the patriarch, Eli McCullough, whose is kidnapped by the Comanches as a child and who lives well into the 20th century; there is his son, Peter, whose more settled existence makes him a reflective and conflicted man; and there is Eli's great-granddaughter Jeanne Anne, who must manage the family's wealth at a time when few women ran a business.The novel's epigraph is from Gibbon, and, yes, this book is about a rise, a decline, and a fall. But whereas some of the characters in the book speculate nostalgically about a parallel between the settling of the land and a gradual loss of ""manly"" frontier attributes, Meyer does not. The real parallels in the novel are between what happens to the McCulloughs and what happens to other powerful families, like that of the Comanche chief Toshaway or the rancher Pedro Garcia. Their decline, and that of the McCulloughs, is complex, tragic, and also inevitable.And, for a reader in no danger of scalping, ""The Son"" is a powerfully good read.M.

"If you have not read Paul Theroux before, his most recent travelogue, ""The Last Train to Zona Verde"" is not the best book with which to begin, as it's a valedictory of sorts. Better to start with the travelogue ""Ghost Train to the Eastern Star,"" an account of his journey down the entire continent of Africa, from Egypt to South Africa. Better to start with ""The Lower River,"" his fictional account of a man who goes back in late middle age to the village in Malawi where he had once (like Theroux) been a Peace Corps volunteer.In ""The Last Train to Zona Verde,"" Theroux returns to the Cape Town shantytowns he describes in ""Ghost Train,"" then winds his way through two countries in southwest Africa, Namibia and Angola. Theroux is well known for his antipathy towards Western philanthropic organizations and Western celebrities (like Bono) and their efforts---mostly failed, by his account---to ameliorate poverty in Africa. One senses in this new book that he is striving to be fair-minded as he looks at the evidence of some improvement in the slums of Cape Town. By the end of the book, however, he is again thoroughly disillusioned---perhaps more so---by the great sprawling slums that surround the cities he visits. One person he meets comments that these slums seem to offer a vision of what the end of the world might look like.Theroux is happiest in the rural areas he travels through, but as he himself remarks, the bush is in the process of being lost to urbanization, to climate change, to tourism, and to warfare. Everywhere he goes, he sees Chinese laborers doing work that could be done by Africans. In the end, he declare himself unfit to chronicle what he is in fact chronicling:  ""The traveler in cities needs to understand cities better than I do and not to be disgusted by their chronic deficits; that traveler needs to care more, to be more expert in some areas, more innocent in others, more hopeful.""Don't take Theroux at his word here. ""The Last Train to Zone Verde"" is engaging from start to finish. The sights he describes are sometimes appalling, sometimes hopeful, sometimes comic, and always related in that clear-eyed, unsentimental voice that is like that of no other literary traveler. This is Theroux's last book about Africa, or so he says. Just don't read it first.M.

"Other readers have pointed out that this book is a collection of recipes that the Jamisons have published elsewhere. I see no problem with that, although it isn't made quite clear in the book. However, this is not a book that will teach you how to grill.  For that, you're better off consulting a publication by the Weber people or even some of the well-tested grilling recipes that Cooks Illustrated publishes.These recipes, as the Jamisons make clear, are mostly based on direct heat grilling. That is, you had better be standing by the grill if you don't want that nice chicken to burst into flames. There are also some recipes for the use of a spit. I confess to being rather indifferent griller; I much prefer the controls on a stove to the vagaries of charcoal, and as for a gas grill, what's the point except that it is outdoors?However, I tried. Dr. Pepper's Baby Back Ribs were tasty and left me with at least a quart of leftover sauce. The Dr. Pepper part could easily be subbed, however, in favor of Coke or Pepsi, as there is too much going on in the sauce for anyone to notice. Church-Picnic pork chops had a nice rub and came out well. Do not leave them unattended, however! There are quite a few variations in the book on hamburgers and other burgers, although a ""recipe"" for grilled hot dogs seemed silly.Buy this book if you are a committed griller and want to up your game with some fancier stuff---""Goat Cheese Wrapped in Grape Leaves"" or ""Dry Rubbed Tuna Steaks"" or ""Skewered Shrimp with Romesco Sauce.""

"Two kinds of stories intertwine in Transatlantic, a novel set in Ireland (and, later, Northern Ireland), the U.S., and Canada.  The first strand is historical fiction, an imagining of three events: the first non-stop transatlantic flight by John Alcock and Arthur Brown, which touched down in Ireland; the Irish sojourn of the abolitionist Frederick Douglass; and the establishment of the 1998 Northern Ireland peace accords through the efforts of former Senator George Mitchell. The second is another transatlantic story, that of the emigrant Irish housemaid, Lily Duggan, and her descendants, whose lives take them from Missouri to Newfoundland and then to Northern Ireland. These two strands, the historical lives and the ordinary lives, are bound by an unopened letter. Transatlantic is a novel about the impossibility of separating Big Events and private sorrows.The sheer span of the novel, over a time period of more than 150 years, works against it. McCann's earlier novel Let the Great World Spin (which I admire) explored intersecting lives in a particular time and place, the New York of the 1970's.  Its characters, fully-developed, were convincing. The ambitious sweep of Transatlantic, on the other hand, makes it necessary to render the characters in a kind of shorthand, through extended interior monologues built on thought fragments. These passages have a lot of work to do: depict setting, establish relationships between characters, link the famous characters to the ordinary ones, render an emotional state. In the end, it's too much work, and I felt my eyes sliding over these sections.The sections of the novel that follow the lives of Lily Duggan her daughter Emily, her granddaughter Lottie, and great-granddaughter Hannah are the best ones, despite the interior monologues. By contrast, the account of Frederick Douglass seemed contrived or perhaps constrained by facts, and the depiction of George Mitchell seemed oddly voyeuristic, given the fact that he is still living. That part felt a bit creepy; maybe it's because I'm from Maine, where Mitchell is revered.Still, there are sections of great power in Transatlantic, the kind I remembered from Let the Great World Spin. In particular, the last chapter, set in contemporary Northern Ireland, pulls all of the strands together with lyric intensity. If you're looking for a successor to Let the Great World Spin, I don't think you'll find it in Transatlantic, but a novel by McCann always has its pleasures.M.

"This clever and enjoyable novel is constructed around an authorial wink. The novel, told entirely in the second person, follows an unnamed narrator who lives in a country that looks a lot like Pakistan. Beginning as an impoverished village boy, he migrates to the city and joins millions of his countrymen in an attempt, through hard work, cleverness, and sheer nerve, along with (as he prospers) bribery, deception, and violence, to rise from his beginnings. Hence, the chapters are structured on some tenet of a business self-help book: ""Move to the City, ""Don't Fall in Love,""  Learn From a Master,"" and so on. The wink comes in the author's knowledge that readers in places like the United States might  also be looking for some ""self-help"" in understanding a particular part of the world.Without giving away the novel's last few self-help principles, it is fair to say that they move away from the business model and toward an exploration of human dignity in an economic culture that leaves the poor, which is to say most people, ""with their faces pressed to that clear window on wealth afforded by ubiquitous television."" It's a conclusion that is a commentary on avarice and on human desires, whether in an unnamed country in the so-called developed world or in other countries that consider themselves a good deal more developed.M.

"This complicated novel, set primarily during the period of the Gulf War, is of interest for its perspective on the relationship between America and Pakistan and for its depiction of everyday life in Karachi and in rural Pakistan.There are many stories here, told through different narrators and through shifts back and forth in time. There is the story of an unhappy young Pakistani man attending an American college that seems to be a cross between Amherst and UMass. There is another plot line that follows the lives of several different women, from different generations, as they push up against religious and cultural barriers. At times the novel offers a lyrical rendering of Pakistani scenes like a seaside cove and a silkworm factory, while at other times it strives to depict the difficulties of life in a sprawling city where the water and electricity are never reliable. Yet another story follows a village man who comes to the city and, for a time, casts his lot with dispossessed men empowered by a flood of cheap American arms. All of this is wound around a love story that seems designed to appeal to---it's hard to say to whom, exactly. The illicit embraces of the lovers, Dia and Daanish, ultimately prove wearying to read about, and thus the final revelation of the fate of their love is only a fizzle.This might have been a better novel had it not tried to do so many things, in so many different voices. The dialogue is often flat and predictable, and the author's use of metaphor is sometimes cringe-inducing.For its depiction of life in Pakistan, I much prefer Daniyal Mueenuddin's In Other Rooms, Other Wonders.M.

"This book is a good guide to getting started using a pressure cooker. As in all of the publications produced by the Cooks Illustrated People, the recipes are well written and there is plenty of additional information---in this case, brands of pressure cookers and how they work. (Mine is a Fagor.)I tried four recipes, one from each of the first four chapters. All were tasty. Chipotle Pork and Hominy Stew, from the soups, Stews, and Chili section, was delicious. Braised Chicken Thighs with Potatoes (Fast and Easy Suppers) was a good weeknight dish that combined main meal and side, with the plus of a nice sauce. Ziti with Sausage and Peppers (One Pot Pastas and Pasta Sauces) came out astonishingly well; I had my doubts about cooking pasta in a pressure cooker!  The ziti was perfectly cooked, and the whole thing came together in 30 minutes. We splurged on osso bucco  (Big Roasts), which does take 2.5 hours. The recipe was a bit unclear on how to tie them. Even though they kind of came apart in the pot, they were very tasty.All of the recipes have a troubleshooting guide that gives acceptable substitutions, like different kinds of pasta. However, it is very difficult to figure out if the recipes can be adjusted (down) for size; the recipes seem designed for 6 people, for the most part. The recipes often warn against making changes, so I was stumped on this topic.I liked the feature called ""the language of the pressure cooker."" It looks like a sidebar, however, and I wish it had been more prominent. At first, when starting a recipe, I didn't know the difference between a natural release and a quick release. This section explains things like that. All recipes have two numbers in the bottom left corner of the page. The larger number is the time the recipe needs to be under pressure (and it can take a pot a while to get there), while the smaller number is the total time needed.All in all, this is a solid guide to using a pressure cooker.

Most of the unrhymed poems themselves are not long or particularly difficult to read, but the recurring themes---war, childhood loneliness, adult loneliness, darkening city evenings, shabby apartments---are often painful to read about.There are bits of happiness, too---a fragment of natural beauty, jazz, a lover, a book of poetry. In fact, one of my favorite lines, from ""Romantic Sonnet,"" is this one: ""Happiness, you are the bright red lining/Of the dark winter coat/Grief wears inside out.""

"This is the second edition of the well-regarded Bringing Words to Life: Robust Vocabulary Instruction. In addition to incorporating the newest research on vocabulary instruction, it now addresses the Common Core standards and the Response to Intervention (RTI) structure. A new chapter, on ""Vocabulary and Writing,"" discusses the intuitive sense that most teachers have that a rich vocabulary improves writing, although it also notes the paucity of research on this topic.Bringing Words to Life makes a powerful case for the need for systematic direct instruction in vocabulary and persuasively debunks the idea that students can readily learn the meanings of new words simply from context and reading exposure. Unlike so many education texts, it is well written, with clear summaries of current research along with excellent descriptions and examples of how to carry out ""robust"" vocabulary instruction in the classroom. Bringing Words to Life encourages high expectations for even the youngest students, who can readily learn to move from the everyday (Tier One) words that they frequently encounter to what the authors call ""Tier Two"" words; for instance, ""talking about"" something can become ""mention.""This book won't write a teacher's lesson plans but it can fill them with ideas. Like any new curricular idea, learning to incorporate rich vocabulary takes practice, both for teachers and for students.As a practitioner of the Orton Gillingham method of dyslexia remediation, I wondered why the book makes no reference to the use of morphology (prefixes, suffixes, Latin roots, Greek combining forms) as an efficient way to expand a student's vocabulary. In response to my inquiry, one of the authors indicated that a companion book, Creating Robust Vocabulary: Frequently Asked Questions and Extended Examples (which I have not seen), does examine the use of morphemes. This author also indicated that she considered this to be a useful approach.Anyone who works with students who have limited vocabularies should own this book. It contains that rare combination of theory and practice that distinguishes the best books about teaching.M.

"This is a delightful book, funny and dark at the same time. Since the perpetrators of the explosion that brought down the plane of the real General Zia ul-Haq in 1988 have never been conclusively identified, Hanif imagines how it might have happened. Most of the novel alternates between the voice of a young Army cadet named Ali Shigri and the voice of the security-obsessed General himself.Wild plots abound amid the bloated security apparatus of the modern Pakistani state. General Zia, he of the oiled mustache and expanding midsection, is bent on the Islamization of his country, although his subordinates are mostly bent on getting and keeping power. His opposite number, the lowly Shigri, has to keep one eye open when in group prayer, the better not to make an embarrassing spiritual mistake. The action moves at dizzying speed from the lowest, most filthy dungeons to the rarified dining rooms of powerful officials.The humor is crazy, sometimes sophomoric, always amusing. How else can one shoot barbs at fat generals, loony CIA operatives, manipulative information ministers, and greedy ""widows"" brought in as props for the General's charity? How else to mock a third world country with, as one character puts it, a first world security service?By the time the mangoes actually get around to exploding, the madcap humor does begin to wear a little thin, rather like the second half of Saturday Night Live.

The food history part of the volume is very attractive, with full color reproductions and facsimile pages from each cookbook, along with an introduction for each and several longer essays by famous food persons like Alice Waters and Laura Shapiro. The cookbooks span the 20th century, from Fannie Farmer and Sarah Tyson Rorer to Thomas Keller and Mark Bittman. Recommended recipes from each appear in a box on the page, with page references to those that are actually incorporated into the 501 section of the book. This section offers hours of pleasurable browsing.What the book is not---at least not exactly---is a proper cookbook. Of the 501 recipes, some are (as the editor notes) primarily of historical interest. Others are just plain interesting and create a fine record of changing culinary tastes. There is one problem.

Take his Macaroni and Cheese, the one with Butter-Poached Maine Lobster with Creamy Lobster Broth and Mascarpone-Enriched Orzo. The main recipe is there, but not recipes for three essential components, the creamy lobster broth, the beurre mont, and the coral oil.

"Yes, this is a kind of spy novel, set in a dreary Britain of coal miner strikes and power shortages, circa 1972. The only place thats  warm is bed. And thats where the spy, a young woman Cambridge graduate named Serena Frume, ends up, quite happily, when she falls in love with the subject of her first assignment for MI5.However, this is also a novel about writing, about literary taste, and about the shifty line between reality and imagination.  Serena and her lover, the writer T.H. Haley, both love books, but they have entirely different tastes. She prefers the real and falls in love with a mental image of Haley before she has even met him, simply by conjuring him up from the characters in his short stories. He, in turn, tries to interest her in poetry and in more avant garde fiction. Many reviewers have pointed out that Haley seems to resemble, in some respects, the young Ian McEwen. A reader will realize pretty quickly that McEwen is going to have fun with Serenas disdain for what she calls literary tricksThere is also some interesting writing in Sweet Tooth on the extent to which governments enlist the arts, either covertly or directly, to buttress political arguments.A reader interested in the spy novel aspects of Sweet Tooth might do well to beat a retreat back to Le Carr.  McEwens novel is for the bookish, readers who enjoy thinking about the kind of espionage involved in creating novels.M.

"I've never owned a flexible spatula like this one, which means I've spent most of my life using square-edged spatulas in round pans. This is fine until you need to get something intact out of the pan. OXO has designed this spatula for omelets, but it works just as well for lifting the edge of a crepe (to flip it, for which I then usually use my fingers). It neatly lifts the edge of a frittata, to let the uncooked egg run beneath, or a grated potato cake, to check for browning. Someone who likes to cook will appreciate this utensil.M.

"Mama's Milk is an excellent book for a young child with a newborn sibling. The detailed drawings (and an illustrated spread of facts at the back of the book) explain a process that the child himself probably does not remember, except through photographs. Although the spare, rhyming text is aimed at toddlers, there is enough factual information to hold the interest of an older child in the early elementary grades. The bilingual text will also interest this older child, and the drawings will appeal to a child of any age.

"This lightweight plastic cutting board is well-designed. In addition to the special edge that helps funnel cut food into a pan or bowl, it has a raised edge whose material helps anchor the board on a counter so that it does not slide around.

"I generally avoid memoirs, but what drew me to Wild was its setting on the Pacific Crest Trail. I've only hiked a tiny bit of it, but someone close to me hiked the whole thing, from the Mexican border to the Canadian border. In my role as supply-box-sender (like Strayed's friend Lisa), I got a pretty good sense of the strength and determination required to undertake such a hike. It's clear from the book that Strayed possesses those qualities, too.Of course a redemption story (and this is one) is no good unless there is plenty of sin to be redeemed, and Wild is full of that: drugs, sex, bad boyfriends, a dysfunctional family, a broken marriage. The death of Strayed's mother begins the book, and grieving runs through it. This is the part I liked the least, but then I told you I don't like memoirs. If you've read Mary Karr or Tobias Woolf or Dave Eggers, you've got the picture here, and those three are better memoirists.The trail part of the story is more compelling. It seems likely to me that Strayed was in possession of the necessary distance-hiker strength and determination before she ever set foot on the trail. Her accounts of her painful feet, of her loneliness and desire (more than once) to quit, of her physical and spiritual hungers, of the people she meets and the dangers she encounters seem true and are often moving. The resupply boxes with the twenty dollar bills, the new (and well-chosen) books and some other amusing items function almost like a character. Will they be there for her or not?The book ends in a literary way, with Strayed, at the end of her hike, looking out at the Columbia River, the border between Oregon and Washington. It's clear that this is meant to be a metaphor for a better life going forward and a difficult life left behind. That's nice, but the rest of the book suggests that life is really more complicated than that.M.

"In my ancient student days, professors generally referred to Margaret Fuller in dismissive tones. They acknowledged her brilliance, but never failed to mention her physical homeliness and the way that she could dominate a room with her talk. In short, she made men uncomfortable, both in her own time and after her death.  (Another famous 19th century woman, George Eliot, had a similar effect; many a commentary is sure, even today, to mention her lack of physical beauty.)In Megan Marshall, Margaret Fuller has, a last, a biographer whose appreciative and sympathetic portrait may give this remarkable woman her due. The book is subtitled ""A New American Life,"" and what a life this is, beginning with Fuller's childhood, when her difficult father gave her the kind of classical education usually reserved for boys. The family itself existed in a kind of genteel poverty (and sometimes real poverty) that made it certain that Margaret Fuller would have to work for a living and, after her father's death, support her mother and her younger siblings.The biography traces Fuller's life as a teacher and as an inspiration for other women who aspired to intellectual achievement. It follows her journey to the West (now the American middle west), where she wrote about the destruction of Native American culture. It points out the physical illnesses, including spinal curvature and migraines, which would have sidelined a less resilient person. And it details her life as a journalist in New York, writing on books and culture for Horace Greeley's Herald TribuneMost interesting to me was the account of Fuller's years in Italy during the fight for Italian unification. If there was ever an embedded journalist, 19th century style, it was she, sending eyewitness accounts back to the Tribune. Her biographer gives a particularly balanced account of her liaison with Giovanni Ossoli, of the birth of their child, and of the difficulties that attended a mother and wife who had to keep on earning a living in the midst of a revolution, all the while concealing her relationship, unorthodox for its time, from the eyes and ears even of those who loved her.The shipwreck will break your heart.Margaret Fuller: A New American Life is a detailed, scholarly biography. Marshall incorporates Fuller's actual words whenever she can, usually to good effect, although sometimes the incorporation of many short successive quotations conveys the quality of her speech but slows down Marshall's own prose. However this is a quibble. Marshall set out to let us hear Margaret Fuller's voice as it must have sounded to her contemporaries, and in this she succeeds very well.M.

"This steamer's chief virtue is that it rolls up in a neat cylinder, making it easy to store in a drawer. Anther advantage is that it is silicone, which means that things like dumplings don't stick. (I tested this with gyozas.) It will hold approximately the same amount of food as a regular metal collapsible steamer. It's true that the silicone material means that the steamer can bend to fit differently sized pots, but the high handles, while making it easy to lift it out of a hot pot, limit its use to a fairly capacious pot.

"This appealing book for preschool age children explores the world of play as it pertains to a variety of animal species, including humans.  Each page depicts, in colorful drawings, adults engaged in play with their young; there are familiar animals, like cats and dogs, along with less familiar animals like wombats and sea lions.The youngest children will enjoy pointing and naming these animals, while an older child may be interested in the specialized names for the baby animals, names like  ""calf"" or ""joey,"" some of which are common to more than one species. (Each animal is carefully identified.) There is a simple rhyming story line, which helps to build phonemic awareness in preschool children. Finally, older children may notice that ""play"" is sometimes ""work,"" as in the drawings of a father helping a child learn to cook or a sea lion catching a fish.This is a beautiful little book that aims to show that all creatures love to play.M.

"I hope it will be helpful to other readers to indicate what this book is and what it is not.First of all, it is a work of scholarship. It traces, with lawyerly precision, the members of the entire Hemings family and their associations with Thomas Jefferson. The use of the word ""family"" in the title of the book is important, as the book begins with Elizabeth Hemings, the daughter of an African slave woman and a white man. She and all of her children had relationships with Jefferson; the book is about several individuals, not just her daughter, Sally Hemings.Second, the book is meticulous in building its case for the nature of the relationships between Jefferson and the various Hemings family members. It relies on what records do exist, and it is careful not to project contemporary values onto eighteenth century relationships. Sometimes the author does speculate about how an individual might have felt or thought, but she makes it clear that it is indeed speculation.Third, it is true that the book does, at times, become repetitious. Gordon-Reed ponders every possible aspect of the Hemings ""case"" like a lawyer determined to present overwhelming evidence. However, although at times I did skim, I did not put the book down. It was just too interesting.Now for what the book is not. It is not popular history. Gordon-Reed is not Stephen Ambrose or David McCullough, to name two eminently readable historians. To enjoy this book requires an interest in Jefferson and a bit of patience.Nor is it the ""story"" of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, although that liaison is part of the book. It is about much more than that.Above all, this book is an account of how slavery distorts human relationships. Jefferson was sometimes a benevolent master. He freed several in the Hemings family. Yet his relationships with these enslaved people, some of whom were his own children, are complicated, calculated, and often painful. Everything in ""The Hemingses of Monticello"" underscores the truth of what another enslaved man, Frederick Douglass, would publish in his Narrative, two decades after Jefferson's death.M.

"This fine historical novel is based on a period covering about one hundred years in Japanese history, from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century. Following the arrival of St. Francis Xavier, Catholic missionaries, most of them Portuguese, came to Japan to convert its people and to establish seminaries to educate native priests. Christianity took root in the areas around Nagasaki and Kyushu, in southern Japan, and at one point the converts may have totaled as many as a quarter million. Ultimately, however, the missionaries and their converts fell out of favor with the powerful Tokugawa shogunate, whose rulers began to outlaw Christianity through torture and by forcing converts to apostasize.The protagonist of Silence, Sebastian Rodrigues, arrives with a companion priest near the end of this period, when persecution has forced believers to hide their faith. Almost immediately they are forced into hiding and almost as quickly they are forced to contemplate the idea that martyrdom of some sort may be their fate. The trials that ensue test not only Rodrigues's faith, but the very concept of martyrdom as he understands it.  Even as he thinks of the death of Jesus, a type of suffering to which he aspires, he must also consider the mysterious apostasy of Ferreira, the Portuguese Provincial about whom nothing more had ever been heard. When the time comes, whose life will be the pattern for his own: Christ's sacrifice or Ferreira's renunciation?Shusaku Endo is himself a Japanese Catholic, and his novel also raises these questions: is it possible for an imported religion to adapt itself to a very different culture? And in the adaptation, will the new religion bend so deeply to accommodate differing customs that it is no longer recognizable?M.

"The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin gave Truth Like the Sun a big shout-out in her end of the year wrap-up of ten books she enjoyed in 2012. On the strength of that, I decided to read it, even though I have yet to read a good novel about newspapers and journalists. Most recently, I was disappointed in Tom Rachman's newspaper novel The Imperfectionists, but I still liked it better than this wooden account of Seattle circa 1962 juxtaposed with Seattle circa 2001.Overall, this novel feels like interesting material in search of a story. The newspaper characters are almost laughably stock: the pusillanimous editor who fears offending the local bigwigs, the solitary young crusading journalist, the rumpled and overweight ""true"" journalist whose time has come and gone. The subject of the newspaper's investigative journalism, Roger Morgan, impresario of the Seattle World's Fair, is a slightly more complex character, at least when he's not in the middle of one of the boring set pieces in which he surveys the fair and/or greets a visiting dignitary.In fact, you'll want to bypass some of the descriptive passages altogether, unless you live in Seattle and enjoy the touches of local color. This is a novel in which hot mugs ""steam,"" nursing homes smell (surprise!) of disinfectant and other things, and the young reporter's hair (one of her physical assets) is compared, rather amazingly, to an oak tree.Maslin called Truth Like the Sun ""a flat-out great read with the spirit of a propulsive, character-driven 1970s movie.""  Well, yes, there are flat-out great reads about city life and politics that do make great movies, although it isn't this particular novel. Another author comes to mind, himself a great chronicler of the sort of police corruption at the center of Truth Like the Sun.  His books make great movies, too, like Mystic River. However this writer lives in Boston and his name is Dennis Lehane.  Perhaps he could be convinced to write a newspaper novel.M.

"Raised From the Ground, now in English translation for the first time, is a good introduction to the work of the Portuguese writer Jose Saramago. His style takes some getting accustomed to, since it consists of long strings of subordinate clauses. It is not long, however, before the style is familiar, and the narrative line is in any case not hard to follow. The story follows the lives of members of the peasant Mau-Tempo family through the two world wars and the rise and fall of the dictator Antonio Salazar.In addition to the Mau-Tempos and the other denizens of a rural village of southern Portugal, there are three big players in the novel. The Church is represented by the recurring voice of Father Agamedes, who whispers his contempt for the peasantry into the ear of Senora Clemencia, the wife of a feudal (that's the only word for it, even if it is the 20th century) landlord. The system of vast landholdings concentrated in the hands of a very few and farmed by serfs like the Mau-Tempos is supported by the military apparatus of the State. Its primary function seems to be to put down--by intimidation, violence, and torture-- any attempt by the peasants to improve their miserable standard of living.  Church, landed aristocracy, and State are bound together; beneath them is the rural peasantry in a region where the twentieth century seems to have barely intruded.The overlapping phrases and clauses of Saramago's prose permit him to adopt a variety of voices, including that of a sarcastic narrator who pretends at times that he can't believe what he is describing, even though it is clear that he does. This translation has useful footnotes where needed to elucidate certain aspects of the history of modern Portugal, as well as to explain some jokes that do not translate. A reader unfamiliar with the history of Portugal is at no disadvantage. Indeed, the bitterest passages of commentary put one in mind of the commentaries in Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. The determination of the privileged to remain privileged at the expense of the impoverished looks the same wherever you go.M.

"This beautiful book, lavishly illustrated and engagingly written, is, I fear, going to fall into the wrong hands. Why? It looks like a so-called coffee table book (lush photos, oversized format). It would be a shame if it ended up on, well, coffee tables, to eventually be covered with old magazines or used as a handy coaster or, in better circles, to perform a merely decorative ""house beautiful"" function.It deserves to fall into better hands, specifically those of your favorite vegetable-growing friend or relative. Plenty has been written about Monticello, its architecture and beautiful grounds. This book is about Thomas Jefferson's vegetable gardens.Might you be interested in what varieties of lettuce Jefferson grew? What sort of insects attacked his crops? How he saved seeds and swapped them with his neighbors? Then this book is for you. You may never live in a house like Monticello, but you can put its vegetable varieties on your table.The book is divided in two. The first half focuses on Jefferson's interest in gardening and the development and restoration of the Monticello gardens. It presents a well-researched look at the state of American horticulture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The author, Peter Hatch, Director of Grounds and Gardens at Monticello, also pays homage to the African-American slaves whose labor built Jefferson's gardens and whose own garden plots often supplied the big house.The second half is a detailed look at many of the vegetables grown in the gardens, including cultural information. It is here where Jefferson's passion for experiment becomes clear. He was always trying new seeds, such as varieties of corn brought back by the Lewis and Clark expedition. His frustrating experiences with melon growing will be familiar to anyone who has tried. This section is organized by botanical families.Finally, there is a good index, an extensive bibliography, and a guide to sources of heirloom seeds. It's a lovely book; you can't go wrong.M.

"This novel, shortlisted for the 2012 Man Booker Prize, is the kind of book that will inevitably be described as ""elegant"" or ""subtle"" or ""beautiful"" or ""expertly crafted.""  I like that last descriptor, probably because it sums up the kind of book whose admirable qualities leave you cold.The story is short, a kind of mystery wrapped around a tale of desire set in the south of France, where the protagonists are on holiday. The novel opens with a body floating in a pool. As the story develops, there are lots of clues to more than one mystery (what IS the other thing under the bed?). By the end, everybody is spying on (or peeking at) everybody else. Deborah Levy is a playwright as well as a novelist, and one feels that the dramatic qualities of this novel might have been better served by, well, a play, or maybe a film. As the beautiful but creepy and manipulative Kitty, I see Scarlett Johansson.Anyway, ""Swimming Home"" did not win the Man Booker and Hilary Mantel's ""Bring Up the Bodies"" did.

While we love cooking with it, we do not enjoy the cleanup and maintenance a traditional cast iron skillet requires.What we really like about this new Gorham skillet is that it cooks like a traditional cast iron skillet, but it looks and cleans us like a normal modern pan. It distributes heat well and allows you to do things traditionally requiring an old school cast iron skillet. This skillet also has a really good nonstick surface.

"REVIEW UPDATE 4/30/2015I am downgrading this radio from 5 stars to one star after a month of using it. I have always been a sucker for these feature rich, low cost Boufeng/Pofung radios but have finally had it. This one has started malfunctioning after less than a month. This is the third Baufeng/Pofung radio I have had go out in the last year. I do not abuse these radios . . . they sit on my desk and are not dropped or otherwise stressed.Another gripe with this radio was that I could not get it to ever program with CHIRP. Yes, the instructions say to use the Baufeng software, but given I have my radio configurations saved as CHIRP configurations, it is annoying that these radios (at least the one I had) would not work with CHIRP.I love a good deal, but I am not fooling with these cheap radios any more, and will look into something more expensive that will last.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis radio is very similar to the popular and affordable Baofeng UV-5R radio. If you are familiar with the UV-5R, you will be comfortable using and programming this radio. The major upgrade between this radio and the UV-5R is that this radio (the BF-F9+) has higher power (8 watts vs 5 watts), and allows you to select the power level between 8 watts, 4 watts, and 1 watt. The advantage of this is that for longer distance communication, you can select higher power level. For nearby communication, or hitting a nearby repeater, you can turn the power level down to extend battery life.What I really like about this unit is that it packs a whole lot of features in a small affordable package. As of the time of writing this review, this unit is priced about $5 more than the UV-5R, I think the extra power is well worth spending the extra money to get this model.Things that I don't like about this radio. First is that the instructions are hard to read and dont really give all the information you need. To program the radio, you really need to connect it to the computer, and program it with software. The issue with this is that it requires a special cord, which costs almost as much as the radio itself.  Luckily, I already have the cord.Bottom line is that this is a full featured radio at an affordable cost. It is a great entry level radio into the world of HAM.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GC3TERIUUQOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7LAXWK#wasThisHelpful","R2GC3TERIUUQOS","AQ2FC1DLKVD8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2FC1DLKVD8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years we have been using a shark NV22L vacuum (priced on amazon at about $150). So in this review I will compare this Samsung MotionSync to the lesser priced NV22L.As far as overall design, I like the Samsung. It is easier to maneuver, and easier to get under things. It takes a little to get used to the way the unit moves and steers, but once you get the hang of it, it is wonderful to use. It works well on both hard wood floors and carpets. The noise level for the machine is about typical.The Samsung wins hands down as far as ease of manuevering and making quick work of vacuuming a room. My only reservation about this machine is that I feel like the shark NV22L is picking up more dirt. For our floors, I am finding that the samsung does not pick up the dirt quiet as well as the shark.I am happy to have the Samsung and intend to continue to use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31W7D4NKNQGAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOD3FM0#wasThisHelpful","R31W7D4NKNQGAU","AQ2FC1DLKVD8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2FC1DLKVD8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy drinking tea, and so am always looking for a way to heat water quickly. I have a tea kettle for the stove top, but it takes a while to bring a kettle of tea water to a boil. So, I was excited to get the chance to try this KitchenAid electric kettle.I am very impressed. The kettle makes a pot of boiling water really fast. I like the fact that the handle remains cool to the touch, so after the water boils, you can directly hold the handle to pour the water. The water pours from the spout nicely, without running back up the spout . . . a problem I have had with other products.We have really hard water where I live, and I have found that products like this last longer if you only use RO or bottled water, so I will not be using tap water in this unit.

"There is a lot to like about this little screwdriver. First I like the two position handle. I prefer the ""pistol"" orientation as it is shown in the picture. This is best for big jobs as it is easier on the writes. I also am impressed with the battery life and the torque the screwdriver provides. Plenty of power for most jobs. I also like the little LED light that lights the work area when you are using it. It comes with a nice assortment of screwdriver heads.The main limitation of this screw driver is that it is a single speed. I would have preferred if it was variable speed. The second minor quibble is that it would be nice if the screwdriver heads were in some way attached to or in the unit. They are in a seperate little plastic box, which means over time they are easy to lose.Bottom line this is a nice unit at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTE0KK1RKXML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O13K9JY#wasThisHelpful","RWTE0KK1RKXML","AQ2FC1DLKVD8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2FC1DLKVD8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this product in the hopes of improving the Brix measurements on my greenhouse hydroponics vegetables.

"I have struggled for years to get good wireless coverage in my home. I have a two story house, and there are several internal rock walls, which creates a challenge in getting good coverage throughout the house. So, when I was offered the chance to review this product, I jumped on it.First, as wireless network gear goes, this was relatively painless to set up. Basically, you plug it in somewhere between your dead spot and the main wireless router. You then connect to the Range Extender as you would a wireless network. This allows you to access a very simple setup routine which helps you get it connected. Then, once it is connected, it disappears from your wireless choices, and you simply connect to your normal wireless network. The device works seamlessly in the background.I did verify that I now have good connections in the deadspots in my house.It did take a little work to find just the right spot to make it work. The setup software warns you if you have it in a spot that is weak in signal. This of course motivates you to move the extender closer to the router. But, you can get it to the point that it connects to the router, but does not light up your dead spots. It took me about 10 or fifteen minutes of playing with it to get just the right spot where it had a solid connection to the wireless router, and provided a good strong signal to the rest of the house.So, this turned out to be a relatively painless setup, and I now have good coverage in my house for the first time.

"This is a great BP monitor that gives rock solid readings. Unfortunately, most of the home BP units I have tried give inconsistent and inaccurate readings.

"There is a vast array of home BP monitors out there with an array of ""Bells and Whistles"". At the end of the day, though, what really matters is the accuracy and consistency of the measurements. I have tried over a dozen different home BP measurement units,and unfortunately, most do not give accurate and reliable readings. In fact, a number of the units I have tried would suggest I need to be on BP medicine, when in fact my BP is fine.I have found the Omron line of home BP measurement units to give very accurate, reliable and reproducible results. One of the things I like about the omron devices is the stiff arm cuff. I have found that these stiff cuffs help give accurate and consistent readings as compared to the soft bendable cuffs. (I should also add that I have not found any of the wrist BP units that would give accurate readings).So, the bottom line is that I give this Omron product high marks because it gives me reliable readings that I can depend on. In addition to that, this unit also has all the bells and whistles. If you want to chart your BP, you can download an ap and use this with your tablet or smartphone.

"I could not get this to work with Android. I have four android devices, some less than a year old. When I tried to download and install the required Ap, I was told that none of my devices were compatible. Note in the listing title it says ""QardioArm Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor (Apple iOS and Android)"". Note that being incompatible with 4 out of 4 modern android devices would indicate that this unit is not generally Android compatible. The company WEB site lists it as Android compatible, but in the instructions (that you read after you buy the unit) just mentions iphone and apple devices.The second issue I had with this unit is the instructions are almost unreadable. Very tine text, which is light grey, on a white background.I can not comment further on this, as the software would not load on my android devices, and the unit requires the link with a phone or tablet to work.If you have an iPhone, you probably should ignore my review and read the reviews from iphone users. If you have an Android, you need to dig pretty deep before ordering and be sure this will work with your device.Bottom Line: I have over a half dozen different BP monitors. At the end of the day, the best one in my mind is the Omron BP7911T. It just works. Accurate, reproducible results. It has the stiff style cuff, which I have found gives the most accurate readings.

Almost anywhere you are, you can get local weather and UV data with a variety of free weather apps. The free apps are driven from more high end weather equipment which would likely be more useful than this device.

"My hot water heater has a pump on it, and I wanted a way to turn the pump off at night so to not pump hot water around the house at night when it is not needed. The pump is fairly high current and beyond the safety rating of most home timers, which are designed for lamps and such. I was happy to get the chance to try this switch, which is able to switch a whopping 15 amps.The unit is fairly easy to program, and the buttons are intuitive. It allows you to set on times and off times for anything connected to it. You can program it individually for each day of the week, or you can program a sequence which is the same for each day. In addition, it has a random setting, which would be useful for controlling a lamp if you are going to be away for a few days.The unit works well. The only thing I did not like is the packaging is very unfriendly, and I had trouble getting the unit out of the package even with a heavy pair of kitchen scissors.

"I had originally given this 2 stars, but after using it a few weeks, I give it 5 stars. The reason is that it gives a close comfortable shave at an affordable price. Initially I experienced some irritation on the neck, but after a few days of use, I never experienced irritation again. After using it almost a month, I can say it is a good razor for the price.The bottom line on electric razors is this. None of them will shave as close as a blade. The high end Braun electric razors with the cartridges that automatically clean the razor after each shave give the closest shave of the electric razors. The downside of these is that they cost close to $200, and the cleaning cartridges are expensive, and you end up spending as much on the cleaning cartridges as you do the razor. If you are not concerned about purchase cost, or cost of consumables, the high end Braun razors are the best.For those wanting a decent shave at an affordable price This Remington is a good option. What I like about the 3 head rotary design is that it is very good about getting all the whiskers in just a few passes on the face. In fact, I find that it is better than the Braun at getting all the whiskers and not leaving missed patches. It actually takes me less time to shave with this Remington than with my high end Braun.So, after using for some time, I can give this razor a thumbs up as giving a good close shave at a reasonable price.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have been using electric razors for over ten years, and always have my eye out for an affordable option that will give good results. This razor caught my eye because it is a name brand and priced under $30.Unfortunately, I was not able to get acceptable results from this razor. I have used it for several days and it is causing irritation and razor burn on my neck. On the remainder of my face it is not causing irritation, but it is not giving a close shave. In saying the shave is not close, I am comparing to other electric razors. By the afternoon, I have noticeable stubble.I would suggest spending more and getting a Braun electric razor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ASOM841BLDDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMNLD4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3ASOM841BLDDM","AQ2FC1DLKVD8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2FC1DLKVD8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very easy to use, quick and accurate. Gives you your pulse/heart rate and your pulse oxygen saturation percentage. Requires two AAA batteries not included. One thing to pay attention is when putting in the batteries it looks like both are supposed to go in the same direction. But the positive end is the opposite for each battery. Some reviews have complained the screen looks scratchy or scuffed. That's because there is a thin plastic layer you are supposed to peel off that's covering the screen.

"In Material Girls teens rule the fashion industry and decide what's in and what's out. But it's a cut throat world and as one of our heroes, Marla, finds out, even at seventeen you can be over the hill. Marla goes from being on the fashion court that listens to designers (drafters) pitch their concepts and decides whether they are worthy to being a mere drafter herself after she can no longer vote along with the rest of the court. She and others are starting to rebel against the decisions of the powers that be and want more individuality. Our other hero, Ivy, is a pop singer who also needs to stay on top of trends to keep her career on top. The book is easy to read and I liked the basic concept.

"No spoilers here so the short review is: I liked it. The setup is we find our hero, Dexter, confined in a maximum security prison for murders he actually did not commit. He's in the cell for weeks until finally a public defendant comes to see him. The case being put up against and the procedures are irregular. Something is not quite right. Deborah doesn't even come to visit Dexter until a few weeks have passed and then it's just to have Dexter sign papers giving her custody of his kids. Things do not look good for our hero. This last book flows wonderfully. All of Dexter's wit and darkness are here and the writing is crisp. This last book may not end the way everyone wants it to but I enjoyed taking a ride with the mind of Dexter for one last trip. For those expecting this book to pick up where the tv series left off it does not. The show and book did not match up so there are characters and events that happened differently. There is a very brief recap of previous events in the first few pages but you may want to go back to get a better idea of what's happened. Not essential because of the recap but why not delve a little further into Dexter's world given the chance?

"I buy this on a regular basis and find it works very well at moisturizing especially during cold and dry weather. This has basically no scent which I like. It goes on somewhat creamy and you will feel a bit of a coating afterwards. But I find there's no way around that if you want something that is hydrating and protecting your skin from cold dry air. I wish it had absolute 'transparency' after it is applied but don't see how that's possible and it probably wouldn't work as well as it did. Overall I recommend this for someone who wants a no scent good moisturizer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HD924FU18VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFR14ZU#wasThisHelpful","R36HD924FU18VF","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic! This is one of the best collections of Basquiat paintings available. I was able to see the exhibition this book is based on and the selection of artworks was worthy of a museum showing. This book is beautifully printed in a large 10x12 inch format in full color with a sturdy hardcover binding. Whether you already have a number of Basquiat books or this is your first one this is a must-have and highly recommended. Of the Basquiat books currently in print this is easily the best one available.

"Good for golf. I use this to measure closest to the hole distances. I used to use a metal measure but after a while the water on the grass from early mornings starts to rust the metal and eventually it doesn't roll in and out so good.

"When the lashes arrived I was pleased with the entire presentation. I love that they come in their own compact. Whenever I've worn false lashes in the past it's always come in a rinky dink packaging which never gave proper storage to reuse. The Georgie set treat the lashes as the delicate precious little lashes they are. This is one instance where packaging is actually important to the product. I like the little how to on the inside pamphlet, it's instructive an actually very encouraging. I like the line: ""Take your time when learning to apply. You'll catch on in no time."" And they are right, it's not that easy when you first try as with any faux lash, but once you get the hang of it, it's super fun and my new favorite party accessory. I've only worn them twice but I feel like they are going to last a good while longer. They seem to be well made and the glue is non irritant and vegan so I don't worry like I might with other products about eye infection.I would definitely recommend these lashes for anyone looking for an extra spruce to their party look. The presentation is so lovely I would even say they are worthy of a gift for a stylish girlfriend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YBX9XF8SM0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00819RNNY#wasThisHelpful","R31YBX9XF8SM0L","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you haven't read any other reviews then don't! Many reviews mention right up front how the book starts and personally I would have found that to be a bit of a spoiler. It's fun to read and experience yourself how a book starts versus someone stating in a sentence what happens. Because this book is so well written it's hard not to want to tell everyone what's going to happen. For an advance review I can safely say this book looks at the idea of humans traveling and living in space. Is it possible? What problems might come up? How would people change and adapt to their new environment? That's just the beginning of this long book which never gets boring. There's enough detail to make the world and characters come alive and enough action to keep the story moving. Read the first three pages.You're either hooked and if not this book is probably not for you. I couldn't stop reading this and while early in the year this could end up on some sci-fi top ten lists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEG61PPZ2OPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190377#wasThisHelpful","R3EEG61PPZ2OPR","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good, basic fried rice using soy sauce as the main base of the recipe. It has chicken, eggs, onion, mushroom, peppers, peas and carrots sprinkled throughout. Compared to home made or restaurant fried rice this one is much more mushy since it only comes to life after being soaked in water. The textures in the rice and chicken are not the same as home made but I expect that in freeze dried meals. The more important issue is the taste and this is fine. For dietary concerns this one is higher in cholesterol at 100mg/33% DV and sodium at 600mg/25% DV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHPA8AX2N4GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJM2HTE#wasThisHelpful","RPHPA8AX2N4GK","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried quite a few Mountain House meals and this is one of the better ones. It's a tomato based sauce with rice, beef, and some peppers. I've found that the best tasting meals are the tomato sauce ones. This has a mild but pleasant flavor. The beef is ok but has mushy texture which is consistent with all the other beef freeze dried meals I've tasted. Some of the Mountain House meals can be a bit of a shock when you look at the nutrition facts but this one is quite reasonable. The only percentage that might be high for some people is the sodium at 590mg per serving (25% DV).

"The Book of Speculation introduces to the story's hero, Simon Watson, who finds a package on his doorstep. In it is an old book with his grandmother's name written in it. A note explains the book was bought by a book dealer who is sending it to Simon as it may be of interest to him and his family. The second chapter flashes back to the 1780's and the character Amos who is mute, finds his way into a traveling circus because of his ability to seemingly disappear. In chapter three Simon, who happens to be a librarian, talks with the bookseller who sent him the book and finds this is something he has done before. Simon is not really interested in the book as it brings up bad family memories of his deceased parents. Later while at the library he notices the book is a diary and account book for a traveling show, Peabody's Portable Magic and Miracles--the same show from chapter two.There are other interesting details and connections and the story goes on from there. Simon is a bit of a straight and narrow character, perhaps too much so for my taste. But I like books about the history of books and time travel so enjoyed reading this. It's okay, not great, but if you like the setting of this book you might enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33DEC49TO06K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125005480X#wasThisHelpful","R33DEC49TO06K","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Mountain House Breakfast Skillet freeze dried meal in the new ""urban"" package design. I generally like most of the Mountain House offerings and this one was no exception. The big caveat for those who have not tried freeze dried meals is that they tend to have different textures than regular cooked food. Meats especially. And in this case eggs. The eggs are a bit mushy in texture and overall it's a big mush. But the flavor on this one is pretty good for freeze dried. A good tip with this dish is to eat it with soft tortillas and make a breakfast burrito. I like this breakfast meal better than their scrambled eggs and bacon. A warning to those with diet concerns. A single pack contains 31g total fat (48% of DV), 9g saturated fat (45% DV), 310mg cholesterol (103% DV), 1170mg sodium (49% DV).

I keep freeze dried meals for just-in-case scenarios but end up eating one every few months. Freeze dried eggs are the most challenging of the Mountain House foods but I would eat them. My favorite is their lasagna. Compared to other brands if you want eggs Mountain House does the best. Their Eggs & Bacon will do the trick when needed but if you're at home just make some fresh eggs.

"Aurora takes us aboard the first multigenerational starship currently 159 years into its voyage to the crew's new home, Aurora, in Tau Ceti. Because of the long journey to its final destination things have started to crack in this utopian Noah's ark. The ship itself is starting to show some wear and tear. But perhaps worse, the society is starting to show signs of discontent. What happens to a society confined to a small island? How can people evolve or devolve? Everyone on the chip is thought to be ""chipped"" so that every human is accounted for at all times. But not everyone wants to be on the grid and stay in their designated lands. Within the ship there may or may not be unaccounted for people known as Ferals. Are they purposely sabotaging the voyage? Added to this is a coming-of-age story with our heroine, Freya. She's tall, independent, and we follow her as she goes on a journey through all the different lands. This rite of passage is meant to show educate her about the different people but she discovers more than anticipated. This is the setup in the first few chapters but the book goes much further. Without giving any of the surprises away, I would say this is a book filled with details but covers broad strokes. If you've wondered what might happen if we sent people across space to settle a new planet (or moon) then this is an interesting ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVOLNM120BUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316098108#wasThisHelpful","R3PVOLNM120BUK","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the idea of a disposable cloth with the cleaning agent already inside. Simple and easy enough. They are thin pads loaded with cleaner that activates when exposed to water.The product is marketed as a kitchen cleaner but I think it works just fine in the bathroom as well.On the box there is a long list of surfaces the cleaner should not be used on ( marble, copper, aluminum or dark colored Corian surfaces)Unfortunately my kitchen is made up of quite a few of these surfaces that one should avoid using the product on. In the kitchen I am able to use the scrubs on the kitchen sink. It works quite well on the sink and it doesn't scratch it. I've used it in the bathroom to clean up some grout and tile and it works well there as well. The soapy residue the scrub leaves behind has to rinsed off but no big deal. The disposability of the scrub still makes it very convenient and easy to use.

"I have an old timey industrial style in my kitchen so I really welcomed the look off a non-electric squeeze press juicer. Be prepared to have enough counter space for this large gadget to sit. It's very big sturdy piece of equipment and not easy to take out and put away when you need it because it's got some serious weight to it.I like that it requires no electricity, so even though it takes a good amount of space the space itself is not dependent on how close it is placed to an outlet like so many of my other counter appliances and gadgets.The juicer functions pretty well. I pick up a large bag of oranges from my cousins backyard tree last week and have gotten to work each morning since making fresh juice.I've tried the potatoes once to make sliced fry pieces but they do take a little more strength to slice through.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a conversation piece juicer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PL468N4DZ180/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ47FFS#wasThisHelpful","R3PL468N4DZ180","A28I19Q54MYXGV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I19Q54MYXGV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, I'm not really sure how it is a parking tower.  It is a series of roads.  I guess you just park your car on the road and since it is only one lane wide, all other cars behind you are parked by default.Secondly, the first and second layers don't line up.  Anyone who is an engineer or knows geometry, knows that the same length line on an angle doesn't take up the same footprint as that line lying flat.  You have two sections that are on an angle to get from the 1st to the 2nd floor.  What we did to remedy this the best we could was to attach the red support sections to the top pieces only.  Instead of attaching to the first layer pieces, they just sit on them.  It is still sturdy enough, just not super sturdy.I (the adult) put on the stickers because once they are on, they aren't easily adjusted.  They went on easily and it wasn't hard to line them up correctly.So besides my adult perspective that it is poorly designed...from the child perspective, my 8-year-old loves it.

Then, you need to play it a couple of times to get the rules down.  To begin, you have only a partially built die to roll.  As you roll, you build on the die and play on the board at the same time.  If you roll a certain color on the die, you can block another player with lava.  Ultimately, you are trying to get to the top of the hill.We started playing with only 2 players.  Then we added a third person.  Much more strategy and fun with more players.Games weren't too short or too long.I really hesitated to buy this because many of the reviews said other Lego games were much better.

"Our family loves playing this game.  When I took it to a family game night, everyone wanted to play it because ""we have that in our house, but we never knew how to play it.""  I also felt like it was a good math and visual tool for my 7-year-old son.Now the reason it only got 3 stars is because the tiles are imperfect.  You put the tiles in a pile and mix them around, face down.  This causes the writing to not stay on well.  Seems like the company, knowing that this is part of the rules, should have designed it more robust.  Secondly, some of the tiles are not flat on the back.  There are imperfections that once you have played the game a couple of times, you can cheat by knowing what numbers are on those marked tiles.I would definitely recommend the game, but find a higher quality set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QECNSR6R6RIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006667N#wasThisHelpful","R2QECNSR6R6RIO","A3KWAN5J031OOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KWAN5J031OOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It introduces a Bible concept by telling a real story from their lives.  It gives a way to practice that in your life.  Then, it has a small prayer.  It is at my child's level (7-year-old boy).  He watched Duck Commander with us, so because he recognized the Duck Commander name, he was excited to read this book.No matter what your feelings on Duck Commander, this is a good devotion for kids.

"THE SHORT STORY:  VERY quickly became my favorite mouse. Easy to program, smooth adjustable use. And very cool LED lighting effects.ADDED SEPT 10 2015: After using this mouse for a while, I love it so much, I'm buying another one!  I've been using computers since 1977 and using computer mice since the mid 80's and this is, by far, without a doubt, my favorite mouse of all time. I use it for my work, which is a combination of writing/editing text, creating 3D images with graphic software, online communication and accessing stuff on the web ... and this mouse saves me so much time and effort and makes my work so much easier and more comfortable that I am buying another one so I can have one in both my offices. I currently have the extra buttons programmed to do BROWSER FWD, BROWSER BACK, ARROW LEFT, ARROW RIGHT, ALT-S (SAVE), CTRL-W (CLOSE BROWSER TAB) and WIN+L (LOCK PC) and my hand spends so much more time on the mouse now without the need to flit back and forth between mouse and keyboard, it's amazing.

"We bought this fan to go in our small bedroom window to blow outdoor air into the bedroom and to provide a little white noise for easier sleeping. We've been running it for about a month now and we're very happy with it. It runs quietly but with a soft hum that is soothing to help induce sleep. It runs all day and night in the window and is free of vibrations or movement, sitting nicely on its feet and not moving from where we placed it. And yet, when I want to take it down from the window to switch it on or off, it's very light weight to pick up and move. The cord reaches easily from the window to the nearest available outlet without stretching. And the two speeds are adequate for our needs.PROS: Quiet, no vibration, moves air well, light weight, easy to change speeds, reasonable length cord.CONS: None so far.

"THE BOTTOM LINE:  A VERY pleasant surprise ... a high quality product that fits well, stays in place and quickly became a new favorite. And it's leather. :)THE REST OF THE STORY:  I've been thinking about buying a new belt pouch / fanny pack for a while now, and when I saw this item on Amazon I was really surprised as I'd not seen one quite like it before. Most of the packs I've had in the past or seen online were ballistic nylon and not very stylish. This item is was made of leather and suited my personal tastes very well. I was really excited to try it out but feared that it would be too small to fit my 44"" waist (as many belt pouches I've tried in the past were too small).When this Pack Belt arrived, I delayed trying it on to avoid the seemingly inevitable disappointment of learning that it was too small. But when my wife told me she wanted to go on a 4 mile hike, I thought it sounded like a great opportunity to give the Pack Belt a good work out. Imagine my delight when I tried it on and found that it not only fit, but with several belt holes to spare. My wife and I made our 4 mile walk in a nature preserve the following day and I put my wallet, keys and a few other items in the Pack Belt, strapped it on and headed out. Three and a half hours later, I was completely pleased with how the Pack Belt had fit and how it wore while I was walking. No discomfort, no slipping and the easy in-and-out magnetic closure pouch flaps let me get in and out of the three main compartments with ease. Behind the flapped pouches is a zipper pouch that runs the length of the pouch with plenty of room for a small Moleskine notebook and Flair pen I brought a long (and I easily could have fit more stuff inside).My wife also found the Pack Belt much more stylish than various belt pouches I've owned in the past and was really glad I'd decided to give this one a try.My take on this Pack Belt?Style - 5 starsConstruction - leather, well put together, easy to use zipper and magnetic closures, sturdy - 5 starsFit - snug, comfortable, no moving about or discomfort - 5 starsSizing - fit me at 44"" very well, and room to spare if I'm wearing more layers.Hardware - brass colored metal (not sure what the composition of the metal is)CONS:  None that I've encountered so far.

"I generally LOVE Moleskine notebooks (5), and have many in different sizes and colors. I use them a lot and love their practicality, durability and excellent writing surface. The pocket in the back, book mark ribbon and elastic close strap are all features I really appreciate, use and find hold up over long term use.  And with regard to these features I love, this violet notebook is as good as my other Moleskine's. So I would have agreed before today with the notion that ""you can't go wrong with Moleskine"" ... but I learned this morning that indeed you can, especially with this VIOLET pocket journal. I purchased mine in a brick and mortar store, still in the original packaging, and yet when I opened it I saw that it was badly faded (store fluorescent lights?). Everywhere the cover wasn't protected by the label or the elastic strap, the color had a distinct, unattractive reddish hue, and where it was protected, the original color remained. I've purchased other colors from stores (red, black, green, even violet in smaller formats) and didn't see this fading effect. The quality of the book as a writing surface and pocket pad seems fine, but Moleskine's quality track record with me is no longer 100%. I know this fading issue can be corrected on Moleskine's end by adding UV protection to the dyes they use for the cover ink, I just hope they do the right thing and make the required adjustment to their formulations. I plan to add stickers to the front of this one to distract from the fade pattern. A NOTE TO AMAZON BUYERS: If you're ordering your Violet pocket journal from Amazon and not buying it in a store, I suspect there's a good chance it will not have been exposed to a lot of UV, so it might arrive without this fading issue. But, if like me, you work all day under fluorescent's or the sun, the cover color might fade over time during use. If that doesn't matter to you, the rest of the features of this notebook should be true to form for Moleskine classic pocket journals.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R229KXR8YX5RV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8866136425#wasThisHelpful","R229KXR8YX5RV4","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Replacement Li batteries can be tricky, with some after market batteries not even fitting properly in the devices for which they are ""recommended"". This battery by Canon was a perfect fit for my camera after the old battery began swelling from age and exposure and worked properly after the first charging. The clearances on the battery compartment on my Canon pocket camera are VERY tight, and when the old batter swelled a bit, it was difficult to even get it out of the camera. Fortunately, it hadn't leaked, and we were able to salvage the camera, if not the battery. Having had bad luck in the pass with aftermarket batteries, I decided to stick with the manufacturer's brand and I'm very glad I did. We've had this battery in use for a few months now and it's working perfectly.I'll update this review in the future should anything change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGMDE0CKFD7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032JRRZM#wasThisHelpful","R2NGMDE0CKFD7S","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not so many years ago, we were rookie ""painted planet parents ... our daughter had only started elementary school and we foolishly thought that any Styrofoam ball would do as a base for painting a mocked up planet, or perhaps a cut-away cell. Well, like many before us, we learned the hard way, Styrofoam balls are NOT created equal. While THIS product has a very smooth, easy to paint surface, many are more rough, rugged, even scratchy and very porous, absorbing paint very unevenly. This particular model took to the satin finished spray paint specified for Uranus like a pro and was orbiting between Saturn and Neptune in no time, after a quick detour over our picnic table. :)How do you hold the sphere while painting and drying? We used a small metal cooking skewer through the North Pole (sorry Santa) and we were in business very quickly, able to hold the skewer while painting and then suspend the planet from the skewer for extended drying/curing from the ceiling of our back porch. The skewer stayed secure in the ball with no problems at all.We also enjoyed particularly ordering this product from Amazon and not having to run all over town to half a dozen craft or art supply/discount stores trying to find the right size, texture and surface of Styrofoam ball (as we had in the past). We just searched Amazon, found the right size, read the reviews, ordered the one that sounded best from a Prime supplier, and it was delivered to our door in just a couple of days.

"We tried making an ice ball / Death Star with this ""sphere maker"" and had mixed feelings about the results. Did it make an ice ball? Yes?  Did it look like the Death Star? Kind of, maybe after a bad day in space. Was it easy to use?  No, not really.But, I think whether or not you'll like this product really depends on what your looking for:Quick/Easy/Reliable way to create crisp looking ice ball Death Stars - 2 to 3 stars> Why? It's not at all easy to get the correct filling / cooling / finishing process down just right to quickly and easily and predictably produce a really nice ice death star. It takes lots of trial and error and mixed results to eventually get one that turns out pretty good. So if you're looking for a mold that will be a predictable maker of impressive ice spheres, plan on putting in a lot of R&D work to get the process just right. Quick and easy ... not so much.Chocolate Death Star Maker ... maybe much higher stars.> Why?  From what I've read ... this mold reportedly works VERY well with chocolate. So read other reviews by folks who made chocolate spheres with it and see if that's what you're looking for. It sounds like quite a few folks here who've used this mold to make chocolates were very pleased with the results. I was surprised with how consistently they reported results that were fairly trouble free, consistent and pleasing. Not at all like our results with water/ice.So ... think about what you want to use this product for first ... read a few reviews by chocolateers ... and then decide.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RS9GNZXGEN4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEEGC8S#wasThisHelpful","R1RS9GNZXGEN4J","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SHORT VERSION (SEE SEPT 2ND 2015 UPDATE BELOW)So far, I have no complaints with this product. Like others, I assumed this was safe for all lenses, as advertised, and was surprised to find that it might not be (based thus far on the claims of others and the smell of ammonia).  But, thus far, my lenses are fine. For more details, read on.THE LONG VERSIONUPDATE - SEPTEMBER 2ND - 2015Still no complaints. I turned skeptical after reading so many negative reviews, but I really have had nothing but good results with this product. I'm upping my rating from 4 stars to 5 starts after a few months of enjoyable, trouble free use. No smearing, no film, quick cleaning, GREAT spray control, and no impact on my lens coatings at all.ORIGINAL REVIEWI ordered this product trusting in the Zeiss name, and never even thought that this product might not be what it claims. When I read some of the reviews that suggested it wasn't what it seemed to be, I felt like a fool for not reading the reviews before I ordered ... I WRITE reviews, why didn't I read them? Too much faith in a brand I've known or years ... or what claimed to be.BUT ... the glasses I'm wearing now are getting old and will need to be replaced soon. What a great opportunity to experiment!  If this stuff is not what it claims and my lenses lose their coatings, no big deal. I'm due for new ones soon. And if not, then I'll have demonstrated that, at least for my glasses (tri-focal no-lines with coatings) it worked well. What have I found?1) I've been using this product on my glasses several times a week for about a month, and so far I can only say good things.2) The spray nozzle on the top of each bottle distributes the spray better than any other lens cleaning bottle I've ever used (and I've been wearing glasses since about 1970).  It seems a minor thing, but it really helps speed the process of cleaning my glasses to know the pump mister works so well, every time. I distributes spray only where I want it, and I've never been able to say that before.3) The spray mist adheres well to the lenses and the action with a proper tissue/cloth on the lens is very smooth and effective. No smearing, sticking or jumping like with some cheaper cleaners. I have no issues during the cleaning process itself at all.4) The removal of skin oils and other greasier forms of dirt from the lenses is quick and easy. I've experienced no film or smearing at all.I'm a little surprised ... still a little skeptical ... but so far, so good.NOTE:I will report my results again after another month or so of daily use and let you know if the coatings on my lenses are still holding up to daily cleaning with this product or not. So far, I see no signs of the coatings breaking down (and I have experienced that on previous glasses when improperly cleaned, so I know what to look for).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSE651MT9AZZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPVQVCO#wasThisHelpful","RSE651MT9AZZ3","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But, since the product was to be provided for free in exchange for an honest review, I thought I'd take a chance and give it a try. I had extra motivation too. My stepdaughter suffers from nosebleeds when the air is dry, and she LOVES anything that provides mood lighting. She's also fond of Lavender oil fragrance. This one item might provide her with a delightful gift ... if she liked it.Well, the item arrived the other day to huge sighs of delight. We opened it up (easy to open packaging, product was safe and sound, no damage), read the instructions (the English is a little rough in places, but totally thorough and understandable), added water with Lavender oil, selected the light setting with the easy to use nicely hidden buttons, and in no time my daughter was in 7th heaven. The item itself is very attractive and seems solidly and very well made. The wooden part is very attractive and the glass top adds a very elegant touch. The product is very quiet and provides different options for choosing a single light color or a rotating light pattern.  She's been using it every night as a combination humidifier / fragrance oil mister / night light and is very pleased.We'll report back in a few weeks with more information on how it's holding up over time, any issues that arise, and our overall satisfaction over time.

"My daughter's Galaxy S3 developed ""complications"" with the usb charge port (it wouldn't), and so we started looking into alternative means of charging her phone. This charger got consistently good reviews and I liked the simple design based on a USB charging cable (no separate AC adapter to schlep around), so we ordered it and she's been using it for about a week now. While we haven't measured the total charge time from drained, she leaves it on the charger overnight and its ready to go in the morning when she gets up. She brings it with her when she's staying over with relatives and its seems to work fine everywhere she's been. It's a little tricky to use this kind of charger in the car if you're on twisting road as the phone will tend to slide off the charger, but if you can hold it in your lap, it seems to charge just fine.The charging unit (the black square in the lower right of the picture) is small and easy to take with you on outings and my 12 year old had no problems installing the battery charge receiver (the part that goes inside the back of the phone) by herself.Simple, affordable, well designed, effective ... MY kind of product.  We're very happy with the results and will update this review if anything changes.NOTABLES> Charges with a USB cable, allowing for charging from PC, car charger or wall charger, depending on what you have.> Battery charge receiver unit (goes inside phone) is easy to install and does not make the phone any thicker.> Works best when lying flat, does not work very well if charging platform is placed at an angle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXHZ6IGGDLW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DS34MO6#wasThisHelpful","RDXHZ6IGGDLW9","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I initially enjoyed this polygonal dice app as a fun addition to my gaming tool kit, the most recent AT&T upgrade of my Galaxy S5 (spring 2015) seems to have rendered it partially neutered. Gone are changeable dice colors or any other settings aside from table surface selection and dice count. I can't find any help text either. The action of the dice also changed after the AT&T update, with the ""bounciness"" of the dice now considerably increased. While the app is still usable, it's not as configurable as it was before.

Here are the pro's and con's as I see them.PRO'S- Arrived in perfect condition, no damage- Easy to open packaging, product removes easily from box.- No assembly required, just slide it into place and you're in business.- Light weight, easy to move around and open/close.- Opens and closes reliably on what seem to be good hinges.- White fabric backing reflects light into my cube, which is nice.- Very nice finish on the wood frame.CON'S- VERY light weight ... so don't consider it for applications where it might easily get knocked over by high volume or random traffic (little kids, cats, etc)- Fabric ""glued"" to back of lattice work, so not able to slide things between lattice and fabric to add decorative elements without breaking bond between fabric and lattice.- Fabric very delicate and looks like it would be easy to damage if you weren't being careful.So, for uses where you can be careful to use this screen lightly, like my low traffic office, I think it's perfect. For applications requiring a tougher, more durable design, this might be too fragile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VU6Q9VOOEIZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WGJHB8#wasThisHelpful","R2VU6Q9VOOEIZD","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For starters, these are not fancy book cases, nor did I expect them to be. I was looking for simple, effective, attractive, well made book cases to augment the storage at my desk at work.  These had good reviews, the price seemed fair, and so I ordered 2 and had them shipped to my office. The short form of my review ... I love them. :)  Now for the rest of the story, if you care to get the details.PACKAGINGThe packaging was VERY robust, with good solid cardboard cases used, but with extra corner reinforcing pads added to the outside of each edge of the shipping case. I've not seen these before. It's a self-adhesive corner pad that runs along the edge of the case and provides extra protection against edge crushing. They seem to work really well and are easy to remove by simply pulling them off. Great idea!PRODUCT QUALITY AND CONDITIONThe parts for the book cases inside were packed identically, which made opening and retrieving the parts easy and predictable. All the parts inside were in good to excellent condition, with only one corner damaged across 2 book cases, and that was not during shipping as the packaging in that area was flawless, so it must have happened during manufacturing or loading into the box. The damage was very minor, and I don't consider it an issue. The color of the material is very pleasing to the eye and the texture feels very nice to touch.  The only oddness in the contents of the boxes was that the first case I opened had exactly the number of fasteners I needed to assemble the book case, while the second had quite a few extras.ASSEMBLYI've built quite a few book cases in my lifetime, and these were as easy to assemble as any I've built.  The instructions were correct and complete if you need them, but I personally found they weren't necessary as the assembly is rather simple.  The only tool I used was my Swiss Army Knife to screw in the Phillips head screws.  If you plan to nail on the faux-wood-finish cardboard back panel, you'll need a hammer, but I preferred these open backed, so no hammering was required. All the parts went together easily without forcing, fit properly and felt solid and square when I was done. I did each one, alone, in my tiny cubicle with no problems.SHELVESSmall metal pegs fit into holes in the side panels, onto which clear rubber tips slide over the end to protect the shelves from damage rubbing against the metal pegs. Nice touch. The shelves fit perfectly first time, no issues.CONSAside from one tiny bit of superficial manufacturing damage to one corner of one book case, I'm 100% satisfied with these book cases. They made quite a nice addition to my cube.  One of the bosses swung by at one point and commented that my cube was beginning to look more like an office.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2200425OKW719/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AT8X9C#wasThisHelpful","R2200425OKW719","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often find myself looking for creative solutions to ""how to turn this on and off more easily"" and I must say this Lighted Foot Switch with 9ft 3 Outlet Cord is one of the best I've come across. I have two devices at my desk at work that I only use ""sometimes"", and both are located UNDER my desk, not easy for me to get to, in terms of reaching the individual power on/off switches of each device when I want to activate or de-activate.  Both devices are black with black cords, are neither is easy to reach from my desk chair. What I wanted was a cord with a foot switch on it that I could simply move my foot to turn on and off with no hassle. This product solved my problem perfectly.PRO'S1) Plenty long enough (nine feet) to maneuver around under my desk without difficulty or tripping/kicking hazard. Shorter cords cut across the area where my feet move and snag, this one does not.2) TWO lights ... one stays on to let you know the cord is plugged into a live circuit, the 2nd light comes on only when you have the switch engaged to ON. Great design!3) Three outlets - more than enough for my needs at the moment so I don't need to worry about getting multiple cords.4) Foot switch works easily and predictably, without having to ""retry"" to turn things on and off.5) White color ... so I can find it easily under my dark desk when I need to rearrange things. Black cords in a dark area ... not handy.CONSNone that I've encountered so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TLS0GEK00N7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NCDUKY#wasThisHelpful","R3TLS0GEK00N7U","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This honest review provided in exchange for a free sample of the product.Wow ... :)  What a delightful surprise.THE SHORT FORM (UPDATED IN JUNE 2015)This courier bag quickly became my favorite of several I own, and I get a surprising number of compliments on it while enjoying using it. Several people have asked where I got it and expressed interest in getting one like it. And I don't blame them. It's really a wonderful bag.THE REST OF THE STORYI have been a long time user of various sorts of personal bags, from satchels and brief cases to back packs and courier bags, starting in ... yes, revealing my true geek/nerd nature ... 3rd grade. My first was was red plaid vinyl.  Yeah ... it was 1970. I've owned all kinds of bags from cheapo's to Tumi's and put them through their paces, and enjoyed exploring the range of what a personal bag can be.  Personal bags are one of those items I don't just use, I enjoy using them. A good bag becomes a good friend.Most recently I've been using a nylon courier bag for my laptop, and while it works well for that purpose (light weight, sturdy, good fit), it's not much to look at and has little room for my papers and non-electronic items. I had begun thinking about (though not actively looking for yet) getting something nicer to keep my papers in, when I got the chance to review this DesertWolf Cotton Canvas Crazy-horse Leather bag.I'm rather demanding about bags, and so I accepted the offer with a considerable sense of ""I'll probably be disappointed"".  For me to LOVE a bag, (I'd give my laptop courier about 3 stars) the features and fittings need to be both very well thought out with regard to how people will actually use them and very well executed so that the bag actually delivers on the day to day execution of the design concepts.  When I opened the box for this bag, my eyes opened wide.  This looks NICE.Then I touched the bag.  The canvas and leather both feel amazing ... thick and sturdy yet surprisingly soft and supple.  NOT a common combination in my experience. And the lining inside the bag ... yes, I said lining ... soft, durable, classy.I couldn't believe it. I got this bag as a free sample?  What a lucky duck!  I kept looking over the bag in more detail, waiting for it to reveal its weaknesses.  Poor hardware?  Nope. Solid and cool.  Flimsy shoulder strap?  Nope ... again, sturdy but soft and pleasant to touch.  Painful handle when gripped with weight?  Nope, soft, satisfying, comfortable.The ONLY thing I'd caution potential buyers on is the size.  This is not a big bag. Check the dimensions to make sure it's a size that works for you. For me, looking to carry my 8.5x11 papers and files and such, it's perfect. The interior pockets (most open top for writing instruments, cell, etc. and  one zip close for cell phone or change perhaps) are great. The magnetic closures on the front are quick and easy to use (thanks for adding all the great pictures) and stay firmly closed (I've not had them pop open once by accident).If you're looking to carry a smaller laptop inside, there is an elastic strap to keep it secure in a dedicated pocket for laptops and the Velcro closure on the elastic strap has a good grip and sports a nice leather tab.  I just a couple of notebooks (paper) in the laptop pocket as my computer is a monster that has its own zip code and requires a bigger bag.As noted by others, the look of this bag is intentionally just a bit worn when it comes to the leather, but the effect is a pleasing patina, not at all beat up looking.  The canvas is in great shape and has a charcoal gray color I really like.This really is a very classy, stylish looking bag with exceptionally good design and high quality materials that look and feel great yet seem extremely durable ... this bag has become an instant favorite of mine.  I told my wife tonight ""This is my writers bag"" ... not a distinction I award easily. :)Is there ANYTHING about this bag I didn't like?  Not so far. If that changes, I'll be sure to report back with a follow up. But after a couple of weeks of pretty much daily use, I'm hooked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1WZEFWPC31O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5HF8BI#wasThisHelpful","RS1WZEFWPC31O","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This honest review is provided in exchange for a sample of the product provided at no cost ... but there's more to the story :)I received the PS4 Vertical Stand Cooler with Fan and was a bit disappointed to learn that the unit was for a piece of electronics I don't own ... a PS4.  I'd skimmed the initial email a bit too quickly and didn't realize the unit was dedicated to one particular unit, the PS4.What to do?!I wheeled myself into the aisle at work and asked ""Anyone here have a PS 4?"" Three heads popped out from behind cubical walls. I work with a group of system engineers who LOVE their games.  After some debate as to which of the three would get to give the product a try (and keep it, if they liked it) in exchange for feedback on the item, it was greed that ""Agent X"" as we'll call him, had popped his head out into the aisle fastest, and would therefore get the opportunity to bring the product home, check it out and report back his findings. I should reiterate that Agent X is a systems engineer and a very serious gamer, and thus rather picky about his gaming hardware. I was a bit nervous that he'd come back saying it just didn't measure up to his standards.Well, the reports are back from the gaming front lines and here's what Agent X had to say about the IBSound PS4 Vertical Stand Cooler with Fan (These are direct quotes, delivered a few days apart, the first after just a couple days use, the second a few days later):""Ive been using (the IBSoudn PS4 Vertical Stand Cooler with Fan) and the fans are really quiet and it holds the controllers nicely as well.""A few days later ...""Here are a few more thoughts:- The ps4 feels sturdy in the stand. I'm not worried about it falling over again (it had fallen over before Agent X began using the stand).- The cooling is nice, will be way nicer in summer!- The extra USB ports are great for charging multiple peripherals at the same time.Overall, it seems to do everything it advertises quite well!""So, there you have it, from a serious gamer and systems engineer who loves putting systems through their paces.  I will be sure to report back if Agent X has any additional comments, pro or con, in the weeks ahead.And as a final bit of testimonial ... yes, he decided to keep it. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZEQXVBKFNCAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSD1ZBQ#wasThisHelpful","RZEQXVBKFNCAU","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE - SEPT 2015 - AFTER 5 MONTHS USEI use this charging unit several times a week and have done so since I received it in mid April of 2015. In that time, I've had absolutely no problems with this unit. It has functioned as expected, charging my Galaxy S5 quickly and without issues, staying nicely lodged in the adapter in my car and presenting no difficulties whatsoever. I'm puzzled by the ""lots of 5 stars, lots of 1 stars"" pattern to the reviews for this item, but all I can do is report that, thus far, I've got five months use from mine with no issues.ORIGINAL REVIEW - INITIAL INDICATIONSI got this unit for two reasons ... to support multi-phone charging and to deliver enough amps to actually charge a phone/phones while the phones are in use, not just hold the charge level steady while the phones are in use. The old chargers I've had for my Galaxy S5 were able to supply only enough current that, when I was using the phone for map following while driving, the charge level would hold just about even, never gaining more than 1% or 2% charge in as long as an hour or two of driving. If the phone was off, the battery would charge a bit.This Omaker charger supplies much greater power and even while the phone is in use, the battery charge builds steadily. We haven't used it in ""multi-phone"" mode yet, but once we have, I'll supply information on performance.Other Notes - The unit plugs easily into our cigarette lighter socket (not all the units we've had in the past did), the blue status light makes it easy to find in low light and the USB connection ports work well.So far, 100% satisfied with this unit and it is clearly the best I've had so far, much better than any of the others I've tried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HOTORC8ZJ5BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ5OIFE#wasThisHelpful","R3HOTORC8ZJ5BR","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was recently given the opportunity to try out the IBSound Casual Style Polka Dots Canvas Laptop Backpack (CSPDCLB - black) in exchange for an honest review of the product. As our family is rather bonkers over backpacks as a way to carry our stuff from here to there (school, work, day trips, mini-breaks, weekenders, sleepovers, etc.), I jumped at the chance, and offered to my 12 year old step-daughter the opportunity of being the test subject for this product, which she agreed to immediately. After using it for a week or so, she came into my room and said ""Five Stars ... I love it.""  And her use of the pack proves that. :)AFTER ONE WEEK'S USEWe discussed her experience of the pack thus far and here's what she had to say (paraphrased, of course):SIZE AND LAPTOP CARRYINGMy step-daughter has a 15"" Dell laptop PC.  While her PC won't fit in this pack's designated laptop compartment (which is designed only for 14"" laptops) the pack's main compartment is comfortably big enough to hold her 15"" Dell laptop and my step-daughter uses it this way and says it works very well. She can use the intended laptop compartment for papers, large format books, notebooks, etc.  She likes the overall capacity of the pack and feels comfortable stuffing it full of things, including her coat when she doesn't need to wear it.POCKETS & COMPARTMENTSWhen asked if she felt the pack had a good number and mix of pocket types (see other reviews for photos of same) my step-daughter said she was very happy with the offering of ""places to put things"" in the CSPDCLB. She found the zippers to be easy to spot (white tabs on black canvas ... a darned good idea, and I wish more pack makers took more thought to make zipper tabs stand out against the fabric for easy location) and smooth to use.CONSTRUCTIONDespite the fact that the backpack is very light-weight, it's made from a tough canvas that feels very substantial. The build of the pack in general feels sturdy.  The shoulder straps are nicely padded and my step-daughter said it was comfortable to carry, even when fully loaded.AFTER LONGER TERM USEI'll report back in a few months (when the pack has had some daily wear) to report on how it's held up to daily use to-and-from my step-daughter's school ... strap endurance, zipper function, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31763WILMYIQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSXUHBA#wasThisHelpful","R31763WILMYIQQ","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But when I try to order in other than muted colors (black, gray, very dark green, etc.), they're always out of stock in my size. Well, I'll keep trying as I really love how these shirts wear.

"PHASE 1 - OPENING, INSPECTING, ADJUSTING, INDOOR TESTING:I was very excited to find a pair of walking poles for what felt like such a reasonable price and with such consistently great reviews.  I found the package easy to open, the product within in perfect condition and the instructions on adjustment and use easy to find and well written.  I adjusted the poles to varying heights (shared by family of differing heights) and got a feel for the locking mechanism easily even without using the well written instructions which do cover how this is done. The spring inside the pole does seem suitable for adding some shock absorbing capability. Comes with 4 rubber caps for the metal tip along with cups for preventing the poles from sinking into soft soil when being used.PHASE 2 - In UseI took these poles out for a long walk on a nature trail recently and I really liked how they handled. They supported me well, were easy to extend and lock into walking position and just as easy to unlock and collapse back into storage position. The rubber tips on the poles provided good ""footing"" on both gravel and wooden walking surfaces (a board walk, in this case) and were just as tightly secured to the ends of the poles at the end of our walk as at the beginning. The wrist straps were handy and never got in the way.I've seen some questions raised about how the poles support the full weight of the person using them, and thus far I've had no issues with this at all. I'll keep you posted as more uses of these poles provide more insight into their durability, usability, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FX3JARCB9V9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YT854S#wasThisHelpful","R34FX3JARCB9V9","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE OCTOBER 2015This pen has developed a major problem with the ink magazine leaking HUGE drops of ink onto the page. I'm not sure what the problem is. I'm using the same brand of ink that I started with and now every time I try to write, the pen  drops a large drop of ink on the paper. I'll try cleaning it and replacing the ink to see if the problem goes away, but this certainly won't do. I've been using fountain pens for over 40 years and I've never seen one do this before.UPDATE JULY 2015I have been using this pen for several months now, and while I still find it a gorgeous pen to write with, I am encountering difficulties with ink changes. The first cartridge went through the pen just fine, but when I changed to another Waterman ink cartridge (same brand and color as the first one I used), it took a VERY long time for the ink to work its way through to the tip and begin writing normally. How long? Imagine writing 200 words and still seeing only faded color coming through the tip. I've gone through this twice now and I can't say any other fountain pen I've used (and I've had about 20 over the years) displayed this behavior. In other words, if I were to take my Waterman Phileas, my Lamy fountain pen and this pen, wash them all in cool water, and load them with new cartridges, the other two pens would be writing fine very quickly. This pen seems to take days after an ink change for the normal flow of ink to return to the tip. I will try a cartridge of Lamy ink next and see if that helps. Downgrading my review to LIKE ... ink changes are a big part of life with fountain pens, and they should be quick and easy. This one ... not so far. Mystery not solved.There are pens ... and then there are pens. :)  Wow ... this one is just amazing.SHORT STORYMUCH more than I would have reason to hope for given the price. I frankly would be surprised to find this pen, in this form, available for it's original listed price of $100, but to get it for the current price is just amazing.  The photos from the seller don't do it justice, so I've added my own.  Very beautiful, very high quality and writes like a dream.  Excellent, all the way around.  Whether or not it suits your style is another matter, but now you'll have enough information to choose wisely.LONG STORYI saw this pen listed as an item I might be interested in because I'd purchased the Lamy Al-Star (which I love).  I clicked on the link and was rather taken back by what I saw.  The low quality images and low price lead me to believe that this might be a low quality item. Then I read the reviews.  Didn't sound low quality to me.  For the price, it seemed a safe bet, so I gave it a try. WOW ... what a gorgeous find.PACKAGINGThe pen arrived safely in a lined and padded wooden box, protected by an outer cardboard box, protected by a bubble-wrap sleeve, packed inside a bubble-wrap envelope. Safe?  You bet.  And in 100% perfect condition. Packaging was all easy to open and in moments I was looking at my new pen.THE BOXI have paid considerably more for pens over the years, but I've never had one come in a box this nice. I'm not sure what the wood is, but it's got a lacquer finish and gold printing and a lining that's to die for.  A small catalog is included inside the box, and it's as classy as the rest.  To be totally fair, I might expect to pay the asking price for this whole item, box + pen ... just for the box.THE BODYWhen I picked up this pen, I immediately noted its weight. For some of you who complain about how light Lamy's and other modern fountain pens are, this one is no light weight. It feels very hefty in the hand. Beefy.  And yet the details on it (see photos) are incredibly fine and delicate (though not apparently fragile.  The pen arrives with the cap screwed onto the body in the closed position. The cap can also be screwed onto the back of the pen (see photos) for a longer writing instrument, the weight of the cap adding wonderfully to the balance of the pen while writing.THE NIBThe nib is gorgeous and works really well, putting down what I'd call a fine, smooth line of ink.  It took a few minutes for the ink to penetrate through to the writing tip of the nib, but after it did, smooth sailing.  Those who are nib geeks can probably tell you more about how and from what it's made, but I know it's gorgeous and works really well. Super smooth writing on both cream smooth journal pages or simple spiral bound notebook pages.THE DETAILSThe company says they strive to blend modern pen making technology with decoration inspired by traditional Chinese cultural icons.  I'm not expert on either, but my layman's impression is they scored big time.  One thing that struck me, aside from the detail of the ""sculpt"" of the dragon was the alignment.  Whether in the closed (cap over nib) or writing (cap on the back) positions, the eyes of the cap and body dragons line up perfectly ... not close ... not pretty good ... perfectly.  I can't remember the last time anything I bought lined up perfectly.  The attention to detail here is very visible. The quality of the characters on the cap is so crisp and clean.  Just delightful.WHO MIGHT NOT LIKE ITIf you're not into eastern cultural images or pens that feel weighty in your hand, this pen might not appeal to you. But I can say as someone who has traditionally purchased light weight fountain pens of either modern German or turn of the last century French design, I absolutely love this fountain pen, both as a collectible item and as a writing instrument.GAMER ALERTI am the game master (Dungeon Master) for an active D&D game, and this pen is sure to score points when I use it to make pertinent notes on the game in my Dragon Journal.  :)  I'm just sayin' ...PRICEI can't get over how ""beyond reasonable"" the price for this pen and box set is. Given the visual, tactile and writing qualities, I would expect to pay a lot more than this. If I was in any kind of shop that dealt in this kind of item and saw it in a display case, I'd be guessing on many times higher price tag. If this sounds like something that might be up your ally, treat yourself. You won't be disappointed, I'd venture to guess.INKTakes the same Waterman fountain pen cartridges I've been using for years with my Phileas fountain pens and writes wonderfully well using that ink. Also comes with a refillable mechanical cartridge (screw the piston down, dip into the ink reservoir, un-screw the piston back up to pull ink into the cartrdige, click into pen).The biggest fun, completely satisfying pen surprise I've experienced in years. :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVU4ZXNWCTA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00554BGKO#wasThisHelpful","RZVU4ZXNWCTA1","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many years ago, I purchased a small leather pad holder that took small notepads that gave you a 2""x3"" writing space, with another 3/8"" or so above that for binding (like this one, a staple).  The overall page size was 2"" x 3.375"", and the usable size was 2""x3"".

Someone noticed that, including the binding, it's almost 3"" long (2.9 to be more accurate) and has tried marketing it to US buyers as a 2""x3"" pad, which it is not in any sort of functional way. With .5875"" of paper unusable above the perforation, this is, in effect, a 2""x2.3125"" pad, with .5875"" of unusable binding.  To market it as a 2""x3"" pad is a misrepresentation, to say the least.  While I will use this pad, I will also be looking for a real 2""x3"" pad to replace it as soon as possible.The pad itself is made of high quality materials and I'm sure will work just fine for tiny notes, but the description should be changed to read ""Rhodia Classic Orange Notepad 2x2.3125.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P8BOH09NNI1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A65FGG#wasThisHelpful","R1P8BOH09NNI1S","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were able to make good ice spheres with this tray (5 stars), but it is a little tricky to get the water in the first few times (3 stars), until you get the hang of it. Once you understand what's going on with the water flow, you can pretty intuitively get the fill correct.  If the fill isn't correct, of course, the sphere inside won't be complete.  We like the final result, they're fun and as other reviewers have noted, don't interfere with drinking as much as cubes can. My step-daughter also pointed out that, unlike some soft ice cube trays we've tried, there was no funny after-taste with these (5 stars). Some of the soft trays we've tried before left the ice tasting chemically. That wasn't the case with these.  Overall, I give 4 stars and know we will use this tray again and again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRSNOX2M9S98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEF176O#wasThisHelpful","RWRSNOX2M9S98","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using Lamy fountain pains for many years and love them to death! :)  This is the first time I noticed violet as an available ink refill color (perhaps my oversight, not sure how long they've been available) but I HAD to try it out as purple is my main theme color.INSTALLATION - 5 stars, same as all other Lamy cartridges I've used before.  Push in firmly, wait for the SNAP as the ink tube penetrates the end of the cartridge, wait a few seconds.LINE QUALITY/FLOW - I give this ink 5 stars for flow and line quality ... it literally made a perfect line the first time the nib touched the paper ... NO skip at all, not even on the first stroke.  It continues to lay down really nice, consistent, smooth lines.COLOR/HUE - (personal preference) The shade of purple ink is very pleasing to my eye.  I'm not sure what international standard color system you use, so I can't give you an absolute reference, but I'd describe it as a strong, ""very slightly to the red"" side of purple ... it's definitely NOT a blueish purple (not the color of the petals on a violet flower) but neither is so red as to be called a magenta. Perhaps a mulberry?  Whether or not you will like it depends on your preferences, but I do like it. See attached photo sample. I should note that I feel the color compliments the hue of the Al-Star purple Lamy pen body.DRYING QUALITIES - the ink dries fast enough that I haven't had it smear on me yet in 2 days of heavy writing.  I should note that the hue/tone change slightly as the ink dries. It starts off a bit lighter tone and slightly redder hue and dries to the darker/bluer, ending up in a medium mulberry (see photo).TRANSLUCENT/OPAQUE - I'd describe this as a medium opaque ink. Some inks, when you look at droplets of them on a bright surface, you can't see any trace of light reflecting back through the ink droplet ... completely opaque. This ink allows some light reflection back through the ink. So if you want a seriously opaque purple ink, this might not work for you.  I would NOT describe this as a watery, or ""thin"" or overly transparent ink.  It puts down a line I like very much.I will update this review in the future if any new properties of this ink come to light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8T9NNV33PRZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00063NXGO#wasThisHelpful","R8T9NNV33PRZI","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a frequent reviewer on Amazon, I was offered a free sample of this product in exchange for an open and honest review ... that means if I don't like it, I'm expected to say so, and why, and I have dinged products in the past for shortcomings I felt the try had.THE SHORT FORMFive stars, love it, no complaints!THE REST OF THE STORYPACKAGING: The product arrived in tact, undamaged,  in easy to open packaging. SIZE/COLOR: I received the Blue model, and it appears as shown in the Amazon photos, dimensions check out. My step-daughter loved the color. START-UP: the unit arrived at least partially charged and fired up by pressing and holding the power-on button on the top, at which time a blue light displays and tones sound. ASSOCIATE TO DEVICE: On my Galaxy S5, I then went to Settings > Bluetooth and a) turned on my Bluetooth, b) allowed the device to be visible to other devices and c) hit scan.  The S5 quickly found the speaker. I then selected Call Audio and Media Audio. I did a quick test with a YouTube video and the speaker played and sounded very good. WATER TEST: I then gave the unit to my step-daughter who gave it five stars after using it (at 11 y.o., no instructions from me) for a long shower. She reports:A. Speaker stayed paired to her S3 at further range than Bluetooth speakers she's used beforeB. Suction cup worked very well in shower,  strong grip, no failureC. Great sound quality on music she played, no problems staying connectedD. Battery didn't run out after long showerE. Controls (play, pause, next, previous, switch to phone) worked easily and we'llF. Volume controlled by using phone volume controls (none on speaker)G. Waterproofing worked even when unit took direct spray.H. Loved size, shape, color.I. Recharges using USB cord that plugs with round jack into sealed port on speaker (open waterproof seal to charge)J.

"LAP GEAR SCHOOLHOUSE LAP DESK:  Reviews for this product ranged wildly before I purchased mine (about 80% pro, 20% con) and I was a bit cautious about ordering it.  Some reviews sounded fantastic, others very disappointed.  I prefer to order when most reviews are 4 or 5 stars, and since the clear majority on this product WERE 4 or 5 stars, I did place an order.  But that 20% of bad reviews did have me a bit worried.  My lap desk arrived about 2 weeks ago, and I've been using it a lot since.  Here's my experience thus far.PACKAGE: First off, the package in which the desk arrived was entirely appropriate and there was no damage to either the wood or finish.WOOD/FINISH:  Both the wood used and the finish on this item were similar to the other wooden surface lap desk we own ... suitable to the task, but not OVERLY durable.  This item was not designed to take abuse. If you take care of this item, it should last a good long time and look and perform great.  If you play rough with it, it will show wear. I feel totally comfortable using my rubber footed laptop or a leather or paper journal on this surface.  I would NOT use a wire spiral bound notebook on this surface without putting something underneath it.  If I need/want to take notes in a wire notebook, I lay down a linen towel first to protect the finish.  The FEEL of the item is very satisfying, but NOT heavy.HINGES:  The hinged lid opened just fine the first time, closed without difficulties, and has continued to do so since, with NO issues.  The lid is not loosely mounted at all, it's all quite secure. BUT, the hinges used to mount the lid do allow for a little natural wiggle as there is play in the mechanism of the hinges themselves. If you grip the lid and try to move it about a bit, it will wiggle, but this is normal for the kind of hinges used.  The arm hinge on the right side is designed to hold the lid in the open position when desired (which it does with no issues), and the mechanism which allows for this ""lock open"" feature is not a hard ""CLICK"" lock, but a more gentle rounded notch, which will wiggle just a bit, but not objectionably so for the intended use.  I've seen this sort of hinge used before, and this one behaves like all the other ones I've seen. The two simple butt hinges used between the lid and the base also have a certain amount of natural wiggle in them, again nothing objectionable and all very normal for the type of hing it is, nor will these hinges render the motion of the lid awkward or undesirable in any way.  But, if you're expecting completely smooth, wiggle free, click-lock functionality, then look for a desk that runs about $200 or more.  COULD the manufacturer have chosen more high-precision hinges? Sure ... but you wouldn't be paying in the neighborhood of $40 for the desk any more.  So, my assessment is, given the price range, I think the hinges will be just fine and I am not at all disappointed. As a counter point, I bought a wooden writer's box 20 years ago which has incredible hinges that are smooth as glass and wiggle free.  Today such a box would run well over $200, and I think it cost me about $150 back then.MOUNTING HARDWARE:  That's the hinges themselves.  There were also some comments about the mounting of the hinges being flimsy.  Well, when you mount hinges in relatively thin (between 5/16"" and 3/8"" thick) pieces of wood with relatively small screws (long screws aren't an option with thin wood), it's not the sort of set up I'd suggest turning over to a child to play with.  This is a relatively delicate piece of work designed for use by careful grown ups, not a child proof ""throw it around and see what it can take"" sort of piece.  The way I use such items, I think it should last for many years, as some reviewers suggest theirs did (I believe one person quoted something around 10 years).  Would I jerk the lid on this unit around with all my strength or pick it up, fully loaded, by the open lid?  No.  Would I open and close it during normal use without fear of it being damaged, by all means, yes. I understand that some of us need ""field grade"" pieces for use outdoors or on construction or manufacturing sites.  I would not recommend this item for such heavy use. But for use in my home for my paper and PC based writing, I'm totally convinced it will work out just fine.SIZE: Some folks took issue with the size of this lap desk not being quite as big as they though it would be.  At about 18"" x 14"", the size of the lap desk surface is about 2"" longer and 4"" inches deeper than the laptop I use, (keeping in mind that 2"" of the depth is the pencil shelf area in the back, behind the hinges).This provides an overall surface space which I find totally adequate for using my Dell Latitude E6530 or any of the paper journals or notebooks I use.  Some very large art pads might be an issue.INTERIOR: The inside of this unit was a real treat to discover.  There are two compartments, one running along the left (for pencils and smaller items) and one larger compartment for pads, tablets, etc.  It's felt lined (not sure exactly what fabric) and really wonderful.  The interior of this piece really gives it a special feel that I love.LAP INTERFACE:  A lap desk ... sits on your lap. :)  So what's the surface of this one like underneath, where it comes in contact with the lap? Think black beanbag.  It's a felt-like feel, easy to form around the different configurations of lap you present (straight legged, crossed, etc.) and I have had NO issues with comfort at all.  Very easy, very cozy.GAMER ALERT: If you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons or any another table-top, face to face role playing game that requires the person running the game to do some portion of their work behind a screen, this item is a total ""deity-send"". :)  Having played and run RPG's for about 20 years, it hit me about a week into owning this item ... ""OMG! ... I can use this as a GM (game master) screen! It's perfect""  The game master often needs to perform tasks the rest of the players aren't intended to see, such as rolling dice.  The felt lined interior chamber of this lap desk is PERFECT for rolling dice (stable, hidden, completely self-contained and, best of all, QUIET!)! And the ""stay open"" locking hinge means you don't have to use one hand or some home-made contraption to keep the lid open while you roll the dice, take notes, or do whatever it is you do.  Got miniature figures you don't want your players to see until they make their appearance in Act 2, Scene 3?  Keep them in the handy side compartment! Whether you run your game from a laptop or paper or both, this work surface has you covered.  I really think the manufacturer should hook up with game stores ... they'd definitely move a bunch of these!For the money I paid, I have absolutely no complaints about this lap desk.  It's a joy to use, and properly taken care of, should provide me with years of use and excellent appearance and aesthetics. If it all falls to crumbs in a short while, I'll be sure to come back here and tell you the whole story.  If you want a lap desk of this design that is bigger, tougher, ready for field use and totally wiggle free, expect it to be a lot heavier and a lot more expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBCV00PI9S7NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001I0F5T2#wasThisHelpful","RBCV00PI9S7NI","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried getting my wife the classic small Victorinox knives before (opaque red and transparent green) and they just don't tend to stick around.  They get lost or misplaced, and in no time, she's borrowing mine again.  Why?  The little classic single color knife just doesn't appeal to her sense of design, at all.  It's boring, masculine and not at all fun, from her feminine point of view.When I saw this Matrioshka model in a local VX store, I asked my wife what she thought of it, and she instantly took a shine to it.  ""It's kind of cute!"" So I did what any loving husband would do and ordered it for her the first chance I got.  And she loves it.  It reflects her tastes (and her homeland culture) far better than the classic red or groovy green I'd gotten her in the past, and it has a fun ""Oooo, let me see that"" factor when she takes it out to use it among friends.But let's be real ... if I asked my lovely wife right now what she thought of this little gift, she'd probably say ""It's nice ... I like it ... it's fine"" ... because it's a knife, and she's really not ""into"" knives.

"I will start this review by saying I am not an audiophile with demanding expectations of low cost ear buds.  I purchased these for listening to training on my computer, listening to music now and then, and for general use at work and at home around my computer.  That said, these are THE best fitting, most comfortable ear buds I've ever owned.THE USUAL PROBLEMS (for me)> Too large and don't nest well into my ear, and fall out too easily..> Ill shaped and don't conform well to the shape of my ear, and fall out too easily.> Both too large and ill shaped ... and fall out too easily.> Small enough to slide too deeply into the outer ear canal, where a partial seal is created, making them painful to pull out.WHAT PANASONIC GOT RIGHTI've never seen a pair of ear buds designed with this shape before.  I'm not saying they haven't been designed before, but I've certainly never seen it.  The base of the bud fits well in the larger part of the ear while the more tubular part of the bud nestles into the outer part of the ear canal ... each portion of the bud seats well in the different part of the ear it's designed to fit in.  Too many buds I've had over the years went for ""nesting in the outer ear only"" (which usually doesn't work, as the fit isn't very snug) or ""nesting in the more inner portion ear"".  These are the first I've had that do both, and they fit me to a T and stay in place for hours comfortably.The sound quality has been very good thus far and I have no complaints what soever.  Given the price, I'm really impressed with how nice these are.  I wouldn't trade them for anything I've tried before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DO52UQ81TAAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EM6AQE#wasThisHelpful","R1DO52UQ81TAAO","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A long time owner of many a Swiss Army Knife, a Swiss Tool and an assortment of other Swiss gear, I've been a fan of Victorinox for a long, long time. So when I decided to treat myself to a new knife/tool this birthday, my heart turned to my favorite Swiss manufacturer and I went browsing through their products until my eyes landed on the Victorinox Cybertool 29.  For my taste, some of the larger S.A.K.s are over-full of items while others too sparse ... the Cybertool 29 hits the mark just right in my opinion, with the right blend of blades, screw drivers and other tools to handle most of the situations that actually come up in my life as a commuter / IT professional and picnicker and camper with none that seem useless extras.  The IT tools are very well designed for use supporting most PC's and laptops, including a pet peeve item of mine, the little hex head you need to tighten the little nuts that secure D-SUB connectors.  The toothpick and tweezers are long time favorites and happily present on this knife, along with a functioning ball point and long steel pin.  The surprise item in all this for me turned out to be the small screw driver that nests in the helix of the cork screw and is well designed for tightening the screws in glasses, another thing I end up doing from time to time in  my life as a wearer of spectacles.  The 3.5x1"" design is compact and very comfortable in my pockets (not true of some of the super-wide S.A.K.s) and packs such a large number of useful items I really think it may be my all time favorite.UPDATE - OCTOBER 2014STILL my favorite Swiss Army Knife of all time, this unit is a real gem. After 1 year's use in tight places, it's my go-to tool for those tiny little screws that a lot of mini-driver sets don't handle well, and the blades and other tools are, as you'd expect from Swiss Army, just the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCV3WGGS3TV1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005ML8H#wasThisHelpful","RCV3WGGS3TV1V","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About 15 years ago, I stumbled across my first Wenger Swiss Army watch in a mall kiosk, as part of a promotion they were running. I picked it up for about $80 on special sale, about 1/3 the normal price at the time.  While not 100% identical to this model, it was about 90% the same ... dark blue face, large, easy to read light numbers, similar shapes (though the crystal was slightly domed and the blue finish matte).  It rapidly became my favorite watch of all time, and was running years later when a long bout of joblessness forced me to sell it.  It was a sad day for me, truly.Imagine my delight all these years later when I encountered virtually the same watch at virtually the same price!  It arrived today and it instantly felt like an old friend in my hands.  The quality of the make felt the same, the mechanism of the band the same ... it was a homecoming of sorts.  I'll report back in a few months and let you know how things go on this particular model.  But I'll share now what I loved so much about the previous iteration.1)  While the band is not what i was used to at the time (dual deployment latches), I rapidly became very fond of the mechanism.  It's easy to get in and out of, but never got flipped off by accident.2)  While I adjusted the band easily enough for myself last time ... no difficulties at all ... I'm going to follow the manufacturers advice this time and have a jeweler do it to avoid the slight scratches around the fittings from my less than artful application of small tools.3)  The watch kept consistent excellent time.4)  The weight feels substantial but never over-heavy.5)  The crystal face was extremely scratch resistant compared to other watches I've owned.6)  I just LOVE the way it looks.Again, I'll report back on the performance in a few months and let you know how it goes.A note to potential buyers.  Swiss Army Victorinox purchases Wenger a few years back, and in January of 2013 announced that all Wenger products would be rebranded as Victorinox, so you might want to check out their site as well.  I LOVE their knives and tools, and I'm sure the tradition of great Swiss Army watches is not in danger one ounce. Or should that be gram.  ;)PS ... thanks to my Swiss ancestors for giving birth to such great products.UPDATE - 10/20/2013I have the watch in my hands now, the jeweler has adjusted the band, and I'd have to say this is every bit as good a watch as the one I remember from 15 years ago.  The band is very high quality and the latch is top notch, no complaints.  Everything looks AOK at this point, and as the watch came with a 3 year warranty, I'm quite satisfied.  More updates as required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHO77RLAU0XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SIKTXI#wasThisHelpful","R1MHO77RLAU0XA","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider myself fantastically fortunate to work for an organization whose leaden laborer labyrinths happily host high-spirited, haphazard Nerf Wars. Chalk it up to ""forward thinking stress management"", but I love the fact that our managers, directors and VP's simply accept these outbreaks of co-worker cubicle combat as a normal part of the business cycle.  The weapons wielded in these whimsical weekly worker wars range from the smallest single shooters to behemoth, battery-operated bread-winner blasters.Having worked in this environment for over a year, I finally decided it was time for me to invest in my own personal Nerf defense solution.  Rarely in my cube for long stretches of time, my work keeps my endlessly attending meetings and scouring the office landscape for new data to analyze.  Hardly a work profile suited to large, unwieldy, motorized weapons, I quickly realized that I needed something small and portable enough to keep in one of my many vest pockets, yet offering more than the single-shot capability I'd seen in some of the smallest Nerf models. Thus, the Triad EX-3 immediately caught my eye.With three rounds at the ready and range (75 feet) as good as any but the most powerful models, this accurate, easy to use pocket ready design is a total winner in my book.  And if I happen to forget to leave it at work and it accompanies me home for the evening, our family felines love to chase the darts as they fly through the air and bounce across the floor.Office defender and cat toy, all rolled into one efficient and handsome design, the Triad is definitely the Nerf defense solution for me.Nerf N-Strike Elite Triad EX-3 Blaster","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LT35E2OL0P5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T45X82#wasThisHelpful","R1LT35E2OL0P5W","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I have used this small coffee maker in a few B&B's we've visited for romantic or writer's get-ways and decided to buy one for ourselves.  We prefer ground coffee to instant, and find the French press a bit more hassle than we want on some days of the week.  We also love the fact that the built in timer allows you to wake up to fresh coffee in the morning.We also enjoy the fact that little coffee maker offers the option of using either paper filters or a wire mesh filter (available on Amazon, but not supplied WITH the coffee maker), depending on whether you prefer your coffee with all the oils (use the mesh filter) or ""cleaner"" and ""less oily"" (use paper filters).  The coffee maker works very well with either.NOTE:  While the DRX5 will use either wire-mesh or paper filters, it comes equipped with neither, so pre-order one or the other with your coffee maker, so you can use it the first day.SUGGESTION:  With the mesh filter selling for less than $1 on Amazon, and paper filters selling for less than a penny each, I don't see why Mr. Coffee doesn't supply one or the other in the box with this coffee maker.  My ONLY gripe about this item is that you have to run to the store and buy filters or order a wire mesh filter basket yourself.  Both are so cheap, they should be included by the manufacturer in the box to allow you to use it right away.  I don't know why they didn't do that ... cost certainly isn't the issue.  Using the standard 4 times multiplier for cost to retail, even if the company bought this stuff at full retail price, it would add only $4 to the cost of the coffee maker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15JQJ5OV1GFXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0008JIW8U#wasThisHelpful","R15JQJ5OV1GFXK","A402IK8HX9SBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A402IK8HX9SBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm 5'0 and about 140 lbs. I wear a US 10-12. I bought the Pewter M size of these pants. Since I'm on the shorter size, these pants are a bit long on me, I'll have to sew them up. They do have about a 5 inch slit on the bottom that makes the pants look a little funny since they are so long on me, hopefully after I hem them they look great. Also, I""m a bit curvy and have junk in the trunk and these pants kinda bag up weird around the crotch area, like I could wear these backwards and they would look the same. I washed them in a hope that the baggy area up front would go down a little, but it didn't really help. Maybe I'll order size S next time. Overall, they are the color I wanted and they are cute.

"This is a very good Nero Wolfe pastiche by Robert Goldsborough, the 11th in a series he has done since the death of Rex Stout.  This one has an exceptionally good plot with a nice twist at the end.The novel is set in the 1970's and has many of the standard characters we know and love from the original Rex Stout series.  Lon Cohen has a larger-than-usual role in this one as he represents the client when The Gazette hires Wolfe to investigate the death of one of their columnists.The main problem with this book is that Wolfe just does not sound like himself.  He sounds rather more like a parody of Nero Wolfe.  Fortunately the author does a good job with Archie's dialogue most of the time.There are some good bits for long-time readers of Nero Wolfe.  Archie and Lily have several nice scenes and hear a bit more from Fritz than in many of the mysteries.All in all this is an enjoyable read for Nero Wolfe fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4S0QRP8MGQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504023579#wasThisHelpful","RH4S0QRP8MGQS","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful travel guide to Italy perfect for planning a trip.  However at nearly 1000 pages, it is most certainly not the guidebook you want to carry with you while travelling.The book is divided into sections, such as Rome, Northern Italy, Tuscany, Sicily, etc.  Each section has a useful introduction, a planner, recommendations for where to eat and stay, and highlights of the region - such as Venice, Florence, The Ionian Coast, etc.  There are occasional ""Fodor's Features"" with more information about Ancient Rome, Renaissance Art, and other topics.There are small maps throughout the book and a larger attached map of Rome.  The graphics are disappointing and uneven.

"This is a valuable record of the private meetings between Peter Kalms and the Lubavitcher Rebbe that offers a rare glimpse into the details of such meetings.  Unfortunately, the particular matters being discussed are not intrinsically interesting in themselves and the constant updates on their various projects soon becomes dull.  Kalms had the very good idea of including copies of letters received from the Rebbe at the end of most chapters.  This also provides interesting insight into how the Rebbe communicated with his followers and details on his worldview.The book is weakened by the addition of two additional sections.  The first is a one-sided reconstruction of the correspondence from the Rebbe to Chief Rabbi Jakobovitz following the Six Day War.  It is difficult to judge what Jakobovitz's contribution to the conversation might have been.  It appears that the concerns that the Rebbe had about the treaty details between Israel and its Arab neighbors were largely misplaced, though it is difficult to judge as very little context is given for the correspondence.The second additional section is by Herman Branover, a Russian Refusenik and physicist.  This is an embarrassing defense of the Rebbe's rejection of modern science.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R110HEF3EKOWU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9652930695#wasThisHelpful","R110HEF3EKOWU1","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hofer also includes some nice science in this book as he explores genetics, medicine, the effects of relativity and space travel.Readers familiar with McMinnville Oregon will enjoy the local references.

"This is a very nice low-end 32 inch TV.  It is easy to set-up and connect and has fine picture quality (using LED).  It looks rather like an extra-large PC monitor.

It is rather amazing that a 32 inch TV seems smallish, but its really just fine for watching movies across the room.Here are some other observations.  It is surprisingly light, easily carried in one hand.  It has a generous array of connectors in the back, including an 1/8 audio port, which makes it much easier to stream shows from a computer or tablet. This also means you can use computer speakers as a cheap and easy way of getting better quality sound. The color is clean, crisp, and bright. The unit starts in power save mode. You can get a more vivid picture by switching it out of this mode when you first turn it on.  It comes with a sturdy stoppered base.

"When I received my free review copy of this book through the Vine program, I was surprised to see a hardback textbook published by The MIT Press. Most writing about the Internet is just as ephemeral as most of the content on the Internet and I did not expect that a book about the Comments Sections found on many blogs, new sites, and social media sites, would have much staying power.I was wrong.Joseph M. Reagle, Jr., has written an intelligent and interesting study about the comments sections, ratings, likes, and all the other user-generated content that comes with many Internet sites and applications. I am firmly in the dont read the comments camp, but the author does make a case for the utility of some kinds of comments, such as the reviews on Amazon.There are nine chapters with titles such as Informed, Manipulated, Improved, Alienated, and Bemused. There are several especially interesting discussions: how rewards affect the balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, the loss of context through hypertextual and hypotextual comments, and the invisible serendipity of on-line communities.This book comes with the standard academic textbook features that I like such as footnotes collected by chapter at the end of the book and an index. I am sorry that so many non-fiction books are being published without indexes. This index is pretty good, though it is missing terms found in the book. For example, many web users do not read comments like this review because they are too long to read (tltr)  a useful term that is not in the index.This is, however, the first index that I have ever read that includes an entry for Internet f*ckwad theory, which gives you a good sense for the kind of people that often comment. The author discusses trolls (and trollplex) as well as other forms of sexism, racism, and harassment. Despite this very good book, I am still not inclined to read the comments on most web sites.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC03IL5A5YZ9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=026202893X#wasThisHelpful","RC03IL5A5YZ9B","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jan Chozen Bays has written a very good book about the importance of mindfulness.  She includes 53 mindfulness exercises in a series of short chapters averaging about 4 pages each.  Many of these exercises seem quite useful to me, but you would certainly want to space them out - say one a week - rather than try to do multiple ones at the same time.Overall there is an emphasis on getting people out of their heads and into their bodies (the wild elephant) with these exercises.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WK3F89QHQWN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590308174#wasThisHelpful","R1WK3F89QHQWN3","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clear logical thinking applied to the issue of how to maximize the return on any investments (including both time and money) you make to charities.  The author finds a number of non-intuitive results, such as that buying sweat-shop goods is ethical, that donating to disaster relief is inefficient, and that donating to established charities that run multiple programs is probably not the best choice.  This book builds on the influential ideas of Peter Singer on effective altruism and follows a generally utilitarian approach to altruism.MacAskill is particularly good in assessing the counterfactual, i.e. looking at what would happen if you did not donate to a particular charity or if a particular program was not implemented, as many good ideas actually turn out to make the problem they attempt to fix worse.The emphasis throughout the book is on a rational approach to maximizing the positive effect of your altruistic actions.  I think the author overlooks that often we find ourselves emotionally drawn to one kind of charity or another that may have a low return.  However, if it is not for the emotional draw, we might choose not to donate at all.  Perhaps in such cases it makes rational sense not to try to maximize your charitable investments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2COFOB7ZDDXTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409105#wasThisHelpful","R2COFOB7ZDDXTB","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This volume Usagi Yojimbo: Senso is a very dramatic addition to Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo stories and could even serve as the end of the series!  Set 15 years in the Usagi Yojimbo future, it features many of the major characters we've come to know (and love or hate) in an epic battle against the Martian Invaders from H.G. Well's The War of the Worlds!It is an odd premise, and the story has just enough science fiction to it that the reader might take this to be an alternate ending to the Usagi series, fortunately set far enough in the future that we can look forward to many more Usagi Yojimbo volumes.But it doesn't feel that way.  This book has a major emotional impact in part because so many of the characters we know in the series meet their ends here.  Well-known villains die, often with an unexpected nobility.  Others, both heroes and villains, are just killed by the fearsome weapons of the Martians.  Usagi, Tomoe, and Jotaro finally achieve some resolution to their difficult situations, but only at great cost.Sakai's drawings are superb and the action is non-stop.  There are any number of ""easter eggs"" throughout the book that reward careful re-reading.  Fans of the series must read this story.  New comers to Usagi Yojimbo should save it until after they've read the other volumes.Wow!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTU48VKD1YKJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616557095#wasThisHelpful","RTU48VKD1YKJZ","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is van der Post's personal memoir of June, with extensive biographical information.  He tells a good story, though his writing style is sometimes a bit turgid.Unfortunately it is impossible to know which of these stories are true and which are, well, stories.  After van der Post's death, it became clear that he exaggerated, lied,and was otherwise an unreliable historian.  This is documented in a biography (Teller of Many Tales: The Lives of Laurens van der Post) about Laurens van der Post that makes interesting, but discouraging, reading.So I would like to believe many of the things written here about Jung's witty remarks and wisdom - and many of them may be true - but van der Post's reliability is so poor that one simply can't be sure what really happened or was said and what was just invented.

"This book was surprisingly entertaining for the most part, but frustrating.  One never does find out what wolves, flash boys, quants, and master of the universe are, let alone why they misrepresent the financial industry.  Trennert's authorial voice is entertaining and he clearly has a lot of anecdotes from his years on Wall Street.  Perhaps he dictated the book and then had the recordings transcribed.Although Trennert seems to be discussing the world of high finance, what he really describes is his career in sales.  He spends too much time travelling and drinking (oddly, visiting lovely Portland, Oregon seems to be one of the worst things that can happen to the frequent flyer).  Successful sales people make a lot of money but they are just selling and need to remember that they are not necessarily deep thinkers.  This becomes quite clear in the last few chapters of the book when Trennert stops telling stories and starts offering ideas.  These, unfortunately, are a mushy mix of Republican political ideas with some largely discredited supply-side economic ideas. One wishes he read The Economist.Trennert writes as if this is his retirement memoir after a long successful career on Wall Street.  Yet it appears from this book that Trennert is in his late-40's.  This makes for an occasionally jarring reading experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRBN9KUXR7L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250068274#wasThisHelpful","RLRBN9KUXR7L7","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The essays are generally well-written, erudite, humorous, and interesting, though occasionally he engages in bouts of nit-picking with other Freudian analysts.  They are organized around a general theme of making the unexamined life conscious, often by asking questions such as ""what is the unconscious problem than your belief solves for you?""The book assumes a deep knowledge of Freud's writings, some clinical experience, and familiarity with later Freudian theorists such as D.

"There are too many people consuming too many resources to sustain our capitalism economic system.  That provocative thesis is the one that Jerry Mander hammers home for 11 depressing chapters.  In Chapter 12, he offers some alternatives and partial solutions to the problems.This book is very well-written, persuasive, and quite sobering.  After exposing the enormity of the environmental and social problems we face, his solutions and suggestion seem unfortunately feeble.  Mander is blunt, intelligent, and convincing on the problem.  Why then is he so tentative about the solutions?  In particular, it seems quite obvious that the Earth does not have the long-term carrying capacity needed for our current human population levels.  Yet he only devotes one short paragraph to the problem of overpopulation.Despite that odd oversight, this is a great book.

"Man in Profile: Joseph Mitchell of The New Yorker is a good biography of a very fine writer for ""The New Yorker"" magazine.  Mitchell wrote long profile pieces for the magazine for decades.  One of the mysteries about Mitchell is that he did not publish anything in the last decades of his long life, leading to the joke that he had the world's worst case of writer's block.The truth is more subtle and Thomas Kunkel does a very good job of giving us both the facts of Mitchell's life and a convincing look at the inner man as well.  Readers who enjoyed Mitchell's fine collection, Up in the Old Hotel, will be pleased to get further information about some of these memorable pieces.  I was especially interested in the long description of Mitchell's interview with Mr. Hunter of ""Mr. Hunters Grave.""Kunkel describes how Mitchell searched for the ""revealing remark"" when he interviewed people.  This was the thing that really touched the speaker and made it possible for Mitchell to find out what was really important to the speaker and then write about it.  Unfortunately, Kunkel was unable to interview Mitchell for this biography and so it lacks that ""revealing remark"" that would let us really know Mitchell.

"Jon Acuff's latest book, Do Over: Rescue Monday, Reinvent Your Work, and Never Get Stuck, is a blog-to-book that actually works pretty well.  He has some lightweight career advice that should be helpful to people just entering the workforce.  He points out, for example, that when you have a job you have to show up everyday on-time and actually work as long as you are supposed to.His other advice, nicely packaged, is basic and similarly useful.  You should build a ""Career Savings Account"" by investing energy in relationships (networking), skills, character, and hustle (effort).  Each of these four points is discussed in a number of short chapters.I confess to being annoyed by Acuff's repeated references to his ""New York Times bestselling"" book Start: Punch Fear in the Face, Escape Average and Do Work that Matters.  A quick Google search reveals that Start did indeed appear on the New York Times bestselling book for one week as the 5th listing in one of the self-help categories.  I don't know if this is an actual example of the recent trend of buying your way onto the list or not, but it does seem a trifle dishonest to this reviewer and inappropriate in a book in which the author stresses the importance of honesty as a character trait.Readers interested in other books about managing their careers should also consider reading:  How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life, What Color Is Your Parachute? 2015: A Practical Manual for Job-Hunters and Career-Changers, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MZZ4GVSOKV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847613#wasThisHelpful","R39MZZ4GVSOKV1","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cousineau's book on traveling is generally interesting and well written.  It suffers from two main defects:  it is unfocused and it quotes widely from other writers without really connecting the quotations to the author's own viewpoint.

"This is a great book about writing that generalizes to any creative endeavor in your life.  Little of the advice given in the book is directly related to writing.  Almost all of the advice applies equally well to any part of your life where you are held back by self-criticism, unrealistic expectations, and unclear thinking.  Ueland's approach is honest and direct and inspiring.Unfortunately, the BN Publishing edition - a print on demand service - is terrible.  There are missing letters, missing words, odd line jumps, and other marks of a hasty electronic conversion.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in doing any creative work.

"I've had good luck with Omron pedometers.  They are sturdy and perform well.  The HJ325 is an attractive model with easy-to-use controls.  The optional belt clip-on attachment also works well.It also has the best battery case that I've seen in a pedometer.  No screwdriver required!  No small screws to lose!  It uses an ingenious locking mechanism that is built in to the battery case cover.My only (quite mild) complaint is that this pedometer does not track ""steps"" from cycling or the elliptical machine.

"This is Emma updated for the turn of the 21st Century.  It provides the early background for Emma and her father before where the original novel by Austin begins.  Then the events of the Austin novel are repeated - in an updated and simplified way - in a modern novel style.  There descriptive passages are shorter but the original Emma feeling is preserved.All in all, Smith, has produced a well-written and enjoyable update.  Unfortunately the last chapter is a let down, it fails to be appropriately romantic and preachy.  The author's message, already clear to the reader, is wielded with all the subtlety of a bludgeon - such as Smith might have used in one of his popular detective novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPSYHQ95ZPQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804197954#wasThisHelpful","R1CPSYHQ95ZPQW","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh title in Martin Walker's series of books about Chief Bruno set in St. Denis, France.  It's one of the better titles in the series and a welcome return to form after a couple of weaker books.Some plot elements are predictable.  Muslim terrorists invade a sleepy French village yet again.  Bruno, even with the resources of the entire French police system and military, once again winds up being the person that saves the day in an exciting military-style gun battle.  And Bruno, once again, has his pick of the ladies as he cooks wonderful French food.Fortunately the Bruno character is interesting enough to carry the novel.  The plot holds together reasonably well and there are some attractive new characters in this book.  All in all, a very welcome addition to the Bruno canon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWT0DOFOL1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354150#wasThisHelpful","R3PWT0DOFOL1Q","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's set the stage.  George Wilhelm Frederich Hegel, 1770- 1831, was an important German philosopher who made original contributions to philosophy, in part as a reaction to Kant. Jacques Marie Emile Lacan, 1901 - 1981, was a French Freudian psychoanalyst who gave a long series of annual seminars that were important in Parisian cultural life.This is an English translation of Zizek's 1982 Ph.D. dissertation. It is an exploration of Hegelian dialectic and Lacanian psychoanalysis and how these inform each other.  It is not easy reading, but it is interesting, intellectual, and surprisingly humorous at times.Zizek is a well known Marxist cultural critic and writer.  I think this would be an intimidating book for anyone without a good background in philosophy and a reasonable acquaintance with Freudian theory.  It is, I suspect, exactly the sort of book that a French intellectual would have to know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14034SZT4DZFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745663753#wasThisHelpful","R14034SZT4DZFI","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rebels at Work: A Handbook for Leading Change from Within by Kelly and Medina is a wonderful handbook for change agents.  There are ten chapters that lay out the entire journey of a change agent, with lots of helpful hints, important advice, and useful tips.  It's like having two experience mentors at your side guiding you through the often difficult issues that change agents encounter.There are chapters on gaining credibility, navigating the organizational landscape, communicating, managing conflict, and similar essential topics.  There are helpful charts and lists.  There are interesting, and sometimes inspiring, sidebars by the two authors about their own change efforts - not all of which were successful.  This is now the first book I would recommend to anyone seeking to make important changes in big organizations.Some of the design choices for this books are a bit odd - important Notes are shown in a tiny font and the photographs of the two authors, which appear in their sidebars, are washed out.  However two sections of the book near the end - Recommended Reading and the Glossary - are superb (and humorous) and should not be skipped.  There is a link in one of the glossary entries, for example, to a fascinating blog post by Medina about Obama Care that should not be missed.  And one of the recommended books is Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool's Guide to Surviving with Grace; this is one of the best business books I have ever read and it deserves to be better known.Being a change agent is both hard and difficult.  This book makes it a little easier.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TEA9IS39V2VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1491903953#wasThisHelpful","R3TEA9IS39V2VM","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is apparently the decade for people to walk the Camino de Santiago and write a book about their experiences.  Some of these are interesting and well written (I like The Way of the Stars: Journeys on the Camino de Santiago and Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son), some are guidebooks (see for example A Pilgrim's Guide to the Camino de Santiago: St. Jean * Roncesvalles * Santiago (Camino Guides), and some are simply embarrassing (see The Camino: A Journey of the Spirit or The Pilgrimage (Plus).Walking Home: A Pilgrimage from Humbled to Healed by Sonia Choquette is, unfortunately, in the latter category.  Choquette's brother and father die, she breaks up with her husband of 30 years, and decides on the spur of the moment to take a 500 mile hike in Spain.  It's reasonably well-written and starts strong, but soon lapses into a mushy New Age mysticism along with descriptions of her emotional pain.  I'm sure she was in pain, but it does not make for inspired reading.  Indeed the author demonstrates just how shallow ""New Age"" thinking can be.I admire people who do this pilgrimage, but I wish fewer of them would write about their experiences.  This book was a disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ASYWW9NW1FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944515#wasThisHelpful","R23ASYWW9NW1FH","AV44NCH7K65PC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV44NCH7K65PC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very interested in getting Lewis and Clark (game) but had heard that Discoveries was coming out, so I waited for that instead. One common complaint with Lewis and Clark was that near mid/end game it really bogged down and turns took forever. Discoveries is a more streamlined dice/worker placement game that evokes similarities to Lewis and Clark but is different in its own respects.So while a game like ""Roll for the Galaxy"" is the dice version of ""Race to the Galaxy,"" Discoveries is not really the ""dice version"" of Lewis and Clark but it is close.Each player is starts with 5 dice of their color. The dice have different faces that can be used to do different actions (the worker placement aspect of the game). The actions activated can either help the players work towards completing journeys (and getting victory points) or befriending indian tribes that left the player do more robust actions and special abilities going forward.At surface, the game seems simple with its seemingly simple components - a central game board where used dice go, player boards that depict available actions, cards, and dice. But, similar to Lewis and Clark, Discoveries becomes very deep and ""thinky"" mid/late game due to your camp's ever growing range of available actions and abilities. But it never really quite bogs down because you are still only allowed to use the dice as they are presented in front of you. So while there are some turns that may take some time while player's think about their strategy, generally the game moves at a brisk pace. This is especially evident on subsequent playthroughs when players have developed a strategy from the beginning.Set-up is very simple. There are some set up differences between a 2, 3, or 4 player game but it is not hard to remember or implement.Games w/ 4 players i have found take about 1 hour for new players, closer to 45 minutes or so for repeat plays.Highly recommended.Other games I really enjoy: Five Tribes, Istanbul, San Juan, Orleans, Patchwork.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYTA4REEI1G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z62YCPQ#wasThisHelpful","RPYTA4REEI1G4","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That is completely wrong. Each patchwork piece is uniquely shaped - think Tetris. The puzzle lies within how to optimize putting these various pieces into your 9x9 player grid.

Yes, there are cheaper alternatives out there (see: Times Up! Title Recall). However, I would highly suggest purchasing Monikers instead, especially if you are in the age range of 18-35.Monikers' cards contain more pop culture topics than alternatives. Sometimes they contain internet memes/stars that my group wasn't familiar with, but that was always OK beacuse of the new huge plus about monikers:Every card has a description on it!!

"very nice pet crate. easily expandable to give your pet some more room to move around which I appreciate.The 2 entrance gates work smoothly. Assembly was very easy. I did it by myself with no issues. The bottom plastic tray is a little uncomfortable (lots of ridges to accommodate the expandable nature of the crate) but nothing a few blankets can't fix.I rate this product easily as 5 stars, although it is quite expensive compared to regular wire crates. And one caveat that I did not think of before hand --- your dog might scratch at the wood when the crate is locked. This can cause them to get splinters in their paws, or to ingest the wood. I remedied this by:- Buying 1/8"" thick panels of Lexan Polycarbonate clear plastic (virtually indestructible)- Buying Hyde Tools 45730 Plastic Laminate Scoring Knife (to cut said polycarbonate into smaller panels i could attach to the wood pet crate)- Using 5/8"" wood screws to secure the polycarbonate to the wood of the crate.

I would imagine it the supplied screws fit most if not all main manufacturers.It also comes with 2 different size wood screws to drill into your wall/furniture for the other end of the strap.The straps themselves are sturdy, and the length is very easily adjustable.A+ product all around, gives me a good peace of mind that the TV won't fall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2V4UYBYCCG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IVDP3I#wasThisHelpful","R1A2V4UYBYCCG6","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Interesting game. It is a cooperative game where everyone can see each other cards, and you dont know what cards you yourself hold in your hand. You can either give people hints on what is in their hand, discard cards for more opportunites to give hints, or play a card down in the communal playing board (and it has to be in the correct order, which is why people need to give you hints about what cards you're holding).Our gaming group only really plays non-cooperative games (7 Wonders, Settlers, etc) so a cooperative game was refreshing to play. However my only real gripe is that there is no definitive end-game. There is just a scoring scale on how many cards your group correctly placed down in the communal area when all the cards are exhausted. So basically its kind of like you are playing for a high score so-to-speak. You could shoot for getting a perfect score but that is fairly hard to do in the base game (there are wild cards / rule variations).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N97RQP6PNFNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYQ9Q76#wasThisHelpful","R3N97RQP6PNFNN","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As long as you aware of this products limitations, i think you'd be pleasantly surprised at how well it works.Is it going to give your nice dress shirt a freshly pressed look? Absolutely not. I might use the spray on some of my work clothing to help a little with wrinkles, but for anything major this will not do the trick.What this products exceeds at particularly well at is getting rid of wrinkles in soft cotton products. Best example is that nice soft T-shirt you might have folded up in a drawer and would like to wear on a sunny day. I had a soft cotton t-shirt (95% cotton, 5% spandex) that was mistankingly left in a drawer all crumpled up after being washed. It was a massive wrinkle mess. After spraying the shirt with this spray and smoothing it out on the ground, the shirt literally looked like it was fresh out of the dryer.Bottom line: casual clothing, soft cotton = this product is great.

"Bought this indoor trampoline for our toddler for Christmas. It is a great product but not worthy of a full 5-star rating. Below is my full review:Packaging: the trampoline comes in a box that is approx. 4 feet long and maybe 1 foot high. It is fairly heavy. My packaging was filthy, not sure if others come like it too.Setup: another review mentioned putting something on the ground to cover it while building the trampoline. If you are setting it up indoors, I highly second this idea. I bought one of those plastic drop cloths used for painting at the local hardware store for 2 dollars. The parts of this trampoline arrived extremely dirty. The metal parts, as mentioned by others, have some sort of grease on them. Prepare to wash your hands multiple times and they will still smell like metal.The instructions are horrid. I know pretty much every other reviewer says the same thing. You can pretty much throw them away and just look at the picture of the trampoline to figure out how to build it. Building it took my wife and I a couple hours and was not hard at all. A lot of the time we just spent looking at the instructions trying to figure out what they were trying to say (before ultimately just throwing them away).Finished product: pretty nice. Some of the safety netting arrived with small holes in it already. I am not sure if these are going to be an issue or not in the future. Because of this, and the poor instructions, I took off 1 star. The instructions do not state a weight limit; another reviewer said it was 150 lbs. I got in the trampoline with my toddler (combined weight over 150 lbs) and the trampoline felt very sturdy. I obviously did not jump like I would on a big trampoline.The jumping area is just shy of 6 feet in diameter. The whole trampoline, including springs/mat, is a little over 7 feet in diamter. I estimate the total enclosure to be 8 feet tall or so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIWL9MRZQ1F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMZVALC#wasThisHelpful","RTIWL9MRZQ1F6","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like most parents, I have gone through my fair share of sippy cups (Zoli, Playtex straw cup, etc.)This is a pretty good one. I have found that being leak-proof and easy-to-clean are mutually exclusive things (if your cup is leak-proof, it's probably a little harder to clean since it has mechanisms to trap water). For that reason, I grew really tired of cleaning the Zoli cup.This cup, when the straw is up, is not leakproof. Hold it upside down and water WILL drip out, either from the side of the straw or the straw itself.When the straw is down (lid twisted shut), in my experience it has NOT leaked.The act of twisting the lid to close/open the straw is, in my opinion, not easy for a 2-year (just turned 2) to do by themselves. This is a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you use this cup.My daughter (2) is on the small side, but she is stil able to easily hold this cup.I would purchase this cup again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFN8WLEZWL7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANJIE2E#wasThisHelpful","R3UFN8WLEZWL7Z","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned two Snark headstock tuners (the blue ones). They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating: the design of the ""ball joint"" that connects the tuner to the clip. Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint. I am a home player - I do not put the tuners under any type of stress.This Fender tuner is a great alternative. The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark. However, as others have mentioned, this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark. So, for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented. However, for the home player, this tuner will work just fine.The tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is smaller than a Snark (but not by much). The clip works well with a PRS headstock, which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstock.The only real negative I see is to change the battery (and to put the first battery in) requires the use of a very, very small phillips head screwdriver. I build computers so I had one handy, but I would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLJMERM1WVE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MR6IHK#wasThisHelpful","R3SLJMERM1WVE1","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"have a black Verizon Razr M.My previous screen protector (bought off ebay) had developed a scratch/bubble after almost a year of use (which in my opinion is pretty good!). Replaced it with this one i bought from amazon. The amazon one was a little more expensive but I wanted to have easy returns in case the product was for the wrong phone/etc.The install is very easy. Does not require water. Simple and common three step process (peel first protective layer away, smooth out bubbles, peel second protective layer off). Packaging comes with a mini plastic card to smooth out bubbles and a small lint cloth to clean your screen before you apply (fogging up your screen w/ your breath and then wiping with the cloth worked very well).The screen is matte, and does a decent job of anti-glare. Swiping feels smooth, and the screen does not interfere at all with typing/etc.I will update this review if any problems arise.

"i bought this nightlight in August 2011, shortly before my daughter was born. For the first 1.5 years of her life, she pretty much just used this nightlight as a toy: Constantly pushing the button to cycle through all the colors. It was dropped. It was dropped some more.Fast forward to present day, now that she is in a toddler bed, we decided to see if we could use this nightlight instead of one that plugs into an outlet. After all the abuse it took, the night light still works perfectly. We charge it during the day, and then the bear easily lasts all night off the charger (11+ hours).This is all in the instruction manual, but:1) when you turn the bear on, the default setting is to only have the light stay on for 30 minutes. You bypass this by holding the button down until the red light goes away. Now the light stays on indefinitely.2) there is a reset switch that can be accessed using a needle ... can solve a lot of problems (see other reviews)I took off one star because at the current price (doesnt ever seem to go on sale) it is quite expensive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7L0KU8NJ7CM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043G8OXC#wasThisHelpful","RQ7L0KU8NJ7CM","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have been using this scanner with two computers, one with Windows 7 64 bit and one with Ubuntu 10.04.For both OS this scanner has been plug and play, no additional software needed.With Win7, just plug in the scanner to the USB port and Windows will automatically download the correct driver. From there, you can either install Canon's provided scanning software or you can use MS Paint (included with Win7) to do your scanning. Canon's software, as other reviewers touch upon, offer some great flexibility and some useful features (such as auto-cropping) so it may suit your needs. Me personally I don't like installing additional software if I dont need to, and I dont particular need any post-processing (color adjust, cropping, etc) features that the Canon software may have because I prefer to work in Photoshop or MS Paint.So for Windows, you do NOT have to install the Canon software if you do not want to. Simply open up MS Paint, and in the file menu choose the option to retrieve from Scanner. It will give you simple options (such as scanning color picture or black and white) and if you go into the custom settings you can set the DPI of the scan. Much less flexibility than the Canon software but at least you dont have to install anyhting else on your computer.At 300dpi in MS Paint a scan of a black and white paper (say, an application form) takes ~15 seconds. If I up it to 400dpi the same scan takes ~35 seconds. The quality is great and 300dpi is more than enough for simple form scans. I'd probably bump it up as high as i could for picture scans though, if you werent pressed for time.The scanning bed is approx. 8.5"" by 12"". Perfect size for a regular paper size document but slightly small for a legal size document (8.5"" by 14""). To scan a legal size document I had to make two scans and then crop and paste them together (which is easily done in Paint). Kind of annoying but if you wanted to scan a legal size document in one go you would need an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) scanner and those are much more expensive, usually.This scanner is a bargain and has worked for me with no hiccups so far. Would recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XMERG5RVGJ3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VQR1UC#wasThisHelpful","R1XMERG5RVGJ3G","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have had this product for a while now and I have purposely waited on reviewing it because I wanted to see how it actually handled an ""accident."" Well a couple of nights ago my 9 month old daughter (and apparently her baby friends from that morning's Mommy and Me class) got sick and she threw up all in her crib. Poor girl.Her clothes and the crib sheet were soaked in vomit. The fitted pad was also soaked, however the mattress underneath was not at all wet. After throwing this pad (and her clothes/sheets) in the wash they came out looking, and more importantly SMELLING, brand new!Thankfully we had two of these sheets so we were able to put the spare one on while the dirty one was washing. We actually just ordered a third, because if our daughter had thrown up again that night we would have had to go with nothing on the mattress.In case it helps, we are using this fitted pad with this mattress:Naturepedic No Compromise Organic Cotton Classic 252 Crib MattressIt fits well, a little snug b/c i think it shrunk a little but still looks good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCID2QKLH2PW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UD65XQ#wasThisHelpful","RCID2QKLH2PW5","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For reference, my daughter right now is 9 months old, ~26 inches tall, ~16-17 lbs. She can crawl, and pull herself and stand on objects(cruise). She can not walk or stand by herself.Pros:- cute music and sounds effects for baby- my daughter LOVED the beach ball attachment- on high pile carpet, this toy was stable enough for my daughter to pull herself up on it and stand/cruise- plenty of activities for baby to play withCons:- toy is NOT stable on anything other than carpet, in my experience. When we put this toy on our daughters playmat, it would slide around whenever she wanted to stand on it. Annoying for her and also somewhat dangerous. The feet are ""hollow"" so there is really no area to add tacky rubber or anyting like that to the toys feet to add more traction. You need to put this toy on carpet or a plush rug.- my daughter is on the small side for her age and I feel like (at her height) she will outgrow this toy soon. Its a little low so when she stands up holding on to it, she kind of has to hunch over.All in all, I havent really found a better alternative than this toy (except our ottoman, which our daughter loves to cruise on too).

"I spent the whole weekend taking shots with this Softbox Umbrella. I paired this umbrella with my Alienbees B400 strobe. The Alienbees strobe is a lot bigger than a regular off-camera speedlite so it doesnt fit perfectly into this umbrella (the hole in the umbrella is big enough to go over the strobe, but the strobe's casing is a little too big so you can't fully close/zip up the umbrella around the strobe).This softbox produced wonderfully soft, even lighting. The catchlights were nice and round. Using the strobe for hours at a time I never felt like the umbrella trapped any excessive heat.Setup is extremely simple --- exactly like opening an umbrella. The product comes already assembled, the photographer does not have to do anything except open the umbrella. Tear down is a little longer than a regular umbrella just because you have to tuck the fabric into the umbrella when you are closing it. Takes maybe 30 seconds longer. You know something is easy to setup/teardown when you can easily get it back into its original packaging (and this product can do that very easily).I recommend this product and will buy more whenever I can afford more strobes :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D64E3ZUV11JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DM83KO#wasThisHelpful","R2D64E3ZUV11JH","A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found the legs to come open much easier as well.

This stand is holding it up no problem, with no extra weights/sandbags necessary.

"I recently picked this lens up about 3 months ago for my Pentax K-x.Previously, my ""workhorse"" lens is my Tamron 28-75mm f2.8.The low-light performance of this lens compared to my Tamron is impressive. With two additional stops (1.4 vs 2.8), I am now able to capture low-light pictures of my baby that were previously impossible to capture with my Tamrom (due to such a slow shutter speed). Where my Tamron at 2.8 may indicate a shutter speed of 1/15 for accurate exposure at a given ISO, with two additional stops from this prime I can go to a shutter speed of 1/60 at f1.4, which is much more suitable for capturing kids (not ideal, but much much better!)Images are sharp. At f1.4 sometimes images are soft but I more attribute that to user error due to the razor-thin DOF you are working with a 1.4.Cons would be the price, but there are rumors that Pentax lens prices will drop sometime this year back to their ""normal"" price levels. Also 50mm on a DSLR like the K-x is a little long for regular use...I find myself needing to back up a lot if I want to capture everything in the scene i want to (indoors, w/ baby)For what it's worth, I bought this lens from Amazon Warehouse Deals (Used - Like New) and it came as described.

"******Edit******Loved this garlic press until it broke the second time I used it!  I see other reviewers had the same or similar issue.  Very junky.I love fresh garlic but chopping it is such a pain and I have been reluctant to do so since cutting my finger the last time.  I have owned garlic presses in the past but lost mine in a recent move, so when I found Kitchenlani, I was excited to find a press at an affordable price.  This press works very well, its easy to clean and makes using fresh garlic so much easier.  Perfect for sauteing and adds a deep, rich flavor to my meals.

"I originally ordered these socks for my husband, he has very sweaty feet and hasn't found anything that keeps the moisture and odor at bay.  He loves them, they keep his feet dry and no more smelly socks laying around the bedroom floor.  I ended up liking his results so much that I decided to try the socks myself.  They are great, so incredibly soft and they are perfect for trips to the gym.

"I had quite mixed reactions to this book. On the pro side, I felt that I gained a much better understanding of the wide range of attitudes (including those opposed to my own) toward religious education in the schools. All of this has been very valuable and immediately useful to me in daily life.I also feel a greater respect for the complexities and challenges raised by this whole endeavor. To my surprise, I found myself a bit overwhelmed by the touchiness of the subject matter, given the attempt to keep schools neutral on the subject of religion, the emotion behind parents' desires for their children's spiritual guidance (and their right to feel that way), and  the subjective nature the material covered. I had difficulty with the idea of religious education in school for six year old children.Wertheimer's discussion of the well designed and implemented program in Modesto was somewhat convincing, and I hope that others like it will be developed and presented with as much care and sensitivity as that one,The biggest reservations I had reading this book had to do with the actual reading...sometimes very long paragraphs that sometimes wandered, and kind of a dry, staccato writing style that for me lacked flow.Still, Wertheimer has brought up very significant points, covered them well, perhaps helped us understand each other a bit more, and raised many questions well worth deeper consideration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YBBTQIEVHDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807086169#wasThisHelpful","R6YBBTQIEVHDF","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Daniel Willingham has done a superb job of bringing insight and empathy to parents and teachers, and to children learning to read. The process of learning to read is explored and analyzed, and its  three main elements (decoding, comprehension and motivation) are discussed again and again throughout the book.The book is divided into three main sections, each dedicated to a phase of the child's development. There are frequent illustrations throughout. Gillingham's  take on all of this is imaginative and compelling, highlighted by stories of his experiences with his own children. Warmth, loving acceptance, and empathy are present throughout. Each chapter ends with a very useful summary, another are many sidebars with suggestions for readers to try. There is an intriguing list of references at the end, followed by suggestions for further reading.There is lots to experiment with here in this very readable, friendly, comprehesive, creative book.

"This book is divided into tthree parts. Part I deals with the definition and nature of failure, and the fear and stigma associated with it. Part II discusses failure as it applies to various sizes of businesses at various developmental stages. Each chapter in Part III is dedicated to one of the 7 Rs of the Failure Value Cycle. The book is full of general advice,specific suggestions and takeaways that help one be ready to cope with obstacles  in the most positive way, growing and improving from them. As the authors write, Failure happens to all of us. so lets get over it and learn from it.Both of the authors are professors (having taught at Berkeley ,among other places) and their writing is articulate and very readable. There are useful aphorisms to ponder, like failure is like gravity.There is a fair amount of key concepts, but maybe that means that one doesnt have to read from cover to cover to benefit from this book.The 7 stage Failure Value Cycle is useful, though a bit cumbersome. I found the chapter on reflection to be the most valuable.All in all, this book has much to offer, anti for a book of this kind, it is well written.

"This book addresses the highs and low of friendships with between women.  Some of the topics discussed include the importance women's need for female company, different types or levels of friendship, loyalty among friends, choosing relationships over trivial disagreements, establishing healthy boundaries, and the importance of  humility. I was surprised to find that this book is classified as a general self-help book; it seems to be dedicated more to Christian readers. There is much discussion of religion; in addition, there are lots of  lovely insights and suggestions for opening up to others, building relationships, and just trying to be decent human beings. She discusses the fear that can underlie some of our impulsive, unfortunate choices. I appreciate her chapter about sensible use of technology.I ordered this book hoping to get a copy of of the final version for a young Christian friend who is dealing with cliquishness and even bullying at school. The book has a good chapter on bullying which is addressed to parents, but when I showed a few passages to the girl, she found  ""Heart Sisters"" to have a more literal interpretation of the Bible than she was accustomed to, and the book isn't really written for young people in particular.

There is a wealth of information about each region:  places to stay, restaurants, nightlife, museums, tours, festivals and other special events, and other  sights not to be missed, as well as travel information, numerous maps, and historical background. and interesting facts about the region being discussed.The early chapters include an excellent ""first time France"" section, a chapter on the  top 15 places to visit, a really helpful ""plan your trip"" chapter with regions ""at a glance""  and  suggestions of outdoor activity. The final chapters deal with history (fascinating!) cuisine, the arts, transportation, and even a brief guide to the French language - so much information to absorb while planning, dreaming, and  making decisions for a trip.My only reservation about the book is that it is thick (nearly two inches!) and heavy, and the print is quite small (4.5 star).. This book would be great for the planning stages, but not one to be easily carried while traveling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332ICYAUNE259/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743214707#wasThisHelpful","R332ICYAUNE259","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Make My Day Paris"" is attractive, packed with useful information, and compact enough to fit into a daypack or purse. The pages are made of card stock and scored, so that one can flip through them and view and combine ideas for morning, afternoon, and evening activity.  Maps including a transit map are provided. Each description of a place to visit includes ""must see's"" at that place, as well as suggestions places to dine in the area...also, most have a bit of historical background as well as useful information like hours of operation and basic facts. A ""Make my Day"" app can be downloaded for further information. I like the way the Eiffel tower has a different photo and description in the ""morning"" section than it does in the evening section. Some places to choose from:  museums, a bookstore, a hotel with a gorgeous ceiling, great places to shop,  concerts, operas, or dance performances, theater productions...as well as familiar landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Jardin des TuIleries, Champs Elysees, etc. etc. and of course, the Eiffel tower.Descriptions often give a bit of historical information as well as hours of operation and general information.This little book, and the London version made me want to plan a trip right now...when I do, I will appreciate the wealth of information found in this little book. It will be so helpful to go through the various ""mix and match"" options for planning each day.

"This is an engrossing collection of short stories. Some are about war and some about and art, sometimes merging together and sometimes separate. I was very taken with Rebecca Makkais ability to reveal the specifics of a story (time, place, people  involved, etc.) in gentle, gradually unfolding layers, each imparting  new shades of meaning. Make is also wonderfully adept at manipulating multiple threads, pulling them all together in ways that sometimes surprise the reader. Her writing is best described as gripping: sometimes dark and haunting, at other times, quirky and titillating, and often heartrending, moving, thought provoking. I like that she requires the reader to work a bit, filling in aspects of the story that she handles with such subtlety.Some of the stories are written in the most simple and direct language, while in others, the language is very florid and rich with detail. My favorite stories (I wont say which ones - no spoilers here!) were the darker ones. The first few in the collection drew me in immediately, but some of the stories that followed were so powerful that I closed the book to let it all just wash over me. A  few stories were less engaging, but I see that other readers liked those, so I wont comment further.All in all, this is an excellent collection, and makes for very satisfying reading. Rebecca Makkai is as skillful an author as she is imaginative. Highly recommended.

"n this book, author Jeremy Bloom tells about his impressive career as an Olympic skiier and NFL football player, his transition to a business career, and the ways he coped with some big disappointments and unwelcome changes along the way. I have read quite a few books about failure and building on lessons learned from tough experiences. On those subjects, this book didn't stand out as much as certain others did (""The Power of Failure"" by Charles C. Manz and ""Rebounders"" by Rick Newmanare some examples) though readers new to these ideas might find the book more inspiring. However, I was impressed by Bloom's descriptions of a positive, satisfying ""bottom up"" work culture, and the ideals of mutual respect, decency, trust, and accountability that he seems to aspire to in his company.Some of the topics Bloom discusses include  applying lessons learned  in a first career to a second one; intrinsic motivation over extrinsic; leadership styles; limiting the time spent mourning losses and mistakes; transparency on the job: staying humble despite success (what he calls ""productive paranoia"") and the deep satisfaction that comes from helping other people. I admire the work he is doing to help senior citizens by (1) giving to individual seniors and (2) encouraging respect for older people in our society. The last few chapters of this book offer some very touching moments.All in all, this is an uplifting book with many positive ideas.

"I have used various Omron pedometers over the years, and have found them to be quite accurate and reliable.I was excited to find this new product, the HJ-327T Alvita Wireless Activity Tracker. It is little and cute and seems nicely designed. Unfortunately, I have had many difficulties setting up this product and using it.Pairing has been a problem, and I had to remove the battery several times. I was surprised that I had to give personal information to the server in order to use this device locally. The instructions say to shake it a few times in any direction to activate it...I have had to jerk it pretty hard to get any response, and then it tends to shut down after a short time. Changing from screen to screen on the device sometimes works, but often not. After my first few tries, the step counter worked more accurately, which is great, but the connection between devices seems tenuous at best.I would be happy to just use the step counter, if that were easier to do, but alas, it is not, so, sadly enough, I think I will stick with my older Omron products.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHF6LPITUAIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVPNZ9Y#wasThisHelpful","RHF6LPITUAIU","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, Clark Elliott tells the harrowing story of his 8 year struggle with the debilitating symptoms of a severe concussion. He describes his symptoms in detail, and recounts stories of his attempts to make some sense out of what had happened to him. He tells of the challenges posed by things we take for granted: maintaining  balance, navigating stairs, walking, sleeping, etc., as well as the frustrations of  being tested and treated with standard medical procedures; being misunderstood by other people, including police, medical workers, and bystanders; retaining a full-time job as a tenured professor; and caring for children as a single parent.We learn what it is like to live with the need to stop everything frequently to let an injured brain recover from the simplest activities, and what it is like to know that at any moment the brain's ""batteries"" can wear out. He acquaints us with his careful study of his symptoms, sometimes quoting his copious notes. I admire his determination to find predictable patterns in what seemed so mysterious, and his wish to share his experiences in order that other concussion sufferers might know about the treatments that worked so well for him.Elliott writes in a very readable conversational style. Brain functions are described in very simple language. I was most impressed by his ability to explain delicate sensations and symptoms so articulately, and by his perseverance through such obstacles. My one reservation about the book is that so much of the text (about two thirds of the book) is devoted to the time before he got help. The later chapters about the treatment drew me in less, though the treatment itself is intriguing. Also, the earlier chapters get a bit repetitious, as he tells story after story of his difficult times and attempts to cope.Still, this is a fascinating book, which will appeal to readers interested in brain plasticity. This book also could be interesting to anyone who has had to find their own way out of a tough medical situation.

"n this book, authors John Kounios and Mark Beeman present an exploration of creativity and problem solving, focusing on those elusive sudden insights that be so stimulating and fullfilling. The authors identify two thinking styles: the insightful and analytic, explaining that most people tend toward one or the other, and probe into each of these. Some of the topics discussed include the stages of thinking that lead to the ""aha"" moment, what happens during the incubation phaseOne author is an expert on EEG testing, while the other is equally experienced with fMRI. Explanations of both of these are clear and illuminating, as are discussions of right and left brain contributions to creative thought. I enjoyed the chapters on the effects of rewards, deadlines, and such, as well as the nature of intuition, and motivation, and I particularly appreciated the suggestions for priming ourselves for more moments of insight. The authors illustrate their points with numerous stories of""eureka"" moments experienced by fascinating people. Just a few examples: Helen Keller, cancer researcher Judah Feldman, geneticist Barbara McClintock, one of Elvis's concert promoters, a Buddhist monk, and Archimedes himself.Throughout, the book is written in an easygoing, conversational, very readable style. Very entertaining as well as informative. My one reservation is that there was a fair amount of repetition of basic principles, but perhaps that makes them stay with us longer.

"I am really happy with these scissors and the nice little caddy that stores and presents them.  The scissors come in bright, cheery colors (The ones I received are pink, orange red, lime green, and turquoise.) They easily cut through paper, plastic wrap, yarn, and light fabric. I appreciate that the blades have ruler markings...great for crafts. The caddy is  handy and easy to toe around. Nice that the four containers can be removed for convenient distributing, and are washable. The scissors are comfortable in the hand and seem well made...nice that a name tag can be applied. Blades seem a bit sharp for a very young child. Still these scissors could be used for a children's craft class, and they will be great to have on hand around for evenings of needlework fun with adults as well as kids.

"These shopping bags are very high quality. They wash well (machine wash separately, cold water; dry on gentle cycle) (minimal ironing if used in a situation where that would matter) and though they are not as tall as paper shopping bags, they hold a fair amount of stuff - as much as the plastic bags I have been using will hold. The seams on these cloth bags are reinforced and the bottom of each can be folded out so that the bag will stand up. The bags are made of one long piece of canvas-y fabric, with no bottom seam. The handles seem to be sewn on (reinforced  with crisscrossed stitching )in a way that they won't come undone. I like the soft fabric used for the handles that will be easy on hands when the bag is full. Nice to have 3 different colors - easier to find them in the wash. I am tempted to pin a little zipped purse into the printed one and use it as a craft bag...really like the cheerful, well defined print. The description claims that each bag holds 30 pounds...I am not sure I would try that, but it's good to know that that may be possible.In short, these are well made, attractive, useful for all sorts of things, and (!) washable...all good!

"This is a very sharp looking, slim bottle in a very vibrant shade of blue. I like that it holds a full 20 oz. of liquid (directions say cold and not carbonated) and that it fits so easily into the outside pocket on my bag. I wanted something leakproof, and when it functions properly, this one is very leakproof when it is closed. However, I have had trouble locking the top into place (button is very stiff and resistant to pushing to the side) and the top on my bottle does occasionally pop open on its own.I have found that the bottle definitely does keep water icy cold overnight. It is too bad that the bottle is not to be used with hot beverages...one more thing to remember about this bottle as opposed to the other Contigo bottles (Contigo Snapseal Vacuum-Insulated Stainless Steel Travel Mug) I own. It's best to wash the top in the dishwasher, because otherwise the directions advise soaking it in hot soapy water for as long as 15 minutes...another things to remember.The only other concern I have about this bottle is that it is a bit hard to use it when driving because of its length. Also, I prefer the smaller opening for drinking that the other Contigo bottles have...less risk of spilling. Nice that the bottle is BPA free and has a guarantee.OVerall, this could be a fine product if the top could be locked in place more easily, and if it weren't limited in the ways listed above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7OPCEZ1A454/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX8JM#wasThisHelpful","R3H7OPCEZ1A454","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is in so many ways a beautiful book. David Hawkins begins with very strong, convincing writing about the regrettable damage that anger and resentment can do to a relationship. He writes with great sensitivity and directness about couples he was worked with as well as his own marriage. There are no promises of instant cures - no lists of cognitive distortions; no suggested scripts; no 3 or 5 or 7 steps to complete peace, etc.Instead, he pleads with us to open our hearts and minds to the people we care about the most, in order to grow in empathy and understanding, help each other get needs met, and heal any hurts, present and past. In Dawkins's words: ""Brooding and consuming resentment have no place in  an open heart, and (italics) an opening your heart is the only way to healing. Resentment is narrow an divisive - intimacy is the opposite...Resentment keeps us locked in our belief that we are right (self-righteousness!) and have a right to resent our mates. ..if we are to open our hearts, we must let go of resentment and see our mates as being wounded as we are, as needing healing as much as we need it.""Dawkins goes on to discuss what he calls ""accurate empathy...the greatest elixir to end fighting  forever"" and the need for each partner, get grounded in what he calls one's core self before discussing troubling issues...to ease into those subjects, so that both parties calm down in the process. He advises that couples be on the alert for escalating tension and defensiveness that can signal the inevitable setbacks that can come unbidden. He supplies numerous quotes from other writers on this subject; notably John Gottman, who has done such wonderful work with couples.While there could be more specific suggestions for working on a relationship (4.5 stars) I really appreciate Dawkins's gentle, caring approach and his intimate, conversational style in this very readable book. Though it is listed as a Christian book, aside from occasional biblical quotes, there is very little reference to a particular religion here, and the principles he is espousing seem universal.Another brief passage to ponder: ""Herein lies the magic: When we talk to each other from our true, best self, rather than the angry, protective part of ourselves, we are likely to hook the best self of our mate. When we speak from our best selves, we are calm, clear and concise...from this emotional place we discover that kindness begets kindness.""Easy to say and sometimes hard to do, as Dawkins acknowledges. Still, he encourages us to hold the ideal and do our best as imperfect human beings. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAUI5F2WY98C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426773854#wasThisHelpful","R2AAUI5F2WY98C","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, psychologist Charles E. Dodgen tells of his work in a nursing home, and gleans 28 lessons that might be taken from his experience there. Originally intended to be a guide for those working in nursing homes, the book is divided into 28 chapters, each focusing on a particular lesson or theme. Each chapter is followed by a brief section entitled ""Applying this lesson to your life,"" with suggestions for further thought and action. In the final chapter, Dodgen summarizes each lesson, highlighting key points for additional study and thought.Here is a quote from the book: (p. 24) ""These universal truths about life and humanity, gleaned from experiences in the microcosm of the nursing home, can be employed to guide behavior in our incredibly complex, full-speed, everyday lives. My book is about a developing a positive life at any stage. It is not a book about the elderly or nursing home resident per se...the elderly are the same as anybody else. The aged person as discussed my book is you, me, and the child next door; she may be...living under different conditions...but is dealing with the same basic challenges. The solutions employed to great benefit in the nursing home can be used successfully by anybody.""Some of the subjects Dodgen explores include grief as opposed to depression and demoralization; the universal importance of love; responsibility for one's health at any age; ways to create better habits; the plasticity of the brain and our ability to benefit from that; the process of adjustment to major life changes like entering a nursing home; the healing power of true empathy; our need for friends and family; and the search for the silver lining in a tough situation. I especially appreciated the chapters on changing one's attitude and making positive changes in baby steps, and resisting the impulse to overreact to upsetting situations by pausing to calm down. He also discusses the importance of spiritually fulfilling activities like meditation, focusing on gratitude, spending time of nature, etc., and he encourages us to work through crises and losses by filling our days with new interests, social interaction, etc. He instructs us on ways to both give and receive loving care.There is so much positive energy in this book. Dodge write with sensitivity and compassion. Some of the lessons will be very familiar to those who have read self help books, while other lessons are more unusual. Recommended to readers who seek to understand the far end of our life cycle, and who are interested in a self help book with a different approach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQ1DBBB3NJ0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880168#wasThisHelpful","R1IQ1DBBB3NJ0B","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, anthropolgist/social worker Jorja Leap tells the story of her work coleading a group for fathers in Watts, Los Angeles, over a period of years. Leap, who had worked with Father Greg Boyle of Homeboy Industries, gives a sense of what it is like to grow up in Watts, and the formidable challenges one might face: lack of employment (especially after incarceration), young children to support, complex love and parenting relationships; the temptation to use drugs, or to sell them to support children; tensions between ethnic groups; gang related violence at times; police barreling in to control crises and in so doing creating deeper schisms between groups; disproportionate numbers of people of color in the criminal justice system; big promises by politicians that come to nothing; budget and funding struggles; etc.Leap also highlights some of the positive sides of things: support of large, extended families; the men's  desire and determination to give their children what they themselves were denied;  and the men's slowly deepening devotion to the Project Fatherhood group, as the men bonded with each other, eventually not only supporting their own children with more understanding and empathy, also but reaching out to help other young people in the community.

"In this book, Carla Powers does exactly what the title promises: she tells about her studies of the Quran with Sheikh Mohammed Akram Nadwi, a scholar of Islam, ""extremist quietist,"" and longtime friend. Some of the topics covered include some history of Islam; the meaning of the titles, ""Islam"" ""Muslim,"" the wide range  of interpretations of the Quran and other texts; distinguishing between customs defined by local tradition vs. those dictated by the Prophet in the Quran; the issue of identity; true piety vs. going through the motions of religious observance; the meaning of ""jihad"" and other words that we hear in the news; Islam's relationship with other religions; salvation after death; extremist groups and their beliefs; and so on. Women's issues are discussed at great length, as Powers draws distinctions between what customs are practiced today and what the sheikh believes was done in earlier days, perhaps by the Prophet himself. A chapter is devoted to the sheikh's research on nine thousand women who were highly respected for their knowledge and wisdom through the ages. Other issues covered include education for women, veiling, separation from men in religious observances and other events, family relationships, and child marriage. Powers shares her own complex feelings about these subjects with us, and writes with sensitivity and candor. I really appreciate the glossary she provides, as well as the end notes and bibliography that suggest more fascinating books  than one could ever get to.My one disappointment was that the the title led me to expect more verse by verse discussion of the Quran. However, other books listed in the bibliography seem to fulfill that need.I recognize that this book really centers around the work of one Islamic scholar. Still, I found the book engrossing, informative, very readable, and hard to put down.

"This tank top is quite lightweight and open; great for summer. I really like the crisscrossed back straps. The  fabric is quite porous, which I imagine will make it more comfortable (cooler) in a workout than polyester sometimes is. I received the charcoal gray (Storm) color, which is quite muted and would go with a wide range of other shades. The top part is clearly intended to fit snugly; mine is a bit loose. The rest of the shirt is quite loose fitting and slightly flared at the hemline - a nice line to wear over pants, leggings, etc., and comfortable in hot, muggy weather. When I first unpacked the shirt, it had an odd smell, which washed out completely. No problems with washing and drying the shirt in the machine on a low setting.Because the top is quite porous and its armholes are cut very wide and hang low, one would expect to wear something under this top. The fabric feels slightly stretchy and the straps are soft elastic. The fabric is not as soft as some, but comfortable none the less.  All in all, this is a nice looking top and easy to care for.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9DY1PWZ0BX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO2JH1A#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9DY1PWZ0BX4","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have enjoyed listening to David Brooks and Mark Shields haggle things out on the PBS news hour, and find both of them keen, articulate, and as knowledgable as they are witty. In this book, Brooks traces the cultural change from the model of ""little me"" (based on what he refers to as ""moral realism"") to that of the ""big me"" which is prevalent today, and the current overemphasis on qualities for external success and self-promotion (""Adam I,"") rather than the more subtle values that help us get along with each other, bounce back from adversity and learn from it, and lead more satisfying lives (""Adam II"").To illustrate his point, Brooks examines the lives of many prominent people, presenting accounts of their lives and the prevailing attitudes of the time. I found appreciated the chapter on civil rights activists A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin to be particularly stimulating. Sometimes Brooks's main point is a bit obscured by the rich detail he provides in these chapters. The final chapter,""The Big Me,"" is the book's crowning glory. Brooks elaborates eloquently on his basic idea, and provides a ""humility code"" which I found both practical and inspiring.Though some of the biographical chapters made for slow reading, I found this book extremely satisfying, and will be returning to it periodically. Brooks's ideas brought to mind two other books: Martin Buber's ""I and Thou"" (corresponding somewhat to the concepts of Adam I and Adam II ) and David McCullough's more recent ""You are Not Special.""Brooks ends his introductory chapter with these words: ""These are the people who have built a strong inner character, who have achieved a certain depth. In these people, the climb to success is surrendered to the struggle to deepen the soul. After a life of seeking balance, Adam I has bowed down to Adam II. These are the people we are looking for.""Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FPZO3FYY6IOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R3FPZO3FYY6IOK","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, Amy Kittleston traces the changes of belief and attitude that unfolded from about the mid eighteenth century on, as free thinkers challenged the beliefs of Calvinism and became more open to the idea that other cultures, traditions, and even religions might have some validity, and questioned the relationship to the nature, people, and the deity.  She devotes each chapter to one of seven important people, some known to us and some less known, who were influential in this gradual evolution: John Adams, Mary Moody Emerson (aunt of Ralph Waldo), William Ellery Channing, William James, Thomas Davidson, William Mackintire Salter, and Jane Addams. She often digresses to discuss other fascinating people at great length, sometimes spending several pages on them in the midst of a chapter about someone eIse. In this manner we learn about Alexis de Tocqueville, Samuel Butler, John Stuart Mill, Walt Whitman, August Comte, William Wordsworth, and others. While all of this is engrossing, it is sometimes hard to follow the basic narrative. Sometimes Kittleston gives us so much background information that it almost seems as if this one book could have been several.Much as I enjoyed reading about the changes in peoples relationship to religion, the people she discussed, the various ways in which they interacted, and the increased attention to racial equality, womens rights and similar issues, I found this a slow read, and one that demands a fair amount of work from the reader. I intend to go back and reread sections of the book with fresh attention. Still, there is much to learn and ponder here. Recommended to readers willing to keep a very steady focus throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBHPMXI5LKKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204853#wasThisHelpful","RFBHPMXI5LKKM","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like other DK books I have read, this book is beautifully done, presenting a vast amount of potentially confusing information with surprisingly few words and lots of eye-catching graphics.  I have greatly enjoyed working my way through, page by page, absorbing new ideas and gaining a deeper perspective on this complex subject. I really appreciate the creative ways the authors break down and represent difficult concepts. The book has four main sections: ""How Companies Work,"" ""How Finance Works,"" ""How Sales and Marketing Works, and ""How Operations and Production Work."" Each smaller section (often 2 pages)  offers its own ""How it Works"" paragraph and often a ""Need to Know"" sidebar. Case studies are also presented.  Here is an example of the way material is broken down: the section on ""Financial Reporting"" starts with a general explanation, followed by ""Types of Financial reports,""  a brief description of the eight steps of the accounting cycle, presented in detail on the following two pages), a section on ""the annual Report,"" ""Types of Accounting,"" (seven of them) and ""Financial Statements:"" 6 questions answered, followed by brief answers and references to other pages that give further information. All of this is attractively laid out on two pages. I was fascinated by the sections about collecting and warehousing consumer data, as well as the sections about production (batch, flow, continuous - learned something about papermaking) and new product development.This is a gorgeous book and a valuable one. It would make an ideal gift - great for young people;. It  is a terrific reference and a wonderful coffee table book...so satisfying, whether read systematically or just thumbed through. Most highly recommended to readers wishing to learn more, and enjoy doing so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L535FNHLE1X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465429794#wasThisHelpful","R1L535FNHLE1X8","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice assortment of fine chocolates. They come attractively packaged, and would make a nice gift. I appreciate the fact that they are long (about two and a half inches) and thin and scored in the middle, which makes it easier to save half of each for later in moments of self-restraint. Serious chocolate lovers might especially enjoy the chocolate mousse flavor as well as the dark cream...especially smooth,  rich and satisfying. The coffee and cream flavor has a very strong coffee flavor and a white chocolate layer on the bottom. The hazelnut chocolate is just a bit overly sweet for my taste. Milk chocolate is used in three of these; dark chocolate in the rest. The calorie count is about what one would expect. I love the creamy texture. They arrived in perfect condition. They look elegant enough for entertaining.

"In this book, Jia Jiang confronts his fear of rejection and consequent embarrassment, and shares his developing insights into the process with us along the way. It was interesting to read about his growing objectivity about rejection, and his realization that so often the circumstances in which we are turned down for something are really so much more complex than they might appear. I appreciate his willingness to put himself in uncomfortable and sometimes ridiculous situations and to blush a little, and I especially appreciate his ability to learn from disappointments, using these experiences to become stronger, wiser, and more understanding of other people and the world. This is a quick and easy read, though some readers may prefer to linger and absorb the lessons presented here.Many of Jia Jiang's conclusions align perfectly with common sense, and many of the concepts presented will be familiar to readers who have read self help books. For that reason, this book may appeal most to readers just starting out in life. Also, the kinds of risks that he took are for the most part so unrelated to real work issues that it is hard to take them very seriously. Still, the author makes some interesting points, often with humility and a nice dose of self-effacing humor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KQ74M9T37ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080414138X#wasThisHelpful","R9KQ74M9T37ZP","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I  thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about the life of Indra Devi, the times she lived in, the places she lived and worked, her wide range of abilities, the fascinating people she met, and the growth of interest in India and eastern religion, as well as the origin and development of yoga in its various versions and stages. The book is packed with information about Ms. Devi's unusual life and the many intriguing people she interacted with during her long (just short of 103 years). Michelle Goldberg states from the introductory chapter that she writes as an admirer rather than a believer, and her slightly cynical stance on the romanticized view of India that has been popular over several generations may surprise some readers.  However, I appreciate the thoroughness of her research and her efforts to dispel popular myths, particularly about hatha yoga practices. I especially enjoyed her frequent digressions from Devi's life story: we learn about the birth and growth of the Theosophical movement and the lives of Mme. Blavatsky and Annie Besant, as well as the life of Krishnamurti, from the time he was discovered as a young boy. Goldberg also tells us about the many important people Devi met, including Rabindanath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, Sai Baba, and so many other influential people like B.K.S. Iyengar, Yehudi Menuhin, and Pattabhi Jois. Goldberg also tells something about the political situation in all of the many places where Devi lived and worked. It was intriguing to follow Indra Devi through so many tages, and to learn a bit more about the situations faced by women through those years.  Goldberg tries to give an objective view of Devi's life and her character, highlighting her positive energy and dedication to her cause as well as her very human imperfections.""The Goddess Pose"" will be most satisfying to readers looking for a more objective look at yoga and mysticism, the emergence of new age philosophies, and the life of Indra Devi. Though this is not the quickest read due to the amount of information Goldberg manages to convey, there is much to enjoy here, much to wonder at (some real surprises!) and much to return to for further thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VX42UU5K56E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307593517#wasThisHelpful","R28VX42UU5K56E","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this very interesting book, Kate Bolick explores the longstanding questions faced by women through the ages, and the ways that interpretation of these questions has changed over time. Some of the conflicts that she discusses at length include marriage vs. staying single; ongoing companionship vs. solitude; shared decision making vs. autonomy; financial independence vs. joining forces with another person; the push to acquire possessions vs. living a more spartan life; being defined by a job vs. living and working completely on one's own terms, etc. She repeatedly comes back to the strong urge for self-determination, living by her own compass, savoring the beauty of being alone, and remaining true to her overriding desire to write. Still, she doesn't hide from us the many ups and downs she experienced, including some periods of confusion, self-doubt, regret, and at times, painful depression.Throughout the book, Bolick refers to her 5 ""awakeners:"" strong female writers who, though they did not live as spinsters all of their lives, lived by their own ideals, going against the norms of their time. She devotes portions of a chapter to each of these women, and also refers to numerous other fascinating, bold, freethinking women along the way.  Because the early edition I read lacks a list of sources or endnotes, I found myself jotting down titles and authors of books she discusses here and there.I especially appreciate the historical information Bolick provides, particularly concerning the three decades of change leading up to 1920, when women finally acquired the right to vote.  My one reservation about the book is that Bolick's detailed stories about her love life sometimes cause things to slow down a bit, particularly in the early chapters. When she finally writes about her fascinating study the ""awakeners"" and its effects on her life, the pace definitely picks up. I found last two chapters  especially powerful, riveting, and often inspiring.So though the first chapters may give a misleading impression of the real content of the book, ""Spinster"" is  definitely worth reading;  most thought-provoking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368RU8UM2MVAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347138#wasThisHelpful","R368RU8UM2MVAZ","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""The Caregiver's Companion,""  Carolyn A. Brent tells us of her experiences caring for her elderly father in his years of illness and his unfortunate struggles with dementia. Brent has collected a formidable amount of very valuable advice gleaned from her own struggles, and she shares it here in a well-organized and extremely useable format. Each chapter of the book provides good, practical information and advice, followed by questions to be asked of oneself and others when decisions need to be made, or when things change.  Brent gives a realistic description of the various physical emotional, and financial demands that often arise in caring for an ailing loved one. A few topics covered in the book include the decision to take an ailing relative into one's home; how that decision affects the life of the caregiver; the challenges of choosing and paying for longterm care;  communicating with relatives who may not be cooperative; being prepared for emergencies; end of life issues and the various documents that need to be in place to support the patient; and the supreme importance of taking care of oneself throughout, in order to maintain a good quality of life and also give better support to the relative. I especially appreciate the chapters on crucial emotional, financial, and legal conversations to have with the patient and as a family. Lists of very helpful services and are provided at the end of the book. Throughout, Brent's love for her father are apparent, as are her compassion for others facing these challenges and her insight into the best ways to proceed.The book ends with a ""cheat sheet"" for caregivers, summarizing the most important considerations for all concerned.This book is an extremely valuable source of information, comfort, and support.  Brent repeats main points often, making it less necessary to read the entire book, though I found it extremely useful to do so. The only reservation when reading it was that I found it hard to read about her personal struggles with her siblings, though I a sure that her story could be helpful to others facing similar situations.Most highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVC7S8CM55GR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373893094#wasThisHelpful","RVC7S8CM55GR8","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are strong, flexible bags, and I like the silver ties. The bags are nice and tall, and a bit stretchy. I tried filling it to the top and scrunching it all down, and the bag held up really well. I put lawn wate with lots of sharp edges into the bag, and there were no punctures or tears from contact with those sharp twigs, thorns, etc. The bags can be stretched over the rim of a trashcan, and can therefore fit different shapes of cans.  (The box claims that they are puncture resistant - seems to be true.The one thing I am less thrilled about is the fragrance...perhaps it helps mask odors, but I find it quite perfumy and unforunately, a bit physically irritating.  I had hoped to use these bags for storage of some craft materials, but don't want my yarn etc. to take on that perfumy scent.  People who a light fragrance will be very happy with these bags.

"I am very impressed with the thought and insight and careful planning that obviously went into this program of study for the GED. The explanations of the program, pretests, online videos and other resources, practice tests, and copious instruction are well organized, making the material accessible and self-monitoring easier. The course covers four major subject areas: Reasoning through Language Arts, Mathematical Reasoning, Social Studies, and Science, which is divided into sections for LIfe Science, Earth and Space Science, and Physical Science. Each of these four subjects begins with a detailed explanation of the test for that subject. I am impressed with the vast range of material covered by the book, and am really enjoying making my way through it. The online materials are excellent, and help the student get organized and keep from getting overwhelmed.This is a terrific resource for study. Though the ideal situation would be to be part of a class, or work with a tutor, particularly for the math test, this Kaplan book and online materials can be used as a terrific supplementary guide. This program may appeal to younger students who would like to have a preview of high school material as well as  older adults interested in revisiting and reviewing these subjects.

"This book offers a fascinating and detailed exploration of the workings of the brain, related to human behavior;  specifically, to anxiety and depression.The layout of the book is appealing, and makes complex information accessible. There are lots of sidebars entitled ""Neuroscience"" in which Arden probes more deeply into the areas of the brain and their function and interaction. Other sidebars entitled  ""Client Education""  provide well worded explanations and suggestions for explaining these concepts to clients. The book concludes with a long and intriguing list of references, an index of authors cited, and a general index. Also, at the end of the text of the book (p. 223, there is a list of the many abbreviations used in the body of the book - good to know about before one starts to read. Key concepts are simplified and underscored by various acronyms.This book is a wonderful resource, useful in so many ways: to expand one's own knowledge of brain function; to better understand the two sided relationship between brain and behavior; and to reassure clients and encourage them to step out of their comfort zones take steps to make their lives better. I find it admirable that the author's underlying purpose is to somehow ""find common denominators among therapy types"" and offer a brain-based approach that ""discards the purely theory driven cul-de-sacs based only on the tight confines of a particular school,"" thus eliminating confusing fads based on conflicting theories. There are lots of multimultisyllable words (My favorites: ""geniculohypothalamic"" and psychneuroimmunological"") but when necessary, good explanations are given throughout. I could not put the book down.John Arden has written several self-help books based on similar material for the lay reader. ""Brain2Brain"" is written for therapists, but could be useful for teachers and others with a strong interest in the inner workings of the brain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDQFO04310US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118756886#wasThisHelpful","R2LDQFO04310US","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did; in fact, in many ways, I love this book, and recommend it to anyone new in business. Daniel Lubetsky does a fine job of analyzing what it takes to grow a business with the values and goals of Kind and his other pursuits: the philosophy of AND; the fervent desire to treat everyone decently, encourage and support acts of kindness stay accountable and open with all concerned, and even bring together people from conflicting groups in the process. Above all, I really admire his willingness to share both his successes and his most regrettable mistakes. In fact, that is where the book shines the most, as he tells us to ""celebrate"" every failure and doggedly learn from it.I also was moved by  his determination to emulate his Holocaust survivor father, who passed away suddenly some years ago. Some of Lubetzky's writing is so moving that I took it into quiet meditation, in order to fully absorb his ideas. I love his commitment to taking the high road, aspiring to high ideals, while still attending to the necessity to be financially successful. What a breath of fresh air, considering how greed without direction or guiding principles seems to affect every aspect of life today.My own reservation about this book is that there is a fair amount of repetition.

"This is an outstanding product: sleek, easy to maneuver, and very quiet. I really like the overall design, and I much prefer the canister shape of this vacuum to the heavier upright models I have owned in the past. The attachments fit so nicely into the unit itself, without constantly falling out (as they did in an old vacuum I used to have) and I love the way the cord is concealed in the unit, and is so easy to pull out and retract.It's great that there are 6 settings to experiment with. The vacuum works quite well on my old low pile carpet on a low suction setting, though I had to experiment a little to get it to work smoothly.  I like the long stainless steel wand and ample cord...so nice not to have to stop and change outlets constantly...I can plug it in in a central place, and progress down the hall vacuuming adjacent rooms. That alone cuts down on the dread of vacuuming and temptation to procrastinate. Cleaning is a pleasure with the three included attachments...it's easy to get under things and behind things and into little spaces, and deal with cat hair and upholstery and  dust. Changing the bag is very easy. The light is a nice extra...I was surprised by how helpful it is at certain times of day, though I had to get used to the timed fadeout.The only reservations I have are that it appears that the Miele bags are quite expensive, and that the vacuum itself is much more expensive than any vacuum I have considered buying in the past. However, it seems to be very sturdily made, and by a very reputable company.  I like to do a quick cleanup of well traveled areas in my work space fairly frequently. That is easily done with this vacuum cleaner.

"In this  well researched book, Sandy Tolan presents a  vivid picture of life in the occupied territories of Israel over the past decades. He states outright at the beginning that he is writing from the Palestinian point of view, and presents blow by blow accounts of wars, insurgencies, attempts at negotiation, disappointments, and seemingly endless strikes and retaliations. We learn what it is like for children to live amid checkpoints, armed soldiers on guard, an 8 meter separation wall, suicide bombings, etc. etc. We read about these children hurling stones from rooftops and losing relatives to violence and imprisonment. We also gain insight about infighting among various groups, national and international boycotts, UN and American involvement, etc. etc.In the midst of all of this, we also learn about the fine work of a young man named Ramji who established a music school and related programs in various locations in order to bring music (and hence, joy and perhaps even a measure of security) to Palestinian children. We follow Ramji to the US and to France as he gains a musical education, and we meet Edward Said and his wife, Marian as well as Daniel Barenboim, who founded an orchestra made up of 40 Israeli Jews, 40 Arab musicians (very few Palestinians) and 20 Spanish players. Ramji's growing frustration with the occupation opens us to a deeper perspective on this very complex subject.There is a great deal if information here, but for the first half or so of the book, I really wished Tolan would invite us into the hearts and minds of these young musicians, both Palestinians and Jews, to help understand how they really felt about other; how much they knew about each other; and whether they were able to listen to each other, truly empathize and learn from each other, and so on. We hear very little of this for a long, long time. At one point a mixed group of students takes a tour of Buchenwald. We are not told anything about the reactions of the students of either side. When we finally do hear more about the inner lives of these young people, it is fascinating, illuminating, and very moving, though it is clear that there is very deep pain and sensitivity on both sides.There are some very beautiful and uplifting moments in this book, but the overall effect is shocking, horrifying and very sad, especially considering the desparation faced by both groups in the past and the intensity of their reactions today. There is much to ponder here about human nature; attachment to land, belief, and tradition; threats to our security and our knee jerk reactions; the immense challenges of getting along; and what music can and cannot do to help us endure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHO4EE96557V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608198138#wasThisHelpful","R3KHO4EE96557V","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very  sturdy little product, and feels more substantial than a similar one made by Polder. The TimeStick seems to be water resistant, whereas the Polder gets completely thrown off it comes anywhere near moisture, and if it gets too wet, it dies completely. The TimeStick comes in fabulous colors, and I think the cord is better quality.However, there are some other considerations with the TimeStick. First, the buttons are hard to push, and second, harder to see, which gave an elderly relative trouble. Third, the alarm is actually louder than the Polder that I own (which is a year or two old and has had a great deal of use) which is bothersome to others in the vicinity. Fourth  the TimeStick costs twice as much as the Polder.Considering how delicate the Polder is (the piece of plastic that holds the battery in place needs to be reinforced with tape, or the battery can easily be lost) and how often they need to be replaced, the TimeStick is a better buy, unless the things listed above are problematic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367HPX5OQSJ40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ2DVIG#wasThisHelpful","R367HPX5OQSJ40","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are good strings with a nice strong, even sound. I especially like the D, which is warm and resonant, and particularly, the A, which has a richness that I have been looking for for quite a while. I like is better than the Larsen or the Jargar A strings, which seem to be favorites with lots of people these days.These new strings don't seem to need a long breaking in period, unlike some other D'Addario strings I have tried; the Kaplans stayed quite well in tune and sounded beautiful from the time I put them on. I am a just a little bit less thrilled with the G (not quite as focused) and C (seems a tiny bit muted) than with the upper two strings; perhaps with more vigorous playing, they will open up a little. I am curious to see if the overall sound will change over the first weeks of playing...will report back if it does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GU0VBELOWF5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQBT52W#wasThisHelpful","R1GU0VBELOWF5V","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has much to offer that is positive, uplifting, and above all, particularly sensitive to the needs of young people as they face the challenges of growing up in today's hectic society. So much resonated deeply: the idea of encouraging young people to develop a strong, reliable inner compass and a well-established ""command central'"" as well as a set of consistent values that they can use as a foundation for decision making; a strong sense of self and their role in society; and the courage to stand up for what they know is right.  I also appreciate her attention to individuation, the brain's process of maturation (explained in simple, direct language) and especially, her concept of the process of growing up as a spiritual search. There are many beautiful passages to highlight and reflect on at length. Her lists of ""Six Spiritual Strengths""and ""Seven RIght Things: Opportunities for Spiritual Parenting"" will certainly be helpful for many families.There is so much good in this book, but there were also some perplexing aspects to it all. First of all, the use of the word ""spiritual.""  She quotes people saying ""Children are spiritual..."" ""I'm not religious, but I'm a very spiritual person..."" and so on, but doesn't really define what she means in those contexts. ""Spiritual"" can mean everything from taking a weekly yoga class to trying with all of one's strength to evolve and conquer negative habits, to feeling strongly aligned with something greater than oneself, to being part of an extremist group, perhaps with questionable values. Her early definitions are extremely broad, opening the door to people who have very strong beliefs as well as people who love nature, but don't care for much more structure than that. However, later on in the book, she says emphatically, more that once, that in order to receive the benefits of being spiritual, young people must have a two way relationship with a higher power, in which there is give and take; communication. That is quite different from her earlier definition, and could be confusing to some readers and even discouraging to others.Also, Dr. Miller really doesn't have much to give to people who have been in some way disillusioned by religion, perhaps because the faith they grew up with didn't align what they read, heard, saw, felt, etc. in school and the world around them. While she encourages such people not to hesitate to provide some kind of spiritual substance for their children, she doesn't acknowledge the fact that some young people run away from religion - and therefore, spirituality - either because what they were taught as a child just doesn't make sense to them as adults, or in  more extreme cases, because they were actually hurt in some way by being part of that group or by the people involved. I wish she had offered some kind of encouragement for young people in these situations.Still, there is much good in ""The Spiritual Child,"" and I admire and respect Dr. Miller's efforts to understand and reach out to young people. However, I felt throughout the book that she is providing us with a sense of the ideal here, while real life is complex, and individual situations vary enormously. Recommended, though, for good ideas that stimulate constructive thought and above all, promote empathy and compassion as we guide young people through those challenging years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4OGCIP2IWPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125003292X#wasThisHelpful","R1F4OGCIP2IWPM","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the book (I think it may be his 17th) Derwald Wing Sue analyzes the problems that arise when people try to discuss racial issues. He devotes the first two thirds or so of the book going over the basic fears encountered in these talks; defensive reactions, different communication styles;  tensions between various groups; the lack of awareness that can generate anger and other disruptive defensive reactions; and so much more. He repeats his points many times. He begins each chapter with examples of discussions of race that did not go well, and he analyzes exactly what went wrong, and what was most likely going on inside the participants. These examples and his interpretations are fascinating and sometimes eye opening.Well into the book, Sue calls upon people (particularly white people) to embark upon a deep self-examination of their attitudes toward race, and any background influences from media, other people, etc. that  could have had an effect on them from early childhood. He emphasizes that beyond initial acceptance, guilt and extreme, ongoing self-blame are neither helpful nor constructive in improving empathy and communication.  He presents a 7 stage series of phases people  pass through to free themelves from negative condition, backing this up with 5 useful guidelines for taking action to become a nonracist, and ultimately, an antiracist. All of this is particularly directed toward parents and teachers, though everyone else is urged to take on this process.The final chapter of the book presents an example of a successful workshop discussion in which the teacher very skillfully manages a challenging situation. The book concludes with 5 ineffective strategies for encouraging dialogue, followed by 11 effective strategies.There is much to contemplate  and  work with here. This is not an easy, comfy read, but the steps listed in the last third of the book (which may not make as much sense without the information in the first two thirds) are most valuable. Recommended, with encouragement to keep reading, because readers may find that the last sections of the book bring it all together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFIHX9LHVFZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118958721#wasThisHelpful","R3PFIHX9LHVFZU","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several sets of Avery dividers, and I have to say that I like these the best. There are 8 numbered dividers plus 24 lettered (A, B, and C) for subcategories, as well as a table of contents page. Like so many Avery products, they seem quite durable, with extra reinforcement in the vulnerable places. I love the bright colors (even purple!) and even the feel of the paper, which is quite stiff and therefore may outlast flimsier competitors. The letters and numbers are big enough to be read easily, and can be arranged in either landscape or portrait mode.But what I like most about these is the range of possible uses...first, for organizing work presentations, this is great. I could see building a presentation over time with this system, researching and adding categories and subcategories, but there are so many other ways these dividers could be helpful, particularly for any project that one would preplan with an outline. Work projects, home projects, tax stuff, school subjects, crafts, exercise workout sheets...not to mention writing projects (there's a novel here waiting to be written!) I found a video on Youtube entitled ""Avery Ready Index Table of Contents"" that shows in simple detail how to print on the table of contents page.This is a very useful and attractive and most likely, durable product.

"In this book, author Nancy Abrams tells of her spiritual search as she faced the challenges of an eating disorder. Ultimately, her work on the 12 steps of anonymous programs inspired her to find a concept of a higher power that has been both inspirational and effective in her life. Her book is her presentation of her spiritual ideas to the world at large.In the chapters entitled ""A God that Can't be Real"" and""A God that Could be Real"" Abrams tells us exactly who or what God as she understand it is and is not. (She uses the neutral pronoun unless she is discussing more traditional views of God, in which case she uses ""He, Him,"" etc.) Her conception of this higher power is somehow reflected in the sum total of human aspirations, past, present, and future, from the events leading to the Big Bang into the most distant future. She emphasizes oneness with all of humanity, past and future as well as present. In all of this, she cultivates an attitude of fellowship with and appreciation for humanity as a whole, stressing responsibility and accountability in protecting and even saving our planet.  She provides some historical background and scientific information about the cosmos centering around the concept of emergence. She concludes with some very beautiful writing about these subjects, particularly relating to environmental issues, and culminating with 10 promises to focus on for a brighter future (somewhat akin to the promises widely circulated in 12 step programs).There are some beautiful things here, and the ultimate purpose of humanity saving itself from the catastrophies of climate change is a noble and crucial one. However, to get to the sense of a higher power that she is promoting, one has to pass through some pretty stringent and even hard-line reasoning processes, perhaps geared more to the philosopher of science (her description of herself in her bio at her website) than the average person, who may prefer or need to keep things simple. People who fled at an early age from dogmatic belief systems (whether religious or atheistic) may find that there is too much hard mental work involved to embrace Abrams's system of thought and belief. Still, in the spirit of Archbishop Tutu's beautiful introduction, reading this book does help one to enrich one's understanding of these vast and fathomless areas of thought.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8OYOI1Z9J9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807073393#wasThisHelpful","RP8OYOI1Z9J9S","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, Robert Wachter provides a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and complications of computerization across the gamut of medical care.He gives us a thorough history of the medical record (actually, the state and interpretation of the medical record (an ongoing topic throughout the narrative) and how it evolved as the medical field changed. He lets us in on medical billing practices used by insurance companies in paying doctors (an eyeopener!) he tells us what computers can and cannot do; he muses about ways that use of technology changes our behavior; he tells us about various systems (examples: Epic and Athena) in use and their costs and benefits,; he talks about the ""productivity paradox"" and blind trust of wrong information when it is displayed on a sophisticated and expensive machine;  and he laments the fact that medical professionals are more rushed than ever (partly because of the effects of technology) and often have their attention more on the computer screen than on their patients. In the most gripping part of the book, spanning several chapters, he recounts in detail the events leading up to a hideous medical error.In preparing to write this book, Wachter interviewed 100 highly qualified experts (their credentials are listed in a table at the end of the book) and he often quotes them  He writes about issues concerning interoperability, useability, learnability (didn't know that was a word!) privacy, and the general clumsiness of systems that don't quite fit the job they are supposed to perform. He often draws comparisons between the challenges for medical care and those for aviation, which have striking parallels.Again and again, Wachter concludes that the best solutions involve humans and computers working together, and perhaps the biggest challenge is for the human side to adapt to the needs of technology. He cites examples of government sponsored programs that have basically failed because the human beings involved were not prepared to to use them effectively.Despite or perhaps in addition to all of this, Wachter assures us he is not a Luddite, and is not pushing for a return to paper and such. He provides his own ideal vision (""Nirvana,"" he calls it) for the future, in which technology would be used more efficiently and effectively. All of this makes for a fascinating and thought provoking read, with a few shocks and bumps along the way.

The sub-dividers (3, labeled A, B, and C for each numbered tab) will be extremely handy - for work presentations and other ongoing projects, for stray papers waiting to be filed, for  household routines, for keeping craft instructions organized, and for keeping any runaway papers in order...so nice for those of us who like to think in outline form (and to color code).

"This is a nice looking stapler, and takes up less desk space than other staplers I have used. It seems to be sturdily made, and I love the color (easier to spot on the desktop).

The top opens easily for loading and the stapler fits in the hand comfortably. I was able to staple through 25 pages, though the staples that came with it were a bit short for that, and i had to use a bit more muscle to do to.The little compartment for a name label is a nice feature. I like that the stapler can be used on the desktop or held in the hand. The staples that come with the unit seem sturdy and are relatively easy to remove if necessary.This is really a nice product and seems reliable.

"In this book, Eric Greitens explores topics related to inner toughness, resilience, and solid mental health in general, culled from from letters he wrote to a fellow Navy SEAL who was suffering from PTSD, depression, and alcoholism. Drawing on his own experience as Navy SEAL, humanitarian aide in various parts of the world, amateur boxer, police worker, and head of an organization that supports returning soldiers, Greitens counsels his old friend. He often illustrates his ideas with references to a wide range of philosophers  (some examples: Aristotle, Epictetus, Plutarch, Shakespeare, Hemingway, Emerson, DaVinci, etc. etc.)  At times he juxtaposes allusions to Shakespeare and boxing in adjacent sentences, and he seems equally comfortable writing about all of these very different subjects.The book is quite long, and there is a fair amount of repetition. Some of the advice given may have been more interesting and new to Sheets, the recipient of the letters, than to a general audience. Readers who have read self-help books may find some of the ideas here to be quite familar. However, I most appreciated reading about Greitens's experiences as a Navy SEAL; particularly, the phenomenally difficult training that they endure and especially, the attitudes that help them keep going. His writings about teamwork and leadership really seem to reflect his life experience. There is some good food for thought in this book, and the quotes from the various great thinkers are inspiring. I also very much enjoyed Greitens's earlier book, ""The Warrior's Heart,"" (an adaptation of his book, ""The Heart and the Fist"" for young people) in which he describes is Navy Seal training in great detail and ends with a very strong message of hope, compassion, and true inner strength.Here is a quote that spoke to me:""We are all led better by men and women who have been hard working, resilient failures in early life than by those who, by dint of privilege, luck, or circumstance, rise through life without ever having put their souls into a task that tries them....Fine in your failures resources for your own leadership. Let them be proof that you've pushed yourself. Let them be a constant reminder of...how hard you must fight when you are down. Let them be a reminder of how and where you've earned your wisdom.""A while after finishing this book, I see that there is much to revisit and thank about there. I look forward to thumbing through again and finding little gems of wisdom to ponder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V45HHICFXUI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054432398X#wasThisHelpful","R3V45HHICFXUI7","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is based on the ideas taught by Judith Humphrey's well established coaching, organization, the Humphrey Group,which teaches  women to be taken seriously in order to rise in the male dominated business world. The book's early chapters mostly have to do with communication for good self-promotion. None of this seemed particularly new, and I could see where if someone misinterpreted some of the ideas presented, the effect on those above them might not be as desired.However, the suggestions in later chapters seemed more substantial; for example, the model script for structuring meetings (formal meetings as well as casual encounters in the elevator, etc.)  Subsequent chapters deal with more specific uses for the script, and ways to project one's voice most effectively in a business setting.  It was interesting to read about ways that women unwittingly diminish themselves with vocal mannerisms like speaking in a childlike high pitched voice or monotone,  turning the voice upward at the ends of sentences, speaking too fast with too little articulation of consonants, etc.Part Four, ""Stand Out on Stage,"" has some very good ideas for anyone who needs to speak in public. Humphrey discusses presence onstage as opposed to charisma, and goes into fascinating detail about the ways body language can help or hinder a presentation. The final chapter of that section discusses six rules for dressing for leadership.Each chapter ends with some advice for those who are leaders of women. The end notes cite some intriguing references, and I found it interesting to read about the different ways that men and women approach leadership. All in all, I found the the opening chapters a bit superficial, but there were more powerful ideas - granted, most useful for someone beginning a career - as the book progressed. Recommended to women looking to boost confidence, project competence, and understand a bit more about gender differences.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONLFEQUFRH5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118870255#wasThisHelpful","RONLFEQUFRH5D","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FIrst of all, unlike some other reviewers, I did receive the white rack that is pictured here.  I am very pleased with it. I have an old accordian style metal rack by Household Essentials, and I prefer the Amazon Basics one for several reasons. It is quite a bit taller than the other rack and therefore makes better use of limited space. I like that there is more space between the bars, so clothes are spread out a bit for quicker drying. I am using the rack in places where it is not likely to be bumped by pets or humans, though it is really pretty steady...wobbles a little when pushed on but doesn't threaten to collapse.  I think this is because the top bars hook much more firmly together than those of my other drying racks I have used, because the upper joining bars really hook all the way around the other ones.  The rack folds up easily for storage and is nice and light and easy to carry around.  It has a nice fresh look, and the plastic tips at the bottom of its ""feet"" won't harm the surface it stands on.

"I am very pleased with this product. Though the material is a little seems slightly less sturdy than the original Oreck bags, the bag was easy to attach and remove, and I had no problems using it on very dirty floors in a well travelled area. Like the Oreck product, the bags are treated with some special antimicrobial substance. I can't say whether that makes a difference, but there have been no detectable odors with either. The price is definitely a selling point, and these less expansive bags seem to work as well as Oreck's. Nice that they fit such a wide range of Oreck vacuums.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8KWZQ38H7ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4SP78C#wasThisHelpful","R2V8KWZQ38H7ZU","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent book explores and probes just about every aspect and stage of decision making, taking account the shifting conditions in today's work environment.Some the many topics covered include setting a purpose and desired outcome, gathering and analyzing information, dealing with risk,  what to do when nothing goes right; learning and growing from mistakes; the nature of conflict and authority, getting everyone to contribute, avoiding micromanaging, specific kinds of decisions, and very specific and useful ideas for planning effective meetings (much needed!).What surprised me about this book is that it also covers softer topics like increasing trust and feelings of security among workers, building character and resilience, lots of ideas about trusting one's intuition, staying centered and calm when there is conflict,  getting to know one's ""dark and shiny sides"" and so on.  Many of these themes come up repeatedly throughout  the book, adding a warm and human aspect to this business oriented subject.Other useful features include an empathy map and ""five things skilled decision makers do."" The book ends with three sets of the usual Dummies series's Ten's: ""Ten Tips for Decision-Making in Uncertain Situations,"" ""Ten Ways to Improve Decision Making,""and ""Ten Secrets behind Ethical Decision Making."" A cheatsheet at the Dummies website offers more ideas for communication, faster decision making, and sticking with one's core values.There is so much good, practical material here that it could almost be overwhelming; however, a good, detailed table of contents and index can guide one through. Highly recommended, whether read straight through or used as a reference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J26O6WKGM5GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111883366X#wasThisHelpful","R2J26O6WKGM5GA","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tells the story of the life of Asad Abdullahi.  Jonny Steinberg made a through study of Abdullalahi's life through extensive  interviews and visits to the places where Abdullahi had lived and worked.  Steinberg's car was Abdullahi's preferred setting for most of the interviews; in the car, he could keep an eye on any threatening situations brewing around him.Abdullahi's life has been a heartrending series of traumatic events, from the loss of seemingly everyone who cared about him (starting with his mother's murder when he was about seven or eight years old) to being utterly abandoned and left to fend for himself by other caregivers. Like so many others in similar situations, he spent much of his life on the move, seeking a safe place to support himself with honest work. We learn much about clan divisions and disagreements going back many generations, the interaction of people within the clans and the rivalries and tensions between clans. Other complications include lack of identity papers, (meaning lack of access to education or safe passage across borders) all too frequent robberies and murders, disinterested law enforcement personnel, betrayal by neighbors...also, the difficulties of sustaining a marriage in these conditions, race relations in various parts of Africa, apartheid and more recent tensions in South Africa, and so much more.Throughout, Abdullahi always comes up with a way to support himself and sometimes, others (as many as five at a time) in even worse situations than his.There is so much to ponder here about life, inequality, human nature (both sides), resilience, the things we sometimes take for granted, and what economic insecurity and old customs can do to one's judgment and ability to think rationally. The writing gets a little dry here and there, but the messages are so poignant and so important that it doesn't matter. The last series of chapters, ""Capetown,"" was so moving and riveting that I couldn't put the book down.  Steinberg ends with a chapter suggesting further reading materials.Most highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FU3IFHGYNMUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352727#wasThisHelpful","R2FU3IFHGYNMUI","A2CJLDPPANU020","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CJLDPPANU020?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hard to find the actual pages you are filling out. Turns out instead of a link to look at ""my forms"" you have to go to ""reports"" to view the forms. Some things have a form limit set by the IRS - like how many pages of items you can donate to a charity, so the choice becomes tricky but not insurmountable. Do you categorize all the ski equipment you don't use as ""ski stuff"" or put in a separate donation sheet for each pair of professional racing skis? Turbo Tax does that part better, at least. I actually completed my taxes this year on both TT and H&RB. Got a much lower tax due bill on H&RB.Another problem is that if you are halfway through a section of the interview, and you hit the back button, you don't just go to the previous item in the interview but back to the opening page of the interview. If you are trying out the options, say, of making a certain size deposit to your IRA and want to see how it changes the tax you owe, you have to leaf through several time-wasting pages to change the amount. It would be so much simpler if ""back"" simply meant back one item, not back to the beginning.Compared to TurboTax, I'd still use this one, but it has a glitch-y feeling to the way it works, and you have to be ready to really hunt for things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKWRU9I9YCMUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG8FWS6#wasThisHelpful","RKWRU9I9YCMUS","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full of smutty innuendo, vulgar language, and depictions of deviant sex practices. We kept hoping there would be some redeeming value, but after 25 minutes we couldn't take any more. Robin Williams plays a dad who has lost any joy in life, is on the verge of being fired from his thankless teaching job at a high school in which he sits, bored out of his mind, in front of a few poetry students, wishing things were different, and he has a son who is a slime bag pervert who calls everyone the British slang term for a cigarette, which Amazon will not let me use here even thought the film is peppered with it. I have no idea what would make a young person become this kind of twisted filth by the time he is in high school, but I felt as if I needed to wash my mind out after just a few minutes. The whole thing seemed intended to convince a viewer that this vile behavior was normal. I don't know how it ended, but by the time we turned it off, the only redeeming thing the ""World's Greatest Dad"" could have done would have been to bury the world's nastiest son in a landfill.

"It looks sleek and modern. The opener works when you push against the top of the handle; there is no thumb lever to press. On the inside a matching softly burnished nickel finish knob completes the set. It turns as usual. Opening this lock from the outside with hands full means just leaning against the handle or using a free elbow to enter.The deadbolt mechanism comes with a pick shield, meaning, it foils all attempts to pick into the lock with a steel sheath. Basically once this lock is in place, anyone wanting in will have to break a window because they're not going to bypass this thing.Tools needed for installation into a large solid wood door (remove existing lockset first)two screwdrivers, Phillips and flat heada drill with paddle bit (Forstner) to fit deadboltTwo wood chisels with hammerPlenty of lightInstallation was straightforward except for one thing. The deadbolt mechanism needs an extra half inch on the top side of the hole for the toothed cam to rotate. It took some fine chiseling to get it to work.Installation would actually have been much easier on a NEW DOOR. This will work on a metal door as well as wood. It will also work on a hollow core door.Cons: Not easy to install. If you've never done a doorknob set before, I suggest going to a more traditional lockset.While the outside handle is easy for a person with physical limitations to depress, the inner knob is the traditional type and not a lever, so it is no easier to use than any doorknob.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0V55EXLAN1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRR7X8#wasThisHelpful","R2B0V55EXLAN1W","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wonderful all around saw. This one will replace a 12"" Hitachi compound miter (non-sliding) saw that has been put through its paces. After just a week of use, I can say this easily draws a precise cut through a 2x10 at any number of angles. The draw is clean, the fences are high, and the LED light truly accurate. I have read other reviews which criticize this product for having bearings on one side only. Whether that is a previous model or this has had some tweaking in the design, I can't tell you because we never owned the previous model. However, this saw had absolutely no problem with bearings. I will say the kerf on the enclosed blade is a bit wide but it has good bite and cuts clean without burning. I'll put a better blade in for real furniture work. This one is a keeper. Light enough to be portable, too. Fits on a stand with good balance. The dust collector is a bit of nonsense, but our shop has a vac system so that's no problem. It hooks up with a standard pvc size pipe.

"Kills most -post emergent broadleaf weeds. Seems to control pre-emergent weed seeds for about 2 weeks. Do not use within two feet of any living plant.

They are so sturdy and well made, I promised him we'd buy him a pair that do fit. Please understand with the ratings that popped up here to review the product, when I clicked how long they can be worn comfortably it reflects on the fact that they are two sizes too small, not that they are not comfortable.

"It's nice, small, but has some drawbacks.Pros: Very soft whisper-hum on low, up to a more audible buzzing on high.  Adjustable speed wheel allows for any amount of airflow  Smaller than an average toaster, and fairly invisible because of solid black case.  Well balanced, hard to tip.  The three stage filter looks like it will stop a great deal of pollen and other air pollutants.Cons: Although the sound is soft, the motor makes a surging whirr sound no matter how high or low it is turned. Don't know whether this is a sign of an out of balance motor that will soon burn itself up, or the sound of power pulsing through the wires. Either way, that doesn't give me hope for its longevity. Will edit this post in a few months or whenever it croaks and let you know.  It moves a very small amount of air, which must be pulled in from the half inch gap the legs make between the machine and the surface on which it is placed.  The ""clean"" air comes out the back in a slot the size of an average lipstick tube, and again, not much of it.  The clean air vent is on the same side as the plug, so if you actually want the clean air to aim into the room instead of against the wall, you have to turn it around so the more attractive side is facing the wall. It is a small inconvenience but it just seems more natural to me to have the vent facing the room.Ultimately I cannot tell if it is freshening the air or not. The volume of air moving through it even on high is very small, and for people with allergies, not sure if this is adequate.

"The purple band on the package is the color of the ink. Tested. Two days and still waiting for this to disappear - it says it vanishes with exposure to either air or water. Good thing I tried it in a small place on the seam allowance. I was terrified I'd ruined weeks of work on a quilt. The ink never faded away on the pale fabrics with exposure to air and light, but I am happy to report that it utterly disappeared with washing. I feel bad if you read my negative review and didn't buy it now. I plan to get more of these. I have tried other disappearing marking pens but this one goes away the most clean. Really love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q03HPWDBRKYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00175Z2QE#wasThisHelpful","R1Q03HPWDBRKYZ","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works better than I expected. Holds tight, and doesn't smell too bad. (It does have a smell, however that reminds me of Desenex Foot Powder.)  There is a slight learning curve to using the spray. Mainly, don't use too much in a small area, hold the spray can at least a foot above the fabric to be sprayed and place the next piece on as soon as possible. It remains tacky for several minutes. Also, you can lift off and replace pieces but you have to be very careful not to stretch the diagonal grain because they can stick VERY tightly. I had one piece get crumpled and wrinkled and found the best thing to do is DON'T TRY TO STRAIGHTEN it without completely lifting it up. You can't pull it back straight, you must take the glued piece off and then re-set it.I have paid more than this for other quilting sprays and only got one side glued to the batting, and half the front. This little can has allowed me to applique the entire front, stick the backing to the batting, stick the front to the batting, stick the quilting paper to the front, and it is still at least half full.The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that contrary to the package claims it does indeed create little gummy balls on the needle after time. They clean off easy enough, but they are there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJHFVKGGRJE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007POWZGG#wasThisHelpful","REJHFVKGGRJE9","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is no lightweight, flimsy vac. In fact the shipping weight is 18-1/2 pounds, and it feels every ounce of it, even more when it's running because of the amazing suction that seems to want to glue it to the floor. Selling as I write this for $99 from Amazon, this little machine is easily worth more. I had serious misgivings about trying another bagless cleaner, but this one is fantastic for the job it does.What is great about it:1.The cleaning power. Let's just say it picked up an immense amount of dirt and dog hair in one pass through a bedroom. I mean, a shameful amount! You'd think I hadn't just vacuumed 5 days ago. The bin was full to capacity with debris and an appalling amount of plain old garden-style dirt.2. The beater bar (rotating brush head) is adjustable to five heights AND will turn off on bare floors.3. All controls are handy --well, footy-- push buttons to step on. They are very large and well marked.4. The button to push the cord winder is easy to find and use, and rewinds perfectly every time. I had previously written ""The cord is fairly short."" However, I have found that mine had a bit of a snag inside the cord winder. After looking closely, I pushed aside a twist of cord and now the whole thing comes out. The cord length is fine.5. The suction on bare floors was so good that dust and dog hair actually migrated toward it, even before zooming over it.What could still be better:1. Well, once used unless you clean the dirt bin with soapy water, it still smells like a bagless vac. Ick.2. The thing is heavy. For me personally I would not be able to use this on stairs.3. Along with heavy, there is no propelling assist like I have on another vac. I really like that feature.4. The furniture tool is typical of every recent vac I've seen, and none of them work very well. The tool has a little rotating head inside a paw-shaped plastic case. It attaches to the hose by way of the massive suction of the hose, the wind of which is the only mechanism to rotate the brush head. Soon as you touch the sofa with it, it stops turning. Or, you can lightly waft it over the fabric, which picks up only the biggest and lightest crumbs. A piece of a Cheeto, no problem. A bit of gravel, nope. Dog hair, nope. And before you wonder why I have gravel on my sofa, I don't, I tried it on the dog's bed.Ultimate reaction is 98% positive. Would I pay this much for this vac, absolutely. If this were the only one I had, or if I was ready to replace an old one (I have a $400 top brand machine) I would DEFINITELY BUY THIS. Now, if it should croak in a couple of months, I'll report it here. But after having it just a couple of days, I am totally sold on the Eureka. The weight of this machine makes it not so suitable for an RV or small apartment. It's also pretty large to store, the power-head of the thing being as large as a boot box. The way it functions, and the large step-on buttons are fantastic. If you have a two story house, I'd put one on each floor; that's still cheaper than my fancy machine, and cleans better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TUW0PV9A5LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRB3ZNC#wasThisHelpful","R35TUW0PV9A5LF","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hoped something called ""Dreamwalk"" gel insoles would be: soft, flexible, relieve pressure points, and lastly, fit into a shoe. These things fail on all points. Well, okay, they're soft. They look ghastly - maxipads in your shoes. (that'll keep you from slipping them off at a friend's house!) They fit only one pair of shoes because they have a sticky back to adhere to the inside sole. I tried using them without taking off the sticky shield hoping I could switch them from shoe to shoe but then your foot just pushes them down into the toes. They don't cover the whole sole - only one half LENGTHWISE, yes, chose the half of your foot that needs cushioning, the inner side or outer side of your heel. They only cover about 2/3 of the length of the shoe, basically from half the heel to the ball of the foot. So, after much applying and re-applying I finally got them to a sort of centered place that won't make blisters only to find I'd left my thumb in the shoe and it was jabbing my arch. Wait, no, both thumbs accounted for. Well, it feels like SOMEONE's thumb is stuck in the arch of the shoe, pushing up painfully every time I step down.  Here's the reason I gave them 2 stars. They actually feel pretty good as long as you're sitting down. This pair of shoes always lacked something in the arch area, and yes, they feel good. Until I walk around. Usually I like Scholl's products, but my advice is to pick something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDJNNMUAY824/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2TEHXO#wasThisHelpful","RUDJNNMUAY824","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I prefer this coffee maker over any French Press maker I have ever tried.1. Double layer of stainless steel with air between makes it thermal and stay hot for longer time.2. Extra size holds coffee for four.3. Plunger is same size as the smaller glass type, so the screen filters are interchangeable.4. Shiny stainless looks great as long as you polish it dry, don't just let it drip.5. Using the same recipe for this and two other pots, this still makes the best tasting coffee. Why? I can't guess. You'd think the standard glass press machines would be the ultimate. All I can postulate is that perhaps the thermal qualities of double layer design makes a change in the water temperature immediately, resulting in a rich but not bitter cup of coffee.6. Non-breakable!7. At first I thought the lid's unique shape meant water and coffee could get into the lid itself, however it is designed with a steel tube through which the plunger runs, therefore, it is water tight and thermal as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHYX4P4692JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSRQN0Q#wasThisHelpful","R2YHYX4P4692JY","AR6E0WAEOCUKI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6E0WAEOCUKI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Once again Jessica Simpsons never cease to impress, the style, comfort and quality I have come to rely on make them worth every penny and more. Add these to you black heel collection! My husband doesn't get it but each pair in my collection bring something different to the table. D'Orsay Pump's are amazing.What is a D'Orsay you ask? Any shoe that reveals the arch of your foot can be characterized as d'orsay.Additionally, the Vamp (front, towards the toe) of the shoe is cut close to the toes.This combination is super flattering to the female figure and do a great job of lengthening your legs. They look nice and sophisticated yet sexy (these are not your slutty club shoes). I freaking love these! LOL!The height is just right (although disclaimer, I am a shorty married to a tall man so I tend to go for a higher heel) and I was able to wear these all day in comfort.These are great paired with some skinny jeans or that LBD you have in your closet.

"I am kicking myself because I bought the brand-name organizer for a ton of money when this one is actually BETTER (in my opinion) for like half the price.I have  Britax stroller which doesn't come with the parent organizer, this is the PERFECT addition to the stroller, installation is super easy. It attaches  using four velcro straps sits nice and stable on the stroller.This organizer- Two Cup holders- A larger insulted middle zipper pocket in between the two cup holders. Perfect for snacks, sunglasses, any anything else. Its a fairly large pocket.- Outside pocket with zipper good for sunglasses, money, wallet, phone, etc.- Mesh outside pocket as well. I use this for my keys.What I love:- The material is a nice and can be easily cleaned (similar to tent material)- That its insulated so I can bring along a cold snack or milk and it will stay that way for a while.- I love that the zippers come with the bright yellow pulls so its easy to find.- I love the BIG, secure pockets, I do go running with this thing and I like to know that my stuff is secure without having to check for my stuff every so oftenRoom for improvement?- So far nothing! The attachment straps ARE thinner than my name brand stroller organizer, but it doesn't seem any less sturdy/secure. I will report back if that changes.Overall:I would totally purchase this over the Brand name stroller organizers any day.If you found this review or any of my other reviews helpful, please let me know.

"This are amazing quality, function and price!Not sure why they don's have the measurements listed in the product description but these are 18'x12"" Perfect for car windows (too small for my Toyota Sienna windows). I use one on the passenger window and then one in the rear for when the sun is blaring on my rear facing car seat.What I love:- These will stick in cold and warm weather.- Application is so so simple: Simply position them on the window and run your hand over the shade smooth it out and secure it on the window.- I like that they, so far, have not left any marks on my windows (as those suction cup stick ons tend to do)- I LOVE that the WHOLE THING sticks on, not the corners, not just the top and the bottom, but the entire shade sticks to the window. No more corners bending over or flapping shades. There are very few, if any air bubbles produced during application. It basically becomes part of the window.- I love that the mesh outside has UV protection.- These seem to be well made, quality materials.- This shade does not obstruct your ability to see through the rear.Wish list:- I wish I could roll the window down. But I have yet to find a single shade that will allow for this. So this is not unique to this shade.- I will be looking for these in a larger size for my larger vehicle.Overall:I would recommend these for someone looking for inexpensive, functional, and quality window shades for their car.If you found this review or any of my other reviews helpful, please let me know.

"I was super excited when this set came in time for my cocktail party.  Very classy and compact packaging, love the sleek, black look of the accessories.  This would be a great gift for the wine lover in your life.The foil cutter removes the top in a nice, smooth fashion.The wine stopper is GREAT because we rarely finish a bottle in one sitting so the pump feature works to keep the wine fresh. Works very similar to a champagne pump stopper.The best part is the Aerating Pourer accessory.  Does the work of a decanter instantly. This really works to ""open up"" your wine, bringing out its deeper flavors.

"First of all, iPlay is one of those brands that I love and can count on for useful, quality products. So needless to say I was really disappointed in these pants.- first, the cut is super unrealistic. Maybe some 18 month olds have giant bellies but my baby I guess just has regular belly? The belly section of these pants are so huge in proportion to the rest of the pants.- second, the material is scratchy and not at all stretchy. Your kid will have to be the perfect size to fit these and not get any bigger.- third the style, it's sewn so that the seams are on the outside. And they aren't flat seams, they are the seams that stick out.

"Kingtop is quickly becoming one of those brands I can count on for high quality products. I have quite a few of their items and I am always impressed with the materials used and manufacturing.What I like:- This is PERFECT mini bike pump, installs easily. The pump comes with a mount and the pump attaches to the mount with a strap. But I decided to keep it in my bike pack since I have multiple bikes I like to be able to switch easily. Its small enough to fit in my little fanny pack.- Its made out of aluminum allow, and you can just tell by holding it and using it that it is going to last. This is NOT some cheap pump from China. Its also incredibly light weight. The pumping action itself is super smooth.- I love the air gauge on the pump, makes it really easy to tell when you have enough air without having to count on the ""squeeze test"" or carry an extra gauge with me along with the pump.Room for improvement: I wish that this included extra mount accessories so I could easily have multiple mounts on my different bikes and switch easily. But not a deal breaker.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample but I stated that if I provided a review that it would be fair and honest. These opinions are all my own. I pride myself on providing honest, helpful and insightful reviews.I would definitely recommend this pump!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QUOW1VKH6211/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DQ6Y02#wasThisHelpful","R3QUOW1VKH6211","A215LSRYATXVHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A215LSRYATXVHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this thing! Was PERFECT for my mini mimosa bar I set up at a recent party. Its a classy look without looking cheesy.Size-wise - When I first got it I felt like it was smaller than I had pictured, but it actually ended up being perfect. I only kept a couple bottles (along with 1 bottle of OJ) in at a time and there was plenty of room for more. So it looks small but it holds the perfect amount without taking up too much space on the table.I recommend this for smaller parties for a classy look, your guests will be impressed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9UBWLHHCA6GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001I2L6ES#wasThisHelpful","R9UBWLHHCA6GM","A215LSRYATXVHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A215LSRYATXVHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am between a 36C/D so I purchased this bra in a size M and it fits incredibly comfortable.This Bandeau provides some definition and separation. A couple notes on the cups:1) the cups are not really natural shaped. If you have anything larger than a ""B"" the cups will not cover your breast, but rather work more like larger sized nip covers :) So if you are wearing a tighter top, it might look sort of strange, but for looser garments these will work great.2) If you get any color other than black, you can see the cups through the bra, in this case, its not a big deal because I will be wearing UNDER clothes.3) the pads/cups are easily removable, the bra comes with pockets you can slip the cups in and out with.I like to use this type of bra instead of strapless bra's with an underwire because OMG SO COMFORTABLE. However, This is more of a straight neckline friendly strapless. This won't work if you need some cleavage or for a lower cut top (unless you are using it for the purpose of hiding cleavage on a lower cut top, then its perfect) But  seriously, did I mention this is SO COMFORTABLE?I am so happy with this product! The tube-top-like fit allows it to stay in place with out leaving ""Back Biscuits"" and does not roll up or fall down. Comfortable enough to sleep in.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.

"This is a great face mask, got it for purposes of a costume, but my husband also said he thinks it will be ""useful"" :)This looks good on my husband and feels good for him. This is a high quality product. The material is thin, made out of soft polyester/t-shirt type material. With the material as thin as it is, it can be worn under pretty much anything. But at the same time, it can provide warmth that you need around your neck in high wind environments (Biking, skiing, snowboarding, etc.)The face mask pulls easily under your chin or up over your mouth without any discomfort.The only thing I would say is that the mask does not have sewn edges, so I will report back in time if I see that this becomes an issue with wear.I would recommend this.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.

"I got these for my husband to use for weight lifting (these straps were provided by GymBitz) who trains regularly in our home gym lifting.- The straps are made of quality material and are a nice sturdy comfortable fit.- This set comes with: wrist wraps and lifting straps.For those wondering what the purpose of each of these are:- The Wrist straps are to support and stabilize your wrists during heavy lifting. You can use this not only for lifting, but also other activities such a punching bag and any other work out where these is pressure on the wrist to avoid wrist injury. My husband used this for lifting and on his punching bag.- The Lifting Straps - They are Extra long straps that loop around your wrist and then around the weight bar for better grip when lifting heavy weights. The straps prove more gripping strength than chalk or leather straps. Using lifting straps can help reduces hand and wrist fatigueWhy only 4 stars? One thing I wish this set came with was instructions. They just come in the package with no instructions included, this was my husbands first set of lifting straps so we had to look online to figure out how to use them appropriately.

"""Haley & Michaels"" is the debut EP by new country-duo Haley & Michaels, best known for their debut hit-single ""Just Another Love Song,"" which launched their career and is also the EP opener. ""Just Another Love Song"" is a very catchy, up-tempo ballad. The seamless blending of their voices, as well as the wonderful lyrics, prove that this is anything but ""just"" another love song. The heartbreak is really felt when they sing: ""I don't know how you do what you're doing here, You sang ""Baby I'm Amazed"" in my ear, Now every time it comes on, It's just another, just another love song.""Next we segue into the country-rock ballad ""One More Night To Break."" The track ""500 Miles"" is the only cover on this mini-album, the duo doing a wonderful countrified version of The Proclaimers' 1988 pop-hit. This Scottish band had a world-wide hit at that time with ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" and I must say, I like this cover better than the original version. This is followed by the piano-ballad ""We'll Always Have Mexico"" and they really light it up on ""Light It,"" the EP closer, which has an edgier, rock-ish sound than the other tracks.The five tracks on this EP, which was produced by Kyle Jacobs and Matt McClure, are best described as pop-flavored country-rock. They are a real showcase for the vocals of Shannon Haley and Ryan Michaels, to give them their full names.  Their voices blend very well together, producing harmonies that beautifully emote the heartfelt lyrics of these songs. Strangely, ""The Price I Pay,"" the song that started their career, is missing on this mini-album. Sure hope they're working on a debut-album, as this EP is a great taster for what the future has in store for us from this very talented duo!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCZFOXS6X00Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OE1VHA8#wasThisHelpful","R3TCZFOXS6X00Q","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Suzi Quatro: The Girl From Detroit City"" is an outstanding four-disc anthology that celebrates queen of the glam-rock Suzi Qatro's 50-year career in the music business. This British-based American singer-songwriter, bass guitar player and actor is, in a strange contradiction, known in Europe as Suzi Quatro, who also played a role in the sitcom ""Happy Days,"" but in her own America better known as ""Leather Tuscadero"" (the role she played in ""Happy Days"") who also had hit records as Suzi Quatro. This deluxe box-set consists of 82 tracks divided over four CDs, presented in the format of a hardcover book, with the disks housed on the reverse-side of the front and back cover pages. The 56 page, lavishly illustrated booklet itself, is divided into two parts: an 18 page overview of Suzi's career, which made me learn lots of things I didn't know about her, and the rest taken up by a fun facts-summary of each track (including a reminiscing note on each song by Suzi herself).Being a collection of songs that span a career of about fifty years, it's inevitable that the level of quality varies wildly, although this is of course very dependable on the musical taste of the individual listener. You have the highs of her greatest hits like ""Can The Can,"" ""The Wild One,"" ""Your Mama Won't Like Me"" etc. to the lows like ""I Got The Sun In The Morning"" late in her career, to give just a few examples. Of course, you also have curiosa tracks like ""What A Way To Die"" and ""Light Of Love"" from way in the beginning, when a 14-year old Suzi was part of The Pleasure Seekers, her very first band. As songs they're not very good, but they were unknown to me and just for making this glimpse at her early career possible, a great addition to this collection.Surprisingly, the one track that's missing on this amazing anthology is ""Suzi Q,"" Suzi Quatro's version of ""Susie Q,"" the oft-covered Dale Hawkings-song, its most famous cover version being done by Creedence Clearwater Revival on their 1968 debut album, and also one of their first big hits. But this is more than compensated for by the treasure trove of other ultra-rare tracks: unreleased recordings, alternative versions and demos are scattered over the four discs. Of particular note are the cover version she did of the Eagles' ""Desperado"" (with Jeff Beck) and a rock-version of ABBA's ""Does Your Mama Know,"" or the alternate piano-version of her hit ""If You Can't Give Me Love,"" to give just a few examples. Not to mention the brand new tracks exclusive to this compilation, like ""Cost Of Living"" and the Chapman-penned ""Girl From Detroit City.""So to sum it up: this is an outstanding overview of the girl from Detroit City's career (Suzi was born in Detroit), the most successful female artist of the glam rock period. Incidentally, the woman in the leather jumpsuit (Suzi's trade-marked outfit) and the big bass guitar (it looked so big as Quatro's only about five feet tall), was also the role model for a generation of other female musicians empowered by punk, like Joan Jett from The Runnaways and Chrissie Hynde for example. Are there any things to nitpick about? Well, the way the CDs are housed in this set: they easily slip loose from their holdings, and it's nearly impossible to `click' them back into position. So, only based on the songs themselves, I would give this box-set four stars. But all tracks are completely remastered, the 54-page booklet is excellent, and as this is not a greatest hits collection but an overview of her career, the range and depth of this anthology makes this one a must-have for any fan of Suzi, hence the full five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6EX9NTMHV0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW67K7G#wasThisHelpful","R1T6EX9NTMHV0B","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Graveyard Book: Volume 2 is the second volume in a two-part graphic novel adaptation of Neil Gaimans 2008 childrens novel The Graveyard Book. Artist P. Craig Russell, who is a long-time collaborator with Gaiman and took care of the graphic adaptation, figures prominently on the cover, but be warned that each chapter is drawn by a different artist: David Lafuente (chapter 6), Scott Hampton (chapter 7), and P. Craig Russel, Kevin Nowlan and Galen Showman (chapter 8).In the 175 pages of the second volume, which covers Chapter Six through Eight of the original novel, we continue the story of Bod (short for Nobody, or Nobody Owens to give him his full adopted name) as he goes through his teenage-years. When Bods guardian Silas has revealed to him what happened to his family, Bod surprises him by wanting to go to school, as he wants to learn things so hell be able to survive outside the Graveyard where he grew up. At school, he uses the skills learned from his family and friends to stay under the radar - that is, until he decides to step in when bullies start to pick on another child. This does lead to him getting noticed  which leads to all kinds of trials and tribulations (familiar to those whove read the prose novel and which I wont spoil for those who havent), including the final showdown with a man named Jack, the murderer of his family.Story-wise, it stays very faithful to the original prose novel, with words and art meshing very well together. It really shows that Gaiman is equally adept at working in prose as well as the very different comic book-format. Overall, the art gives a very cohesive interpretation, and when you move onto a new chapter and a new artist, the style never changes so much it will jar you out of the story. Of course, because each artist has his or her own signature style, this may lead to personal preferences. But in the case of this concluding volume, theres not one artist I would rate below a solid 5 stars for their work, even though I still wish the incomparable P. Craig Russell had done the complete graphic novel himself, but alas Anyway, a beautiful graphic adaptation of an already wonderful childrens novel, that really makes the story come alive.

"This is the fifth and last comic-issue in ""Jim Butcher's Dresden Files: War Cry,"" a 5-part mini-series published by Dynamite Comics. It's written by Jim Butcher & Mark Powers, with pencils by Carlos Gomez, and takes place some four months after ""Dead Beat,"" the 7th novel in the Dresden Files series.In the final instalment of ""War Cry,"" Harry and his team (aided by Thomas Raith) go all-out in a last ditch attempt to prevent Baron Bravosa and his army of Red Court vampires from getting their hands on the Shoggoth, a supernatural horror straight out of Lovecraft. So, what is Harrys solution when he has completely used up his bag of tricks and their shelter is about to be run over by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires? Well, theres this old idiom be careful what you wish for, as Bravosa is about to find outThis series sure ends with a bang. But story-wise, this 43-page comic (with 33 pages of story) was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but while reading this story, I kept comparing it to those old Scooby Doo cartoons in which our heroes are always being chased by the Big Scary Monster - but never caught. And Harrys final solution to get rid of the Shoggoth, while inventive, left me with a feeling of: huh? Is that all it took? So, if possible, I would have given this one 3.5 stars. Anyway, as with all the previous issues in this series, the art by Carlos Gomez is very crisp and clean; he is especially good at depicting action. All in all, this mini-series was a very entertaining read and I sure hope this team will get together again for more comic adventures in the Dresden universe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZCXVM4AXO1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP3JU78#wasThisHelpful","R3CZCXVM4AXO1E","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its too much of a superhero-slugfest comic book instead of a graphic Dresden Files story. Call it a bit of flash over substance.

It's written by Jim Butcher & Mark Powers, with pencils by Carlos Gomez, and takes place some four months after ""Dead Beat,"" the 7th novel in the Dresden Files series.The fourth instalment of ""War Cry"" picks up where we ended the previous, slightly disappointing third issue: with the unexpected but very welcome arrival of Thomas Raith, vampire of the White Court and also Harry's half-brother.

Maybe it would have been better to combine issues 3 and 4 into one issue, so it wouldn't have felt so stretched out.

"""Trxye"" is the 5-song new EP by Troye Sivan, the Australian (but South African born) singer-songwriter. It's already the third EP by this talented teenager; still only 19-years old but also an actor and very active YouTuber. This mini-album is best described as indie/electropop with a dark vibe.""Happy Little Pill"" opens the mini-album, and shows why this track has been released as a single, as this jaunty synth-pop song has a very infectious chorus. Although well-suited for the dance-floor, it's dark lyrics are about ""...empty hearts, Buying happy from shopping carts."" Next track ""Touch"" has a bit of an EDM sound and took a couple of listening's before it started to grow on me. ""Fun"" is another highlight on this EP. In direct contrast to the song's title and Sivan's carefree vocals, this track is actually about the violent nature of war, with sardonically lyrics like: ""Just don't look them in the eyes, boy, You just gotta' take their lives, boy."" Next track ""Gasoline"" has a bit of an R&B-vibe to it. ""The Fault In Our Stars (MMXIV)"" first became known as a demo recording about a year ago. Now newly recorded, this piano ballad-ish track shows how his vocals have grown since then.While the tracks are radio friendly pop music, their brooding lyrics are very emotive. If this EP is any indication of his musical talent, I can't wait for him to deliver a complete studio album. Hopefully, for that one he will broaden his musical scope to include some rock- and/or blues-flavored songs, as well as some up-beat tunes to lighten the mood. Anyway, I'll be keeping an eye out for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJ82210PUIX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPQDX1G#wasThisHelpful","ROJ82210PUIX6","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Outstanding e-book collection of hard-boiled detective fiction from one of the forgotten masters of the genre, Frederick Nebel.In ""Tough as Nails: The Complete Cases of Donahue from the pages of Black Mask"", the fifteen P.I. stories featuring Donahue, a two-fisted operative of the New York branch of the Interstate Detective Agency, as originally published in the famous pulp Black Mask Magazine between 1930 and 1935, are collected in one handy e-book volume.""Tough Dick"" Donahue is a disgraced ex-New York City police detective working for the Interstate Detective Agency as a private investigator, called ""Donny"" by friends and more worse names by his enemies, Written in a laconic style, the streetwise, semi-scrupulous Irishman was a fan-favorite of the Black Mask readers from the start. Now you have a chance to find out why with this collection!The stories are: ""Rough Justice"" (November, 1930), ""The Red-Hots"" (December, 1930), ""Gun Thunder"" (January, 1931), ""Get A Load of This"" (February, 1931), ""Spare the Rod"" (August, 1931), ""Pearls Are Tears"" (September, 1931), ""Death's Not Enough"" (October, 1931), ""Shake-Up"" (August, 1932), ""He Could Take It"" (September, 1932), ""The Red Web"" (October, 1932), ""Red Pavement"" (December, 1932), ""Save Your Tears"" (June, 1933), ""Song and Dance"" (July, 1933), ""Champions Also Die"" (August, 1933), and ""Ghost of a Chance"" (March, 1935).All feature loads of two-fisted action, flaming guns and whistling bullets, dangerous dames, prohibition-era gangsters and assorted characters, crooked or otherwise; dominated by the tall, lean Donahue, often tangling with Kelly McPard, the sharp-witted plain-clothes sergeant, as he tries to solve a case. Well, I'll reveal no more about these tales: have fun reading them!Frederick Lewis Nebel's (1903-1967) hard-boiled P.I. stories were a big influence to other writers of the era. Sadly, Frederick Nebel is almost completely forgotten today, especially compared to writers Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, who started out in the pages of Black Mask before becoming famous and moving on to writing novels.Nebel's Donahue stories excelled in characterization and action and the vivid word-pictures he painted of the varied characters which peopled his stories. Donahue replaced Hammett's Black Mask private eye, The Continental Op, when Hammett had stopped writing about this fan-favorite, although Donahue is more similar to Hammett's other creation, Sam Spade (best known for his role in the famous The Maltese Falcon novel, which first appeared as a serial in the Black Mask Magazine).Sadly, there are only fifteen Doahue stories. But if you're looking for more of the same hard-boiled fun: Frederick Nebel created another private eye called Jack Cardigan for Dime Detective Magazine. The 44 stories featuring Cardigan, are published in four volumes: ""The Complete Casebook of Cardigan, volume one: 1931-1932"", ""The Complete Casebook of Cardigan, volume two: 1933"", ""The Complete Casebook of Cardigan, volume three: 1934-1935"" and ""The Complete Casebook of Cardigan, volume four: 1937"" and also available in e-book or paperback from Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBB88KE1T753M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFE67LC#wasThisHelpful","RBB88KE1T753M","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deeper is the 5-track debut-EP by Ella Eyre (real name Ella McMahon), the 20 year old British singer-songwriter with the gritty soulful voice, best known for providing the vocals on Rudimentals club banger Waiting All Night (an UK number one single) and Naughty Boys track Think About It, which next to Ella, also featured Wiz Khalifa. This mini-album is more soul, hip hop and RnB-oriented.Deeper is a soulful track with elements of old skool jazz and upbeat modern RnB mixed into it that has a very catchy ""dig a little deeper"" chorus hook. The upbeat Love Me Like You has a more electronic production-vibe and is driven by crashing drums and synths - although the horn-section is a great touch. This is followed by a great cover of Gnarls Barkleys Going On, which is a bit Emilie Sand-ish. Next track Deeper (Friend Within Remix) is an extended (7:18 minutes) remix-version of Deeper that takes it out on the dance-floor with its house overtones. Another, very different version of the same song is Deeper (Oflynn Remix). Its a much shorter remix and puts the focus more on Eyres fabulous vocals.The tiny singer with the big voice and the lion-like mane of hair shows a diverse vocal range on these tracks, but does not yet give an inkling of her true range. Check out her awesome cover of Jermaine Stewarts We Dont Have To Take Our Clothes Off on YouTube to see what I mean. The only reason I awarded this mini-album four instead of five stars, is because the two extra versions of Deeper dont add anything significant to this EP, and should have been replaced by two other, original tracks. Anyway, her debut full-length studio-album is supposed to follow later this year, and Ill be keeping an eye out for that one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQ24P76K75U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOX89FW#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQ24P76K75U0","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was in 1973 that Mike Oldfields largely instrumental Tubular Bells launched Virgin Records, the revolutionary British record label that also kick-started the career of founder Richard Branson, now a famous billionaire. More than 40 years later, it is hard to imagine that for the now classic pop album Tubular Bells, there were no takers from the regular record labels. Then Virgin launched it as its inaugural album - and it stayed in the British charts for 279 weeks. By now, some estimated 15 million copies have been sold worldwide. This 3 CD- box Virgin Records: 40 Years Of Disruptions looks back on the four decades since Branson and his colleagues launched their rebel record label, which began as a home for rockers of a proggy persuasion. The hit-story of the company is presented in mostly chronological order, going from Mike Oldfield to electro band Chvrches.40 Years focuses on (especially British) songs that stormed the charts. As a result, theres not much from the 70s, years which are only represented by Oldfields Tubular Bells with its opening theme and God Save The Queen from the Sex Pistols. So no Tangerine Dream, for example. The 80s are epitomized by, among others, million-sellers like T'Pau, The Human League, Phil Collins, Culture Club and Simple Minds, as well as tracks from groundbreaking records by Giorgio Moroder, Inner City, Neneh Cherry and Soul II Soul. For the 90s, the same goes for Massive Attack, Enigma, Daft Punk and Air, showing how Virgin oversaw the birth of new, electronic dance genres.The mega-success of girl group Spice Girls gets noted too, by including their 1996 debut single Wannabe. It hit number one in more than 30 countries and made a global phenomenon of the Spice Girls, who also paved the way for the commercial breakthrough of teen pop in the late 1990s. On the basis of absolute sales figures it is safe to say that the hits of the 21st century (including those by Emili Sand, David Guetta and The Kooks) are somewhat overrepresented on this collection and also usually somewhat less memorable than the older classics (although of course only time will tell).On the bonus third CD, artists of today cover six hits from mainly the 80s. They are Bastille with a cover of (I Just) Died In Your Arms (Cutting Crew, 1986); KT Tunstall with Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel, 1986); Corinne Bailey Rae with Jealous Guy (Roxy Music, 1983 but this was itself a cover of the John Lennon classic of 1971); The Kooks with Teardrop (Massive Attack, 1998); Ella Eyre with We Dont Have To Take Our Clothes Off (Jermaine Stewart, 1986) and Josh Record with Only You (Yazoo, 1982). Sadly, these covers cant hold a candle to the originals, with the exception of Ella Eyre, who does a magnificent take on We Dont Have To Take Our Clothes Off with her Sia-like vocals.Virgin Records 40th anniversary box set spans two discs, with 19 tracks on disk one, 21 tracks on disk two, plus the above-mentioned six-track bonus disc, making for a total of 46 tracks and nearly three hours of music. Now, one would think that each of the 40 years would be represented by a particular (hit)song of that year. Instead, on the first two CDs youll only find the biggest hits, which creates an imbalance in the selection. Of course, song selections for collections are always highly debatable,  with personal preferences leading to vastly different track-lists. Music that speaks to some, simply doesn't to others. Anyway, theres enough here to get a good impression of how influential Virgin Records has been in the past 40 years while always having a desire to challenge conceptions and be risk-takers - which at the same time, makes for a stunning collection of hits by an amazing range of artists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DX15W1OSA5E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXWY97Q#wasThisHelpful","R3DX15W1OSA5E6","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Graveyard Book: Volume 1"" is the first volume in a two-part graphic novel adaptation of Neil Gaiman's 2008 children's novel ""The Graveyard Book."" Artist P. Craig Russell, who is a long-time collaborator with Gaiman and took care of the graphic adaptation, figures prominently on the cover, but be warned that each chapter is drawn by a different artist: Kevin Nowlan (chapter 1), P. Craig Russell (chapter 2), Tony Harris & Scott Hampton (chapter 3), Gale Showman (chapter 4), Jill Thompson (chapter 5) and Stephen B. Scott (Interlude).In the 192 pages of the first volume, which covers Chapter One through Five plus the Interlude of the original novel, we start with the toddler who will become known as Bod (short for Nobody), whose knack for wandering off (to the despair of his parents) saves his life as the mysterious stranger Jack slaughters his family for reasons as yet unknown. Bod had wandered off to the nearby graveyard, where he's adopted by its ghostly residents and also taken under the wings of the enigmatic Silas, who's neither living nor death and makes Jack lose the trail. In the next chapters, we see how Bod grows up as a child, learns the alphabet, meets up with Scarlett and becomes friends with her (and gets her into trouble), as well as his adventure with the ghouls. We also see how his desire to help witch Elizabeth, who's buried outside the graveyard in unconsecrated ground, get a headstone, leads him again into trouble, and this volume ends right after the Macabray dance with the short Interlude, in which we meet up again with Jack.Story-wise, it stays very faithful to the original prose novel, with words and art meshing very well together. It really shows that Gaiman is equally adept at working in prose as well as the very different comic book-format. Overall, the art gives a very cohesive interpretation, and when you move onto a new chapter and a new artist, the style never changes so much it will jar you out of the story. Of course, because each artist has his or her own signature style, this may lead to personal preferences. In my case, it's the art by Tony Harris & Scott Hampton I liked the least. I would give their chapter 3 stars, while I would award Jill Thompson's art 4 stars. But the rest get a solid 5 stars, with the incomparable P. Craig Russell getting 5+ stars. How I wish he had done the complete graphic novel himself, but alas... Anyway, a beautiful graphic adaptation of an already wonderful children's novel, that really makes the story come alive.

"""My Old Friend: Celebrating George Duke"" is Al Jarreau's homage to George Duke, who passed away at the age of 67 on August 5, 2013. He was one of those musicians who remain outside the scope of the general public and was best known as composer, singer and producer in the jazz and popular mainstream musical genres. He left behind some thirty-odd solo albums, but was also known for his collaborations, particularly with Frank Zappa, but could also be heard on albums from Phil Collins, Michael Jackson and Miles Davis. He is homaged by his long-time friend and colleague Al Jarreau, the jazz and R & B pop singer known for his scat singing and ability to imitate music instruments with his voice (like at the start of track ""My Old Friend"").Way back in 1981, Duke worked with singer Al Jarreau as keyboardist and arranger for ""Breakin' Away,"" one of Jarreau's most commercially successful albums (track ""Roof Garden"" was a major hit in the Netherlands, where I live, and my introduction to Al). On this tribute-album, Al Jarreau re-interprets compositions by Duke with the help of several colleagues, most of whom also had connections to George, so this has therefore become a duet album with sultry R & B, soul and soft jazz tracks. It sounds far from modern, like it was produced in the 80s, which is not surprising given the participation of musicians such as Marcus Miller, Jeffrey Osborne (""Wings Of Love"") and Patrice Rushen (""Forget Me Nots"").However, the slick '80s vibe of songs like ""Bring Me Joy"" and ""My Old Friend"" feels really comfortable. The same applies to the languid bossa nova that we hear in the form of ""Brazilian Love Affair,"" the breezy ""Somebossa (Summer Breezin')"" and the soulful ""No Rhyme, No Reason."" The most notable song is the funky jam ""You Touch My Brain,"" on which Dr. John lends his raw voice. There's also the saccharine ""Sweet Baby,"" a duet with Lalah Hathaway (daughter of Donny), which could easily be mistaken for a thirty year old recording, and the same goes for ""Someday"" with star vocalist Diana Reeves. On the languidly romantic ""Bring Me Joy,"" Duke himself makes an appearance; this track features the original recording of George Duke performing on keyboards, with newly added the haunting tones of Boney James on saxophone (and of course the vocals of Al).So: the final verdict. Well, I like the songs on this record, there's not a dud among them. But that said, even after repeated listening's, only one track really caught my ear as being truly outstanding, and that's the more up-tempo ""Every Reason To Smile,"" with the ballad ""Sweet Baby"" coming a close second. Hence the four stars. But all in all, this new album is a fitting tribute to Al Jarreau's 50-year friendship with this great musician (they first met in 1965 in San Francisco) and a nice starting point for a reappraisal of the work of George Duke.On a side-note: in the CD-booklet, Al mentions that this is ""my first instalment of Thank Yous"" to George,  so I assume more tributes are to follow. Also, in the booklet there's a link to a website from which you can download an extra track: the funky ""Reach For It/RoofGarden"" (although at 128 kbps, it's of surprisingly low quality).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RWQ502ENI53V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQ0IU0C#wasThisHelpful","R2RWQ502ENI53V","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"G.R.L. is the debut-EP by the American-British-Canadian girl group G.R.L., which consists of Simone Battle, Lauren Bennett, Emmalyn Estrada, Natasha Slayton and Paula van Oppen. The 5 tracks are best described as catchy, bright dance-pop.This girl group first came to my attention through their ultra-fun YouTube video for Ugly Heart, also the first track on this mini-album. This anthemic pop track starts with a few ukulele strums, before turning into a very addictive pop-tune thats perfect for blasting from your car-speakers during summer. All five ladies get to show off their vocal capabilities as they sing about how they took revenge on this pretty ex-boyfriend who has an ugly heart. Show Me What You Got, while still fun, is one of those dime-a-dozen bubble-gum pop-songs, with just a tad too much ay-yay-yay in its chorus. The electro-pop of Rewind comes closest to PCD territory (G.R.L. are a reboot of sorts of the Pussycat Dolls, which disbanded in 2010). The girls go wild on the rock-infused dance-track Dont Talk About Love with its frenzied beat, before we move on to the mini-album closer Girls Are Always Right, a piano-laced mid-tempo track that is somewhat reminiscent of the Spice Girls.A welcome addition to the crowded modern girl group pop thats infusing the airways these days. Curiously, the group didnt include their debut single ""Vacation"" (which was also on the soundtrack for the animated movie The Smurfs 2) on this mini-album. A shame, as this is another incredible catchy song. Anyway, although it wont break any sales-records, still a fun bubble-gum pop EP that serves as a great taster for their upcoming studio-album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37H0E7WJPPPVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M39AO84#wasThisHelpful","R37H0E7WJPPPVM","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second comic-issue in ""Jim Butcher's Dresden Files: War Cry,"" a 5-part mini-series published by Dynamite Comics. It's written by Jim Butcher & Mark Powers, with pencils by Carlos Gomez, and takes place some four months after ""Dead Beat,"" the 7th novel in the Dresden Files series.The second instalment of ""War Cry"" picks up where we ended the previous issue: Warden Harry Dresden and his team, which consists of Yoshimo, Carlos Ramirez and ""Wild Bill"" Meyers, are in the town of Montezuma, at the house of a group of Venatori Umbrorum. Their mission: to get them out before all Hell breaks loose. The catch: night has fallen, and they are surrounded by masses of vampires from the Red Court. And the Venatori, led by a woman named Catherine Taylor, don't seem to want to be moved. So why are the vampires bombarding the place with rocks instead of staging a full-on assault, that would be easily able to overwhelm the few defenders? Even weirder, the leader of the vampires, Baron Bravosa, calls for Dresden to come out for a parley. So what's the big secret that's hidden in this place, and that the Red Court wants so badly?Story-wise this 26-page comic suffers from being the second part of a 5-part mini-series. Yes, there's a lot of action, but it doesn't significantly move the story forward. It feels too much like treading water until we get to the good part of the story-arc. Hopefully next issue, as might be implied by Harry's statement that ends the issue. The art by Carlos Gomez is great, even better than in the first issue.

"This is the first comic-issue in ""Jim Butcher's Dresden Files: War Cry,"" a 5-part mini-series published by Dynamite Comics. It's written by Jim Butcher & Mark Powers, with pencils by Carlos Gomez, and takes place some four months after ""Dead Beat,"" the 7th novel in the Dresden Files series.The first issue of ""War Cry"" starts in Palermo, Sicily, where battle is raging between the forces of the Red Court and the White Court. Wounded are diverted to a hospital in the Congo and it's there that, through a trick, the vampires manage to wipe out most of the White Council. Which makes the Council desperate to reinforce their decimated ranks. That's where Harry comes in. Now a Warden, he's leading a squad of green recruits on a mission: to get a group of Venatori Umbrorum out of the town of Montezuma, Iowa before the Red Court attacks. His ""Blue Beetle"" breaks down near Montezuma, and Harry and his team, which consists of Yoshimo, Carlos Ramirez and ""Wild Bill"" Meyers, have to hog the last couple of miles on foot. Arriving just as night falls, they are attacked by Baron Bravosa and his vampires. Will they be able to fight their way through to the house? And if they do, what's the big secret that's hidden there, and that the Red Court wants so badly, they're willing to expend the lives of so many vampires? It's gonna be a long night...Story-wise this 34-page comic shows promise, but being the first issue in a mini-series it suffers from having to set-up the backstory, with little payoff until we get to the cliff-hanger at the end. The art, by Carlos Gomez, is crisp and clean, and he's good at depicting action, although his monster-designs aren't as creepy as they could have been. Besides these few issues which are the reason for the four stars, it's a very entertaining read and I'll be sure to pick up the next issues to see how the story works out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAXWENLSBTL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHXGTGE#wasThisHelpful","R2FAXWENLSBTL4","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Exactly one year after J.J. Cale died (he passed away in July 2013, at the age of 74), this tribute by some of the world's greatest guitarists appears, headed by Eric Clapton. Cale was one of the founders of the so-called Tulsa Sound, a swampy mix of blues, country and rock 'n' roll. The relaxed guitar sounds of J.J. Cale had a great influence on many guitarists, including Eric Clapton, so it's not strange that from his hands a tribute to J.J. Cale comes forth. It's not only that Clapton earlier recorded work from the bluesman, take for example such hits as ""Cocaine"" and ""After Midnight,"" but the two also worked together regularly. Shortly before his death, Cale could be heard on Clapton's 2013 album ""Old Sock"" and in 2006 they won a Grammy for their album ""The Road To Escondido.""On ""The Breeze: An Appreciation Of JJ Cale,"" Clapton enlists the help of string virtuosos like Tom Petty, John Mayer, Mark Knopfler, and Don White. Willie Nelson sings along, as does Cale's wife Christine Lakeland, who provides backing vocals on ""Crying Eyes."" Everyone's singing and guitar style compliments the 16 compositions on this album impressively. Thus Mayer's rhythmic game works wonderfully on ""Don't Wait,"" while his drawling vocals prove very suitable for the slightly country-fried version of ""Magnolia."" Knopfler infuses ""Someday"" with his signature guitar work and Nelson's fragile vocals enrich ""Songbird"" and ""Starbound,"" although his somewhat nasal twang might not be to everyone's liking. Clapton is in great form himself on the funky ""Cajun Moon."" The biggest surprise comes in the form of the wonderful harmonies between Clapton and Petty on songs like ""Rock And Roll Records,"" ""The Old Man And Me"" and ""I Got The Same Old Blues.""That these men are kings of the six-string and give their guitars a good workout, they've made abundantly clear by the end of the record. Incidentally, the record is named after Cale's single ""Call Me The Breeze"" from 1972. But in his four-decade career, Cale recorded 15 albums and was an inspiration to a generation of artists like Clapton, so I only hope Clapton & Friends will do a follow-up to this album, which is a very worthy tribute to J.J. Cale's legacy indeed.Tracks 1, 7 & 16 are from J.J. Cale's 1972 album ""Naturally."" Tracks 2, 6, 8, 11, 12 & 14 are from his 1974 album ""Okie."" Track 4 is from his 1973 album ""Really."" Track 5 is from his 1979 album ""5."" Track 10 is from his 2007 album ""Rewind: The Unreleased Recordings."" Track 15 is from his 1982 album ""Grasshopper."" Track 3 ""Someday,"" track 9 ""Songbird"" and track 13 ""Train To Nowhere"" are previously unreleased Cale songs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RROBW7PKKG1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0X1PYM#wasThisHelpful","R3RROBW7PKKG1F","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Apache Raiders"" is the fourth novel by John Benteen (pseudonym for Ben Haas) in the classic Fargo-series, which ran originally between 1969 and 1977, and is now being reprinted in e-book format by Piccadilly Publishing. The series takes place in the time period between the early 1900s up until 1918, but in no chronical order, and stars Fargo, once a member of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War and another hitch in the cavalry during the Philippine-American War, but now a soldier of fortune.The story takes place around 1915, when Fargo is just returning from running guns to Pancho Villa. Having dealt the Fargo-way with a bunch of Mexican revolutionaries who tried to double-cross him, he's on the run from those that survived the experience. Suddenly, he's drawn by the sounds of a battle far away. Then, when the battle-sounds have dimmed, through his field glasses his unbelieving eyes view the victors - a war party of Chiricahua Apaches. Impossible, as all Apaches have long ago been herded onto reservations. But incredible as it may seem - there they are.When these ghosts out of the past have disappeared, Fargo finds the horribly mutilated bodies of five white men. Incredibly, one of them still lives. In exchange for a mercy bullet, he reveals the hiding place of fifty thousand dollars' worth of gold, put there to avoid the US cavalry patrols that are out patrolling for gunrunners along the border. It's like money in the bank and Fargo's got the only key to the vault - but that vault is in the middle of incredible barren and desolate country, and with just one horse, Fargo has no way to carry the immense weight of fifty thousand in gold.On his way out for more equipment, Fargo runs into a U.S. cavalry patrol, led by a Sergeant Murphy. They take him into the small town of Terlingua to face Captain Tom Fallon - who happens to be someone Fargo served with in the Philippines. Not that that helps him, as Fallon has changed a lot, and not for the better. When he tries to put the squeeze on him, and Fargo refuses to budge, it turns him into a bitter enemy - now really complicating matters. If he wants to dodge back across the border, he'll have to deal with US cavalry patrols out in force and led by a hostile Fallon and Murphy,Not only that, he also has to cross miles and miles of Mexican desert swarming with bandits, including the surviving Mexican revolutionaries who are out for his blood, and find a way to grab the gold from under the nose of this wild band of Apaches led by their charismatic leader. Oh yes, and he's also saddled with Nola Shane, an Eastern schoolteacher who is out in the borderlands looking for a way into Mexico so she can pay a ransom for the return of her brother, who has been captured by revolutionaries. Fargo has his work cut out for him, if he wants to get his hands on that gold.""Apache Raiders"" is an action-packed western/adventure-story and Benteen's prose drives the story along at a breakneck pace. It's filled with the requisite fistfights, knife-fights and gun-battles, and sex with beautiful women for that matter, that at that time (this book was originally written in 1971) were the stock in trade for these paperbacks aimed at a male readership. But although Benjamin Leopold Haas wrote to a certain formula, he excelled at writing action and also played around with this formula, so you're never completely sure how it will all come out.Ben Haas was also very scrupulous in maintaining authenticity. This was something that was exceedingly rare in these pulp stories (even in the `70s these books were considered hack work), but it made his writing stand head and shoulders above the rest and is the main reason he's still read. It's not only the gritty realism and authentic settings depicted in the books, but also the way Fargo is portrayed. He may have his own code of ethics, but he's not a nice guy. So some of his actions are in style with his character - a real mercenary, in it just for the money. Anyway, hold onto your hat once you start reading, `cause you're in for one hell of a ride!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8DLFE2H6IRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMUN8S4#wasThisHelpful","R1B8DLFE2H6IRF","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""No Fools, No Fun is the debut album by alt-country band Puss N Boots, consisting of jazz-pop singer Norah Jones, jazz singer Sasha Dobson and alt-rock singer Catherine Popper. Its a mix of country, pop, folk and rock and consist in the regular edition of twelve tracks: five original and seven covers, of which three were recorded live at The Bell House in Brooklyn, NY on June 27, 2013. The album's title No Fools, No Fun is taken from a Johnny Cash song called ""Bull Rider"", which is also among the covers on this record.The covers are, in order of appearance: Leaving London (Tom Paxton), Bull Rider (Johnny Cash), Twilight (The Band), Down By The River (Neil Young), Tarnished Angel (Roger Miller), Jesus, Etc. (Wilco) and GTO (Jeb Loy Nichols). Norah Jones is also the front-woman of the Little Willies, another part-time country band, but Puss N Boots is much more of a collaborative affair, with each of the trio contributing original tunes and the three ladies harmonizing and trading leads on the tracks, with Sasha Dobson on bass/drums, Catherine Popper on bass/guitar and Jones abandoning the piano for the guitar.Highlights on this album were for me the Jones' original ""Don't Know What It Means"" with its train-track beat and rock & roll vibe, Dobson's languidly ""Sex Degrees Of Separation,"" the folkish Wilco cover Jesus, Etc., and they really rock on the live version of Neil Youngs ""Down By The River. The Amazon deluxe edition adds two bonus tracks: another Cash cover, Cry, Cry, Cry, and a fourth song recorded live at The Bell House, a cover of the 1932 evergreen In A Shanty In Old Shanty Town by Ted Lewis and His Band. Being from outside the USA, I couldnt buy the Amazon MP3 version, so had to resort to the iTunes album, which lacks these two extra tracks. Theres also no Digital Booklet.At first, I considered No Fools, No Fun more like a nice in-betweener while waiting for more serious stuff from Norah, after her awesome 2012 album Little Broken Hearts. But after repeated listenings, these tracks started to gel for me. The ladies began playing together for kicks in N.Y.C. nightclubs in 2008, and now that they have released their debut album as Puss N Boots, its even more clear that here we have a trio of talented friends who are still having lots of fun while making music. Their playing and singing is of a consistently high level, on the studio recordings as well as live, and they succeed admirably in making songs from iconic performers their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WPQGT3KA2NX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIGMNS8#wasThisHelpful","R2WPQGT3KA2NX2","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samsaya is an 4-track EP by singer Samsaya, whose name means doubt in Hindi. Samsaya was born in India and raised in Norway, where she has been releasing albums for over a decade (she released her debut album Shedding Skin in 2004). Her sound is a combination of edgy urban beats fused with Indian Classical vocals, with pop, hip-hop, funk and soul spicing up the musical mix, but for sure her tunes dont sound like the same clichd pop-songs you've been hearing for years.Samsaya first came to my attention when I saw her video-clip Stereotype on YouTube. This self-titled EP serves as a great taster to her musical style. In Bombay Calling, you have a great example of how she uses traditional Indian sounds, mixes them with modern pop, and produces a serious floor-filler. Next is the up-tempo funk of Stereotype, in which she assures us she doesnt fit in any boxes: Ill just dance to whatever I like. The catchy pop-song Jaywalking has a great island-vibe, while the industrial pop of Good With The Bad is another showcase for her ability to combine great hooks with a very catchy chorus.Samsayas floor-fillers may remind you somewhat of Gwen Stefani, with a bit of M.I.A. added into the mix. Most eye-catching about this exotic beauty who is not only a talented singer, but also a dancer and actress, is that at a live performance, she will always have a heart painted over her left eye. In her own words: ""It's a reminder that everything I meet and see, I will look upon with my heart and see it with an open mind.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVN4FQWQHJO64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCTIBFO#wasThisHelpful","RVN4FQWQHJO64","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terms Of My Surrender is the twenty-second studio album by John Hiatt, the singer-songwriter with the soulful, gritty voice, and another highlight in a career that already spans four decades. In a bit of a departure from previous albums that slanted towards gravelly country-folk, the 11 tracks on his new record are mainly acoustic blues, with Hiatt even playing harmonica, something he hasnt done in several years.Among my favorites on this album are the folksy album-opener Long Time Coming, which is a Springsteen-ish track, with Hiatt starting out acoustically. It slowly grows into full instrumentation with a great guitar solo from Doug Lancio in the middle part, before ending acoustically again. Then you have the thumping back porch blues of Face Of God, a 12 bar track where Hiatt asks: How much more suffering, Before you see the face of God, and also makes the harmonica howl. Then you have the cheerful Marlene, a deceptively simple ditty as exemplified by lyrics like Marlene, Marlene, when you call my name, Marlene, Marlene, like a summer rain, but its an incredible catchy and for sure will make  the blues run and hide.Wind Dont Have To Hurry is a banjo-driven track that also has female backing vocals to flesh out the song (although the Na Na Na Na edges close to getting a tad repetitive). The hobo jazz of title track Terms Of My Surrender, which has some of the wittiest lyrics on the album: Sometimes love can be so wrong, Like a fat man in a thong (okay, now to get that image out of my head!) and which is a bit reminisced of Randy Newman. Then you have the gospel-flavored Old People, a snarky song in which the 61-year old singer-songwriter takes a witty look at the older generation whos running out of time: Old People are pushy, They dont have much time, They'll shove you in the coffee shop, Cut in front of you in the buffet line.Thats not to say that the understated but powerful Nobody Knew His Name, the swampy Babys Gonna Kick  again with his own train-whistle harmonica  and the blues-strut of Nothing I Love, the gospel-influenced blues of Here To Stay, a melancholy track in which he sings Leaves are fallin, Winters on my mind and album-closer Come Back Home arent great songs. They are. And like good wine, Hiatts vocals appear to be improving with age. At age 61, he may have lost the top of his vocal register, but his whiskeyed voice suits the bluesy material on this album exceptionally well.Terms Of My Surrender was produced by Doug Lancio, Hiatts longtime guitarist, and weve got him to thank for challenging John to put his electric guitar aside and play acoustic. It was recorded off the floor with his touring band as in a live setting, and it truly sounds like Hiatts sitting in your living room and jamming these songs with his band - or maybe a better analogy would be that youre sitting down for a beer in one of those old-style blues clubs, peering through a veil of cigarette smoke at the stage, where Hiatt and The Combo are having a great time.

"""Calm After The Storm"" by the Dutch ""songbirds"" Ilse DeLange and Waylon, who formed country-duo The Common Linnets to represent the Netherlands at the recent 2014 European Eurovision Song Contest, was one of the most interesting tunes in that Contest. A musical oasis among a desert of mostly pompous, flash-over-substance tunes, it finished in second place. Nearly a week later, the other songs already seem all but forgotten, while ""Calm After The Storm"" belies its name and is storming all the major hit lists in Europe.This country-bluegrass song is simply a consistently high number that is executed to perfection. Deceptively simple, at first it might not seem like much but it definitely grows on you. The voices of Ilse and Waylon blend well together and their warm harmonies evoke a restrained emotional power, entwined as they are with a subtle but elegant melody that is layered over an understated guitar riff, resulting in a ballad of unsurpassed eloquence.The best part? Their self-titled album The Common Linnets is also out now, and ""Calm After The Storm"" isn't even the best track on that record!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EIM5E5B8Q4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5YMP5U#wasThisHelpful","R34EIM5E5B8Q4N","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Rachele Lynae is the self-titled debut-album by talented newcomer Rachele Lynae. Alaska native Rachele co-wrote all 12 tracks on this country pop/rock album, which was produced by Australian country music artist Jamie ONeal. Rachele lists her musical influences as LeAnn Rimes, Reba McEntire and Shania Twain, while her jaw-dropping powerhouse-vocals are very reminiscent of Carrie Underwood.The mid-tempo country-pop song Touch The Stars immediately grabs your attention, as this is a very catchy tune that makes you want to hop in your car with your girlfriend and head for the beach to: Build a bonfire in the sand, Watch the sparks like fireflies. Next up is one of my favorites on this album: Words In Red. This is a real showcase for her powerhouse-vocals and the reason I made the comparison with Carrie Underwood. This is followed by the tinged-with-regret track Cigarette, in which she compares a relationship with a cigarette: Quick to light and slow to burn, Sos the pain that brings the hurt, and Wish I could quit you.Next we segue into the power ballad Sometimes You Fly, another of my favorites. The high-energy rocker Party Til The Cows Come Home is a great party-track, sure to have you kicking it up on the dance floor til the cows come home. In the swampy Fishin' For Something, shes letting a would-be suitor know in no uncertain terms that hes got a snowballs chance in hell of getting lucky. The evocative ballad Clean is a nice quit moment to catch your breath, while lyrics like Just a little soap and water in the kitchen sink, Mama's arms when I scrape my knee, Dancing by the fire while daddy sings, will have you longing for those golden times-gone-by of your childhood.Then we move into power-pop territory again, as the Get out on the floor! chorus of the up-tempo party-track Out On The Floor will have you out on the dance-floor again in no time flat. The up-beat Sticky Summer Lovin  is a radio-ready summer tune for the beach, with its catchy melody and lines like: Aint nothing better than some sticky summer lovin, Aint no telling how far well go. This is followed by the beautiful piano-laced ballad Done Is Done, a track very reminiscent of Shania Twain and one that really tugs at your heartstrings, another example that she is equally adept at singing emotive ballads as well as foot stompers.The quirky power-rocker Two For One Special is a formidable duet between Rachele and Jamie ONeal, a very sassy track that is reminiscent of something the Pistol Annies or the Dixie Chicks would record, about how two women are planning diabolical revenge on a two-timer: Tied up to the bed, Cheater tattooed to his forehead, he will find that Paybacks a bi ouch! The record ends with the melancholy ballad Old Fashioned Love, in which she wishfully asks: Is there anyone out there, Who would throw a pebble at my window, To steal one kiss, Cause he just can't resist. A beautiful way to close the album.This is one of the better debut-albums out there. Not a single dud among the 12 tracks, which is a rarity these days. It has a lot of high energy belters, but the ballads bring the album nicely back into balance. And her slightly husky, bluesy powerhouse-vocals are out of this world. Given the quality of this first record, I can't wait to find out how she'll develop as a singer-songwriter in the future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2926VMM0V4WEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JL6945G#wasThisHelpful","R2926VMM0V4WEI","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Common Linnets is the first (and possibly only) album by the Dutch songbirds Ilse DeLange and Waylon, who formed country-duo The Common Linnets to represent the Netherlands at the 2014 European Eurovision Song Contest and came in second place. Their self-titled record was born from their love of country and folk, and it shows.Of course, the most interesting tune is their Eurovision song Calm After The Storm, also the album opener. This country/bluegrass track is simply a consistently high number that is executed to perfection. Deceptively simple, at first it might not seem like much but it definitely grows on you. Next song, the up-tempo Hungry Hands, is one of my favorites,  a very catchy and poppy country-rock track. This is followed by Arms Of Salvation, a track with a strong Eagles-vibe. Next up are the more traditional country songs Still Loving After You and Sun Song, while the upbeat pop-song Lovers & Liars is followed by another beautiful country/pop-ballad, Broken But Home.This is followed by the Carpenters-like Before Complete Surrender. Another standout track is Where Do I Go With Me, in which Waylon seemingly channels his idol Waylon Jennings, although the song also shows some Johnny Cash-influences. Incidentally, Waylons real name is Willem Bijkerk and he picked his stage name from this country-icon. Foot-stomper Time Has No Mercy is given a nice bluesy edge by Waylon. The up-beat bluesy pop-song Give Me a Reason is followed by When Love Was King, which has a nice rock-edge. The album closer is ballad Love Goes On, Delange's beautiful tribute to her father, who passed away in 2012.As solo-artists, Ilse DeLange and Waylon are A-list music stars in the Netherlands. In 1998, Ilse established herself as a country-artist with her debut-album World Of Hurt. Since then, she moved more into the modern country pop-rock direction with immense success. Her most recent record is the outstanding 2012 album Eye Of The Hurricane. Waylon is a pop-rock-soul artist who made his debut with the 2009 album Wicked Ways. His most recent album is the 2011 After All, while his third studio-album Heaven After Midnight will be released in September 2014.Most notable about the The Common Linnets are the wonderful harmonies, as Ilse and Waylon complement each other beautifully, like Alison Krauss and Robert Plant did for example on their similar duo album from 2007, Raising Sand. The Common Linnets is a very successful project, a superb back-to-country-basics record, that at times is beautifully understated but often enough uplifting. I do hope they will decided to do more projects as The Common Linnets, because this is for both artists an outstanding addition to their discography and also a nice calling-card for the country genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HHOV51Q9X4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4HDBBE#wasThisHelpful","R17HHOV51Q9X4Y","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Love Without Fear is the second solo album by former Semisonic front man Dan Wilson, these days best known as songwriter for artists like Adele, Taylor Swift, Keith Urban and the Dixie Chicks, to name just a few. Love Without Fear follows on his 2007 album Free Life, and contains eleven finely crafted folk-rock/pop songs. Mostly ballads, they are a real showcase for the songwriting crafts of this singer-songwriter, who is also gifted with a clear, lilting tenor.The album opens with title track Love Without Fear, a beautiful pop-ballad with harmony vocals from Natalie Maines (Dixie Chicks). This is followed by the very catchy A Song Can Be About Anything. The somewhat mournful However Long shows some Bacharach-influences with its muted horn section, and also has a great guitar break thats reminiscent of a Sergio Leone spaghetti-Western. Next up is the piano-driven ballad When It Pleases You, another horn-infused track. The melancholic Disappearing is a beautiful duet with chanteuse Sara Bareilles.This is followed by the country-fried Too Much, before we segue into the jaunty pop tune Your Brighter Days, so cheerful that it will certainly brighten your day, and the up-beat piano-ballad We Belong Together. Next up is Two, another catchy pop-tune, and the folksy, almost acoustic I Can Never Stay Mad At You. The album closer Even The Stars Are Sleeping is a lovely, romantic ballad, a duet with the Australian songster Melissa Missy Higgins and my favorite song on this album.All tracks were written by Dan Wilson, except for Even The Stars Are Sleeping, which was co-written with singer-songwriter Rachael Yamagata. With this album he has delivered a high quality blend of country and Americana with rock and pop. My only note of criticism is that it is too ballad-heavy. It would have benefited from a couple of up-tempo pop-rock tracks. Anyway, Love Without Fear is way too good to stay as much under the radar as his previous album did. I also hope it wont take another seven years before Dan Wilson releases another solo album.

"Indeed, it's ""About Time"" that Ellen Foley got around to releasing a new record, as this is her first studio album-release since 1983's Another Breath. In the 30-year gap, she was busy making a name for herself in film, TV and the theatre while also raising two sons. Now, she makes a welcome return to the music scene with this roots-rock-inspired CD. And for those new to her: yes, its Foleys powerhouse vocals you hear in duet with Meat Loaf on the epic Paradise By The Dashboard Light.After a somewhat lengthy guitar-intro, the distinctive voice of Ellen Foley heads into the opening lyrics of the vintage pop/rock-song If You Cant Be Good, showing off the resonant vibrato that was her trademark way back in the 70s. Next track is my favorite song on this album, the catchy rock n roller Nobody Ever Died From Crying (note the Roy Orbison-homage at the end). This is followed by the bluesy pop rock of All Of My Suffering. The bluesy rocker Guilty, a cover of a 1974 Randy Newman song, is the only track on this album that is not original; great version by the way. The up-tempo, punk/pop-tinged If You Had A Heart with its catchy chorus is another of my favorites.This is followed by the jazzy blues of Madness. Wow, I can see her crooning this one in front of a big band in a smoky night-club. And Im sure that the rhythm of the glam rock-ish Worried Woman will set your feet to unconsciously tapping along. Also one of my favorite tracks. Next up is the Memphis soul-tinged Any Fool Can See. The following track, Ive Been Around The Block And Back, is another cross-over between rock and blues, while I Can See has a distinct Del Shannon-ish rock n roll-vibe. Next, we segue into the stomping rocker Carry On (Partys Over), another highlight on this CD, before we end the album with the folksy ballad Everythings Gonna Be Alright.The lyrics reflects her having been around the block and back, having aged three decades since her previous record, leading to a powerful and personal album. The only note of criticism concerns not the contents and/or the singer, but the packaging: the cardboard CD sleeve provides only the song-titles and the names of the musicians who assisted Ellen Foley. No booklet is provided with the lyrics of the songs, sadly. But that doesnt detract from an otherwise great album.

"On her sixth album ""Food,"" Kelis pleases our music-buds with some tasty tunes served on a R&B platter, the 13 dishes served with some Afro-beat, funk, gospel and Memphis soul flavors, with a sprinkling of jazzy horns and a dollop of electro-pop. Her husky, weathered voice is well-suited with this material. Kelis's four year old son Knight Jones opens the album with the lines: ""Hey guys! Are you hungry? My mom made food!"" Here's what's on the menu:First dish served is ""Breakfast,"" a gospel-ish track filled with bass, horns and whistles. Next on the menu is ""Jerk Ribs."" This funky track has a real `60s/70s soul-vibe, and as she sings ""This is what it looks like"" the horns provide the necessary big band feel. The soulful piano-ballad ""Forever Be"" with a sprinkling of synth, is the straightest pop-song on the album, another track infused with bass, horns and strings. This is followed by the slow jam of the seductive blues ballad ""Floyd"" as she sings: ""I want to be blown away, Blow me away.""Kelis turns up the heat with the sultry, mid-tempo ballad ""Runnin'."" Next song, and probably the funkiest track on this album, is the horn-filled funk anthem ""Hooch,"" one that is perfectly suited to Kelis's husky voice. This is followed by the up-tempo ""Cobbler,"" another funky, dance-floor ready track with a strong James Brown-vibe (great song, although I disliked the high notes near the end). There is also one cover on this album, an acoustic version of Labi Siffre's 1971 song ""Bless The Telephone,"" a duet with Sal Masekela that has a folksy, almost Simon and Garfunkel-ish vibe.She goes for sexy and sultry again with the funky ""Fish Fry"" as she begs ""Give me what I want, Give me what I need,"" pines for ""That tall drink of water I notice in the corner"" and sings: ""I need ice cold water"" (love the bar-room call-and-response ""She needs ice cold water"" part in this track). Next up is the powerful, funky Afro beat of ""Change,"" which starts slow but builds towards an emotional power-house vocal performance, followed by the soulful ""Rumble"" and the gospel-ish, piano-driven ballad ""Biscuits `n' Gravy."" The slow, string-laced ballad ""Dreamer"" closes the album.Kelis reinvents herself time and again. Each new album is different from the preceding one, just like ""Food,"" which is a huge departure from 2010's electronic dance album ""Flesh Tone."" So if you're looking for the same type of electro-pop, it might not be to your musical taste. But that said, this album is a very palatable dish, hence the five ""Michelin"" stars for the ""Food"" that gourmet chef Kelis has served. Gotten hungry? Order ""Food!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16F3TD8ZE3RXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0HNOQW#wasThisHelpful","R16F3TD8ZE3RXB","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Army Of The Underdog is the sophomore mini-album by Jessie Wagner & Envy, a New York-based Pop-Rock N' Soul quintet. It follows on their 2011 album Follow It and is a 7-track EP with an eclectic collection of songs that are a mix of pop, rock and soul, written and produced by her band, Envy.The rock anthem and title-song Army Of The Underdog is the hardest rocking track on this mini-album and a great way to start off. Next is the more pop-oriented Backseat Girl, which might be best suited as a single. This is followed by the bluesy Stuck In My Way and the soulful Shaking My Head, ensued by the blues-rock of the sexy climax-song Oh, which seems a bit out of place among the other tracks and while still adequate, is my least favorite. Next up is rock song Take Me Over, while the album ends with the funky Party Revolution.Jessie, the lead vocalist and also long-time backup vocalist to rock-star Kid Rock, has a good voice that seems to be best suited to tracks like Stuck In My Way en Shaking My Head, also my favorite songs on this CD. But that said, and while there isnt a dud among them, at the same time none of the tunes are really outstanding and/or memorable, so I settled on four stars: I like it, a lot, but I dont love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1356S1XL5J2YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J06VD7O#wasThisHelpful","R1356S1XL5J2YH","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Reflections"" is the new album by now 74-year-old Don ""Gentle Giant"" Williams, the follow-up to his 2012 album ""And So It Goes."" The tracks on this album are not originals but classic tunes from other great songwriters. What is immediately obvious when you start playing this album, is that his smooth bass-baritone, one of the most iconic voices of country music, has lost none of its power to mesmerize the listener with these reflections on a life well-lived.The songs covered on this album are, as performed by the original artists: ""I'll Be Here In The Morning"" (Townes Van Zandt), ""Talk Is Cheap"" (Alan Jackson), ""I Won't Give Up On You"" (Jordyn Shellhart), ""Sing Me Back Home"" (Merle Haggard), ""Working Man's Son"" (??), ""Healing Hands"" (Steve Gillette), ""If I Were Free"" (Jesse Winchester), ""Back To The Simple Things"" (??), ""Stronger Back"" (Doug Gill) and ""The Answer"" (??). Sadly, for the songs marked (??), I couldn't find the names of the original artists.Quality oozes from this album like filling from one of America's best, home-made burgers. The ten songs, carefully produced by Garth Fundis, show that the veteran singer picked ten golden musical nuggets out of the country music catalog, putting together a compilation of beautiful authentic country tracks. Songs like the folksy ""I'll Be Here In The Morning,"" the romantic ""Working Man's Son,"" the tugging-at-your-heartstrings ""Sing Me Back Home"" or the somewhat snappier ""Talk Is Cheap"" are exemplary for this. Ever the sensitive story-teller, with the easy, almost conversational musical style in which he sings, he manages to touch the soul of the listener with every intonation.Don Williams is truly gifted as a singer and the way he interprets these classics lifts this album way above it being ""just a cover cd."" Personal favorites on this album are ""I'll Be Here In The Morning,"" ""I Won't Give Up On You,"" ""Sing Me Back Home"" and ""Healing Hands."" In less than a month, we were blessed by the outstanding, but alas posthumous Johnny Cash album ""Out Among The Stars,"" and now ""Reflections"" by living legend Don Williams. Highly recommended!Unfortunately, the bare-bones cardboard CD sleeve provides only the song-titles and the names of those who wrote the music and/or lyrics.  No booklet is provided with the lyrics of the songs and their histories, or info about the original artists. For those interested, I've put this in the comment-section. For the songs marked with (??), I couldn't find the names of the original artists who sang these songs, even when using The Encyclopedia Of Country Music, Wikipedia and/or googling the internet. So if anyone can provide them so I can edit this into the review, it would be much appreciated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102YFI9NXV3HN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZMRVXA#wasThisHelpful","R102YFI9NXV3HN","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Thanks is a blues- and gospel-infused 5-track EP by the singer-songwriter with the distinctive contralto voice, Shelby Lynne. These original, Americana gospel songs were recorded at her Rancho Mirage home studio and the mini-album was co-produced by Shelby Lynne and Ben Peeler.The catchy rocker Call Me Up is a great opener, followed by the upbeat Forevermore. The most gospel-ish song on the EP is Walkin, with great backing vocals by Maxine Waters and a catchy chorus that goes: My feet dont need, To wander no more, Im walking in the steps of the Lord. This is ensued by the haunting, bluesy ballad This Road Im On, in which she sings about how Faith, keeps me busy trying to find it. The EP finishes with the countrified title track Thanks, another great example of modern country-gospel.As Shelby herself said about this EP: ""As a musician, these songs are a way to express my love and gratitude to the universe and to all of the music appreciating souls out there for the friendship and fellowship that music brings us all in the name of love and sharing.""

"What immediately becomes obvious when you listen to ""Duets,"" the ""new"" album by country icon Linda Ronstadt, is that this record is a gem-studded showcase for how she bridged multiple genres and styles during her 40+ year-career, as well as the wow! factor it generates when you realize how in that period she collaborated with most of the biggest names in music on the planet.With the exception of ""Pretty Bird"", a previously unreleased duet with Laurie Lewis, the other fourteen tracks were originally released between 1974 and 2006. Sadly, due to suffering from Parkinson's disease, which has left her unable to sing, Linda Ronstadt won't be releasing any new material, although she did choose the tracks and organized the sequencing of the ""Duets"" album herself.The ""Duets"" album starts with three tracks from the 2006 ""Adieu False Heart"" collaboration with Cajun singer Ann Savoy, Linda's final studio album: the folk minstrelsy ""Adieu False Heart,"" the mournful ballad ""I Can't Get Over You"" and a stunningly beautiful, spare rendition of the classic ""Walk Away Rene."" Then we move into country territory with the bluegrass ""The New Partner Waltz,"" a duet with Carl Jackson, the folksy ""I Never Will Marry"" with Dolly Parton, the acoustic ""Pretty Bird,"" an a-cappella duet with bluegrass musician Laura Lewis, and the Hank Williams country classic ""I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You),"" a boisterous duet with Emmylou Harris.Then we move to Southern California country-rock with songs like ""Hasten Down The Wind,"" with subtle harmonizing by Don Henley, the doleful ballad ""Prisoner In Disguise,"" a vocal twosome with J.D. Souther, and the funky rocker ""I Think It's Gonna Work Out Fine,"" which couples her with James Taylor. Next we switch to the soulful ""Don't Know Much"" and ""All My Life,"" both duets with Aaron Neville, and the sweeping R&B-laced crooner ""Somewhere Out There,"" which teams her up with James Ingram. The album closes with the jazzy swinger ""Sisters,"" a duet with Bette Midler, and the string-swathed, jazzy double act with Frank Sinatra, ""Moonlight In Vermont.""""Duets"" is a great album. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention there are some omissions from her vast duets-oeuvre that made me wish they had made this a 2-disc set. Especially as it was a sore point for Linda Ronstadt that they could only fit so many tracks on this CD. There's nothing from her Mexican recordings, or from her 1999  duet-album ""Western Wall"" with Emmylou Harris, nor her collaborations with iconic artists like Johnny Cash and Neil Young, to give a few examples. Anyway, I sure hope these other collaborations will be released on a Duets - Volume 2 in the near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIDY1NRKOY2EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIT0CHG#wasThisHelpful","RIDY1NRKOY2EL","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Carter Girl,"" Carlene Carter's first new album in six years, is a tribute album to the legendary country Carter/Cash family, Carlene being the daughter of June Carter Cash and her first husband, honky-tonk singer Carl Smith. This makes June's third husband Johnny Cash her stepfather, while her grandmother was Maybelle Carter, from the renowned Carter Family, who played an instrumental part in the birth of country music. This album covers material from the music of three generations of the Carter family and was produced by Don Was.On this 12 track album, Carlene revisits songs that are Carter Family classics and/or have other family ties. And it's not her doing just a blue-grass album with covers of these century-old classics. While staying true to the originals, she revamps them and makes them her own, bringing music history to life for a modern audience. The songs can be divided thematically into three sections (or generations, if you will):Her grandmother's generation, the Carter Family, is covered in the following songs: the bluesy, stomping ""Little Black Train,"" the hauntingly beautiful ""Give Me The Roses,"" the more traditional ""Gold Watch And Chain"" and ballad ""I'll Be All Smiles Tonight."" There's also the fun ""Blackjack David,"" a duet with country-legend Kris Kristofferson and the feisty ""Blackie's Gunman,"" a duet with Elizabeth Cook, who is a honorary Carter girl and ended up singing on six of the tracks.Her mother's generation is explored in the ensuing songs: the Carter Sisters track ""Poor Old Heartsick Me,"" which was one of her Aunt Helen's ditties, and mother June Carter Cash's murder-suicide ballad ""Tall Lover Man,"" a very catchy foot-tapper, while the organ-tinged pulling-on-your heartstrings ""Troublesome Waters"" is a stepfather Johnny Cash piece done as a duet with Willie Nelson.Her own generation is included on this album by one original and one semi-original track: the evocative ""Me And The Wildwood Rose"" was first recorded in 1990 for Carlene's album ""I Fell In Love,"" but appears here re-recorded in a more sedate acoustic version, and recalls the life of the Carter family at home when Maybelle was still alive. And there's another old Carter Family piece, but with added personal verses: ""Lonesome Valley 2003,"" on which Vince Gill can be heard harmonizing, and in which she sings about the deaths of stepfather Johnny ""The Man In Black"" Cash and mother June Carter Cash.All family connections come together in the boisterous album closer ""I Ain't Gonna Work Tomorrow,"" another Carter Family classic, but amazingly, done with backing-vocals by Anita Carter, Helen Carter, June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash. For this, Carlene used the masters of recordings they made together around '86 and '87, so that's why there are the posthumous voices of John, her mom and Helen and Anita on this track, as is the guitar of the late ""Cowboy"" Jack Clement.With the very personal ""Carter Girl,"" Carlene Carter has proven how powerful a tribute album can be when done right. ""Give me the roses while I live . . . Don't wait till death to speak kind words,"" Carlene sings on ""Give Me The Roses."" As a young child, she was charged to always carry on the legacy of the Carter Family music and keep it alive. Well, I know no kinder words or higher praise than to finish by saying that this Carter girl has done full justice to her family's history.

"""Where It All Began is the debut-album by new country duo Dan + Shay (Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney). All 12 tracks on this album were co-written by Dan and Shay, most of them with songwriting partner Danny Orton, and can be described as country-pop music.Album-opener Show You Off, with Its use of whistling, perfectly sets the overall laid-back tone for this album. The infectious Stop Drop + Roll is made to be blasted from your car-speakers with you singing along. The up-tempo ballad 19 You + Me is perfect to get you in the mood for spring break (or for some summer-frolicking on the beach). What You Do To Me, with its use of piano and a great guitar-solo, is another fun sing-along track.Cant Say No is one of the more straight pop songs on this CD. The musical range on this album is further displayed by the ballad First Time Feeling, a song leaning more towards country with its use of mandolin and piano, and the more pop-rock track Nothin Like You, with its use of electronic drum-loop and guitar. Somewhere Only We Know is a Cole Swindell-ish party tune.The catchy Parking Brake is another of my favorites, as is the beautiful piano ballad I Heard Goodbye, easily Shays best vocal performance on this record. Party Girl is another song leaning more towards straight pop. This is followed by the folk-ish album closer, the catchy, banjo-laced Close Your Eyes.With this album, Dan + Shay have left a fantastic calling card both as songwriters and as vocalists. They have a unique sound and the duos voices seamlessly complement one another. Based on the quality of this debut Im sure that, a few years hence, when Dan + Shay have become mega-selling and award winning country stars, they can look back and say this record is where it all began.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5FX9IJC2VPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDRQ3ZI#wasThisHelpful","R1P5FX9IJC2VPY","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The EP Tippin Point from Canadian rock and country artist Dallas Smith is the follow-up to his previous 2012 studio album Jumped Right In and produced by Joey Moi (Florida Georgia Line, Jake Owen, Nickelback). These 6 tracks are a great blend of country and rock, and should appeal to fans of both genres.This EP starts off with the party anthem Tippin Point, a song perfectly suited for when youre ready for a good time. It has a very catchy chorus and is one of my favorites on this mini-album. Next are the country-rockers Slow Rollin  and This Town Aint A Town. The more ballad-ish rocker Wrong About That, another favorite, is a song about enjoying being wrong when judging other peoples behavior just based on their looks, and is followed by the up-tempo A Girl Like You and another of my personal favorites, Nothin But Summer, an incredibly catchy song that is wholly appropriate for blasting from your speakers when driving to the beach this summer.Tippin Point is a pretty solid EP and a great introduction for folks new to this country-rocker, as well as a place-holder for those who are, like me, eagerly awaiting his next studio album. But that said, its just a notch below his first solo album Jumped Right In in overall quality. So if you haven't yet heard that one, go check it out. That album is truly amazing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZ4EVEACEK8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRIPC14#wasThisHelpful","RTZ4EVEACEK8J","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Truth"" (Deluxe Edition) is the seventh album by R&B power vocalist Ledisi and also a different musical direction for the many times Grammy-nominated singer, as this record is more up-tempo than previous releases. As Ledisi stated in a recent interview: ""I made a decision to not do too many ballads so it reflects the more upbeat side of me. I wanted to make songs that were about my truth. This is the most vulnerable I've ever been.""On this upbeat R&B album, Ledisi showcases her incredible vocal range as she covers a wide range of topics related to love, also displaying a playful sexuality that never turns vulgar. The album opens with the very catchy ""I Blame You"" and the disco-esque ""Rock With You."" Then there is the mid-tempo ""That Good Good"" and the sultry ""Lose Control,"" in which she sings about taking the lead in the bedroom: ""Nice red high heel shoes, Left behind some clues, Follow the roses, Let me reward you.""Next are the mid-tempo song ""Like This"" and the radio-ready tune ""Anything."" Standout-track ""The Truth"" showcases her vulnerability, as this is a ballad about the feelings that the songstress went through after her own breakup, and the lively mid-tempo ""Missy Doubt."" On the mournful ""88 Boxes"" she sings about packing up pictures and old love letters, or in other words: ""My life, it went from years to 88 boxes."" Next is my personal favorite of this album, the ballad ""Can't Help Who You Love.""The Deluxe Edition adds three tracks to this album: the mid-tempo ""Mine,"" the R&B ballad ""I Swear,"" which is my favorite of the extra songs, and the funky ""Quick Fix"" with sultry lyrics like ""Baby, you better fix it, Come on, I'm gonna' quit this, I need a quick fix,"" rounding out the 13 tracks.Final verdict: with ""The Truth"" (Deluxe Edition) the New Orleans-born singer delivers a well-rounded R&B album. But that said, after listening to this CD repeatedly for the past several days to let the songs sink in, the truth is that, while these are all good, catchy songs, there are too few really outstanding and/or memorable tracks on this album. So I settled on four stars: I like it, a lot, but I don't love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TO1EH43BQTHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTSVK38#wasThisHelpful","R2TO1EH43BQTHP","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Soy El Mismo (Im The Same), Prince Royce, the bachata singer from New York, has delivered his third studio album. It follows on his 2012 album Phase II.

The beautiful ballad Invisible, about growing up without a father, is one of my favorite tracks on this album. Another great dance track is the English-language pop song Kiss Kiss. Next is the R&B flavored Latin pop-rock ballad Nada.

"The album ""Shakira"" by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira is her tenth studio record and follows on her previous 2010 multi-lingual album ""Sale El Sol."" Shakira decided to scrap and/or rework some of the tracks she worked on since late 2011, as she wanted to set both musically and lyrically a new direction for this album since she became a mother. The music on the finished product is a mixture of rock, folk, reggae, dance and even some country, to name just a few influences, so this album should appeal to a wide range of musical tastes.She starts off with a bang, as the album opener ""Dare (La La La)"" is a very catchy dance-floor-ready track. This is followed by the ska-flavored song ""Can't Remember To Forget You,"" which has also some elements of reggae and rock, and is a duet with Rihanna. The epic pop-rock ballad ""Empire"" is a bit of a return to her original sound at the start of her career. ""You Don't Care About Me"" is a delicate song with a folksy feel to it, but has also some reggae-influences.""Cut Me Deep"" is a ""duet"" with the Canadian group Magic!, and a mixture of reggae, ska and rock in which she sings about the fact that break-ups suck. Next track ""Spotlight"" is another pop-rock song. It has a great chorus and might have enough potential to be a future single as it's certainly catchy enough. The guitar-driven ""Broken Record"" is a semi-acoustic ballad which has lovely lyrics.""Medicine,"" the incredible catchy pop-country crossover duet with Blake Shelton, is one of my favorites on this album. This is followed by the ballad ""23,"" beautifully sung by Shakira while delicately accompanied on acoustic guitar. Shakira dedicated this song to her husband and son Milan, making this song one of her most personal ones on this record. At the end, you can hear a snippet of her son's voice. Next track, the mid-tempo ""The One Thing,"" is a mixture of dance, pop and rock.""Nunca Me Cuerdo De Olvidarte"" is the Spanish version of ""Can't Remember To Forget You,"" and this track, without Rihanna, is even more catchy than the English version. The ballad ""Loca Por Ti"" (""Crazy For You"") is the only cover on this album, a song originally performed by pop rock group SAU from the Catalonia region in Spain. On a side note: Shakira also made a Catalan version of this track, ""`Boig Per Tu,"" which sounds even better.With ""Shakira,"" her first English-language release since 2009, the Colombian songstress has delivered an appealing album that is a real showcase for her vocal prowess. Just a few minor critical notes: the album is a bit too reggae-flavored (not that I dislike reggae as a genre, far from it) and ballad-heavy. Also, there's a tad too much switching between genres, so the album lacks a bit cohesiveness. These nit-pickings aside, it was certainly worth the four-year wait. Recommended to all lovers of great music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z37OGFKFS807/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2V6JKE#wasThisHelpful","R2Z37OGFKFS807","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Gravitas is the fourteenth studio album by Asia, the legendary British melodic progressive rockers. Produced and written by founding band members John Wetton and Geoff Downes, the record also introduces their new guitarist, Sam Coulson, and is the follow-up to their XXX album from 2012.My favorites on this album are the opening track Valkyrie, a real stand-out with its great harmony vocals, the power ballad The Closer I Get To You, which reminded me a bit of a song by Boston I cant recall the name off, and the rockers Heaven Help Me Now and I Would Die For You. Another stand-out is the ballad Joe DiMaggios Glove, which seemed to show some influences from Supertramp.While this is a good, solid Asia album and a welcome addition to my Asia collection, it seemed to lack a certain, well, gravitas. Ive been listening to this album for the past couple of days to let them really sink in, as I didnt want to write a review in the heat of the moment, but the only songs that really stood out to me after repeated listenings were Valkyrie and Joe DiMaggios Glove.So to sum it up, I still enjoyed this album. All the other songs were good but not great. And last but not least, theres the fact that there are only 9 tracks on the regular CD. This is a bit flimsy, so for the above mentioned reasons I have given this album four stars: I like it, but dont love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENXQXSYKWMRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID71ZY2#wasThisHelpful","R3ENXQXSYKWMRT","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Out Among The Stars"" is a previously unreleased album by country icon Johnny Cash, who died in 2003 at the age of 71. John Carter Cash found his father's lost recordings, that were recorded in the early `80s and originally produced by Billy Sherrill, while combing through the family archives. With none of the twelve songs heard anywhere before (as performed by Johnny Cash), and the sound and production technology brought to modern standards, this album is an absolute must for fans of the legendary ""Man In Black.""The album-opener ""Out Among The Stars"" starts out with the signature Johnny Cash train-track rhythm and his deep baritone singing about crime and retribution, and instantly became my favorite on this album. Other highlights are the ballad ""She Used To Love Me A Lot,"" the bluegrass duet with June Carter Cash ""Don't You Think It's Come Our Time"" and ""I Came To Believe,"" a track with some gospel influences. Other personal favorites are the catchy ""I'm Moving On"" which is a duet with Waylon Jennings, the darkly humorous ""I Drove Her Out Of My Mind"" and the even more fun ""If I Told You Who It Was.""So, some 30 years after these sessions were originally recorded, we get to - posthumously - enjoy a great record and the fact that this was shelved - and forgotten - is surprising as these songs show that Cash was in the prime of his voice and thus the album ""Out Among The Stars"" is a great final legacy of ""The Man In Black.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KISXQUK0729Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5D52VC#wasThisHelpful","R1KISXQUK0729Q","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Loco De Amor"" (meaning: Crazy In Love) is the 7th studio album by Latin pop/rock superstar Juanes from Colombia. It is his first studio album since P.A.R.C.E. (2010) but follows chronically on his Juanes: MTV Unplugged live album from 2012. Loco De Amor is a great blend of Latin rock, dance-pop, tropical, Colombian salsa and cumbia. It was produced by Steve Lilywhite (U2, Rolling Stones) and had as associate producer Emmanuel Meme del Real, who provided the necessary Latin-music counterbalance. The 11 tracks were either written or co-written by Juanes, and the Colombian singer-songwriter sings all songs exclusively in his native language.The album-opener Mil Pedazos is a Latin rocker that hooks you right in with its infectious dance beat. Bouncy Loco De Amor with its catchy chorus is a mix of conga and synthesizers while La Luz is a Latin rocker that melds electronic sounds and funk with Colombian cumbia into a song that is guaranteed to fill the dance floor. In the catchy La Verdad, even some mandolin is added into the mix. The beautiful ballad Una Flor is almost completely acoustic.Delirio is another incredibly catchy pop-song. Mid-tempo rocker Laberinto gives way to the rock & roll of Persiguiendo El Sol. This is followed by the bossa-tinged ""Corazn Invisible,"" that starts out as a ballad but builds into a catchy pop song. Me Enamor De Ti is another power ballad, starting acoustically with some classical instruments added into the mix, but building into a hooky rocker. The album closes with the mid-tempo ""Radio Elvis.""Loco De Amor is an outstanding album, a great blend of styles that combine into a best of both worlds type record. All 11 tracks are great, theres not a weak song in the bunch, and his acoustic-driven pop-rock and passionate vocals should appeal to both long-time fans of Juanes as well as newcomers to his music, even if you dont know Spanish at all. Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IVOVCCVOZCGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5NKPPY#wasThisHelpful","R3IVOVCCVOZCGV","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Crop Circles is the fourth studio album by Canadian country music artist Dean Brody and contains a dozen outstanding modern country tracks. Except for My Last Broken Heart, all songs are written or co-written by Brody. This album is a real showcase for this brilliant singer/songwriters way of painting such vivid pictures with his lyrics, you wont need Youtube to watch the video (o: These songs with their catchy melodies are further enhanced by his wry sense of humor.Opener Four Wheel Drive is a flippant, fast-paced bro-country anthem about a guy that boasts about how his prowess with beautiful women is due to his vehicle: Youre saying Look at that bucket of rust, Then my baby steps out,  Ill tell ya boys, I got four wheel drive. Next song is Bounty, a catchy song about a couple on the run that mixes southern rock with some awesome banjo and guitar work, and features guest-vocals by Lindi Ortega.The third song is the incredibly groovy and reggae-esque Sand In My Soul, that makes you want to head for the beach to be, Working on my tan with a drink in my hand. With its easy going lyrics Its the perfect hit for next summer. This is followed by Crop Circles, which tells the story of how farmer Johnsons got his shotgun runnin naked through a cornfield as he thinks aliens have landed. But is it little green men or just some kids out to Show the girls a little good time spinnin tires in the soft ground, but secretly as Farmer Johnsons got salt shot to pepper your...Another lyrically strong (and very funny!) track is Mountain Man, a fast-paced foot-tapper that pokes fun at the men who are desperate to seem manly in front of their girlfriends as theyre lost in the wilderness: ""Baby, don't panic,, I can bugle an elk, I can rattle a deer, I can grow you a big ol' bushy beard, , Yeah I'm a mountain man. Next song is Another Mans Gold, a nice country ballad that provides a beautiful message through various life examples, as one mans trash is another mans gold.Another cheerful and sway-inducing song is Back To The Front Porch, a beautiful tribute to the small hometown he couldnt wait to escape, but now cant wait to return to. This is followed by the pop/folky love story Marianne with its heartfelt lyrics, when Marianne leaves town to pursue her dreams, while her man chooses to stay at home because he cant bear to leave what he knows. The 9th track on the album is The Little Things About Us,  a ballad with bluegrass-elements.Next is My Last Broken Heart, an upbeat honky-tonk song that laments a broken heart, but not without throwing several digs at the woman that is the cause of this heartbreak. This is followed by the country rock with a strong CCR-vibe of The Old Sand Bar, a laid-back and incredibly catchy song that make you want to head to A little fishin shack down a long grass road.The album closes with Kansas Cried, a beautiful bluegrass/folk-ish song with haunting lyrics which tells a Civil War story about A farm boy and an officer's daughter, In a time when young hearts shouldn't dream, as He thought of her in her white dress, As he bravely marched toward the fight that really tugs at your heartstrings.With Crop Circles, Dean Brody has delivered a fantastic album, with 12 outstanding tracks that arent just songs but finely crafted stories with life and character put to music.

"""Jumped Right In"" is the first solo album by Canadian rock and country artist Dallas Smith, and it is everything a country album should be: filled with strong songs and robust vocals that should appeal to both country and rock fans alike. And if you might think that the name Dallas Smith sounds familiar: he was the lead singer of Canadian rock band Default. Now that the band is taking a break, Dallas put on boots and a cowboy hat and headed to Nashville, and ""Jumped Right In"" is unqualified proof that he made the right choice.This is turn the volume up, pedal to the floor music from first song until last. The 10-track album is produced by none other than Joey Moi (Jake Owen, Florida Georgia Line, Daughtry, Nickelback). Many of Nashville's well known songwriters like Rodney Clawson and Craig Wiseman, to name a few, along with Chad Kroeger and Dallas Smith himself, wrote the songs for this album. The result: a very strong record full of pop-oriented country-rock.The album opens strongly from the first chord with the up-tempo, guitar rocker ""If It Gets You Where You Wanna Go,"" a fast and fun song perfectly suited as a summer-anthem, with the simple message to follow your heart: ""It doesn't matter what it is, If it gets you where you wanna go."" This is followed by ""Somebody Somewhere,"" an upbeat tune even though he sings about a man honest enough to admit it was his own fault that his relationship failed.Thereafter comes ""What Kinda Love"", a cheerful love song, which is ensued by the power ballad ""Jumped Right In"" with its rousing chorus: ""When you're young it's how it goes, Nothing to lose except our clothes, And we didn't know any better back then, We just closed our eyes and we jumped right in."" This is followed by the catchy summertime-tune ""Nothing But Summer.""The next song, ""Shotgun,"" is a riff-packed, witty tune that pokes fun at a girlfriend who asked her boyfriend for some time apart, followed by ""Stone Cold Killers,""  where he asks the girl he's offended: ""Stone cold killers, untrue lovers and fallen angels, Are walking around in heaven tonight, And if God could find the mercy to forgive them, Why can't you give me one more chance to make things right.""Next up is the power ballad ""And Then Some,"" an expressive song about a man willing to do anything for the love of his life. Another powerful ballad is the next-to-last song ""Never Saw Goodbye"", a poignant love-song in which he sings: ""How could I have been so blind? I Never Saw Goodbye"" as he's left behind by his lady-love. The album's closer, ""The Song That's In My Head,"" is another high energy belter, which was co-written by Nickelback`s Chad Kroeger. A great rocker to end this album!Next to Smith's voice, which is terrific, the strength of ""Jumped Right In"" is that all 10 tracks are more than capable of standing on their own as a single. There's not a weak song among these radio-ready, hook-laden tunes. Given the quality of this debut album, I can't wait to find out how Dallas Smith will develop as a singer-songwriter in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A4WI65FXDIQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XRLHG4#wasThisHelpful","R2A4WI65FXDIQP","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It Goes Like This"" is a musically very diverse debut album by country music singer-songwriter Thomas Rhett, the son of songsmith Rhett Akins. Except for ""Take You Home,"" which was written by Ashley Gorley, Thomas and/or his father helped to write all the songs on this album. After having shown his talent as a songwriter by writing for Jason Aldean (""I Ain't Ready To Quit"") and Florida Georgia Line (""Round Here""), Thomas is now ready to showcase his own vocal capabilities. And what a debut this is!This 12-song CD is diverse and varied, as R&B, blues, hip-hop, rock, regular country and ""bro country"" party anthems are mixed into a fantastic southern rock/country album that is made to be blasted from your speakers with you belting along with most of the songs. Half of the album was produced by Jay Joyce while Luke Laird (3 songs) and Michael Knox (also 3 songs) both handled production duties on the others.The album opens with the bluesy rocker ""Whatcha Got In That Cup"", and it is followed by another great rocker with a catchy tune, the fun ""Something To Do With My Hands,"" a song filled with a sly sense of humor that is also evident in other songs on this album. Next we have the catchy power ballad ""Get Me Some Of That,"" ensued by the soulful ""Call Me Up"" and the groovy rock-song ""It Goes Like This"" with its catchy melody and the equally hip ""Make Me Wanna.""Then there is the funky ""Front Porch Junkies (remix)"", a cross-breed between hip-hop and country with Thomas country-rapping his way through the lyrics, followed by the live-in-the-moment anthem ""In A Minute."" One of the slower songs off the album is the ballad ""Take You Home."" Next is the bluesy drinking song ""Sorry For Partying."" Now, if you're planning a party, send this one as a pre-emptive warning note to your neighbors! This is followed by the swampy rocker ""All-American Middle Class White Boy.""The album closer is the acoustic ""Beer With Jesus,"" THE stand-out song on this album, showing his vocal capabilities as a balladeer. It's a thought-provoking song in which he humbly sings about wanting to sit down with Jesus and ""Ask him how'd you turn the other cheek, To save a sorry soul like me, Have you been there from the start, How'd you change a sinner's heart."" The song is made all the more effective because of it's simple arrangement.All in all, 12 great tracks with not a weak song among them. I've added Thomas to my list of artists to watch out for, as he's going to be a major star and I'm looking forward to see how he will develop as an singer-songwriter in the future. He certainly left his calling-card with this album!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PS3RV60DU640/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO7HPXO#wasThisHelpful","R3PS3RV60DU640","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Howling guitars, pounding drums and rocking vocals: hard-rock queen Lita Ford is back on stage with a live recording good enough for a CD release, from a October 4, 2012 concert at The Canyon Club in Agoura Hills (Los Angeles). The title (and first song on the album) comes from her cover of the Elton John classic that also appeared on the limited edition of her last studio album ""Living Like A Runaway"" and very much applies (in a good way!) to ultimate rock-chick Lita.Lita Ford is hard rock royalty, with a career going back to the sexy all-female rock band The Runaways in the `70s and some major solo-hits in the `80s. She has had quite a tumultuous few years, resurfacing from her long hiatus in the Caicos and Turks Islands near the Bahamas and her marriage crashing a few years ago. Luckily, Ford's voice still sounds great after all these years!This live album has a nice set list, showcasing most of the highlights of her now rich oeuvre. In total, there are twelve tracks on this CD, on which she is accompanied by Mitch Perry on guitar, Bobby Rock on drums and Marty O'Brien on bass. These three men have made their mark by working together with numerous other artists, including Tommy Lee, Methods of Mayhem and Disturbed.Five songs are from the great 2012 come-back album ""Living Like A Runaway"": the title track of this live-album and ""Relentless,"" the Bryan Adams-esque mini-autobiography ""Living Like A Runaway"", ""Devil In My Head"" and ""Hate"", while four songs are from the 1988 album ""Lita"": ""Back to the Cave,"" the Lemmy Kilmister co-penned ""Can't Catch Me,"" plus her two mega hits ""Kiss Me Deadly"" and ""Close My Eyes Forever,"" her duet with Ozzy Osbourne, in this case with his part sung by the audience.The title track of her 1983 solo debut album ""Out For Blood"" is also included, as is ""Hungry"" from the 1990 ""Stiletto"" album. ""Dancing On The Edge"" is the title-track from her second solo-album from 1984. Significantly, no songs are played from the (flopped) 2009 album ""Wicked Wonderland.""The live-album closes with her most memorable hit ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" the song that, way back, was my ""introduction"" to Lita and one that has been seared into my memory. She performed this song live on Dutch television at Countdown (then THE major music program on TV in the Netherlands) and when host Wessel asked her what ""Kiss Me Deadly"" was all about, she just grabbed him and kissed him deadly... well, he was still alive afterwards, but you know what I mean (o:I only have one quibble with this album: according to the booklet which contains a set list of the songs she played at The Canyon Club, some were omitted from this live album... A very curious choice. Now why weren't these included? Maybe copyright issues, as other reviewers have noted. Anyway, this CD is very definitely one for the record collection!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26YOXFBEXKBBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERXKXSA#wasThisHelpful","R26YOXFBEXKBBW","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The River & The Thread"", the first release of new material in nearly a decade by singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash is a wonderful ""travelogue"" through the South. After having listened to this album, I thought: Wow! Her late father Johnny Cash would have been so proud of her. Of course, I should mention that you need to listen to this album multiple times to be able to truly appreciate it as this is not a musical ""quickie"", so to speak. Take your time, sit back, close your eyes and really listen so you can immerse yourself in these wonderful songs.This album is not something you can easily put a music-label on as it has elements of country, folk, bluesy soul, jazz and pop/rock. These personal songs are lyrical stories about her travels in the Deep South put to music, using her wonderful voice to paint word-pictures as she examines what it means to be a Southern American. Rosanne Cash wrote the album's 11 original songs with her longtime collaborator and husband John Leventhal, who also served as producer, arranger and guitarist.""A Feather's Not A Bird"", the opening song of the album, and which reminded me of Creedence Clearwater Revival, is a great example of Rosanne's mixing of styles. ""Sunken Lands"", named for the area where Johnny Cash grew up, is a nice harmonic ditty, and ""Etta's Tune"" is an ode to Etta and Marshall Grant, Marshall being a longtime family friend and member of Johnny Cash's band. The catchy ""Modern Blue"" has a strong Tom Petty/Jeff Lynne-vibe and the hymn-like ""Tell Heaven"" is a meditation on longing and loneliness.Next is the moody Southern pop song ""The Long Way Home"", about memories of her father and her time in Tennessee, which is followed by ""World Of Strange Design"" with its catchy country chorus. ""Night School"" evokes the mood of a nursery rhyme while the bluesy ""50,000 Watts"" with its gospel overtones is one of my favorites. Another great song is ""When the Master Calls The Roll"", a tale of love torn apart during the Civil War with elements from gospel and Irish folk (and based on two of Cash's relatives from the Civil War era).Cash finishes with ""Money Road"", an evocative song about a road in Mississippi where you find the grave of blues legend Robert Johnson; the grocery store where in 1955 the black youth Emmett Till supposedly flirted with a white woman and was hanged for that offence; and the Tallahatchie Bridge, which features also in ""Ode To Billie Joe,"" Bobbie Gentry's 1967 hit about two lovers who drop something forever mysterious off that bridge.Rosanne Cash is an outstanding singer-songwriter, making every word and every note count, with a crystalline voice that fits perfectly with her style of music. As I said at the start of this review, take your time as you listen to ""The River & The Thread"", as these songs are threaded together into one cohesive work that should be listened to from front to back in its entirety without interruptions. Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C2DSOK12CPKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZRMHDG#wasThisHelpful","R2C2DSOK12CPKI","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ilse DeLange (correctly spelled in Dutch, Ilse De Lange) is a Dutch country and pop singer/songwriter. Her new, seventh album ""Eye Of The Hurricane"" is in many ways a break with predecessor ""Next To Me"", her 2010 album which was a return to the pure country sound from the beginning of her career. The 12 tracks on this new album are more pop oriented, with country as just one of the many influences, alternating up-tempo songs with more understated, very personal ballads that reflect her feelings of the past year.Three songs on the album are about her father, who died in January, 2012: the country ballad ""Time Will Have To Wait"", ""We Are One"" and ""I Need For You"". These moments of reflection are balanced by the more upbeat songs, making for a very eclectic album. For example, the song ""Dance On The Heartbreak"" is reminiscent of Maroon 5, while ""Magic"" seems to be influenced by Muse and ""Just Kids"" could have been a track written for Nelly Fortado.Ilse has a beautiful voice and has packed this CD with some amazing songs, a lot of them single-material with the potential to become major (international) hits, like the songs ""Space Cowboy"" and ""We Are Diamonds"". Some of my other favorites on this album are the tracks ""Hurricane"" and ""Winter Of Love"" (which have also been hit-singles in the Netherlands).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGF5ISL29SHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WNSKU4#wasThisHelpful","R2NGF5ISL29SHD","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although now all but forgotten, in his days writing for the pulps Frederick Nebel (1903-1967) was as popular and well respected as Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Nebel created private-eye Cardigan for the pulp magazine Dime Detective, which was second only to the famous Black Mask Magazine in the cultivation of the hard-boiled detective genre and Jack Cardigan, the two-fisted op from Cosmos Detective Agency, was one of the main reasons behind its success.Volume 1 of The Complete Casebook of Cardigan features an introduction by Will Murray and 11 stories from the period 1931-1932 with the original illustrations by John Fleming Gould. The stories are: Death Alley (November, 1931), Hell's Pay Check (December, 1931), Six Diamonds and a Dick (January, 1932), And There Was Murder (February, 1932), Phantom Fingers (March, 1932), Murder on the Loose (April, 1932), Rogues' Ransom (August, 1932), Lead Pearls (September, 1932), The Dead Don't Die (October, 1932), The Candy Killer (November, 1932), and A Truck-Load of Diamonds (December, 1932).Cardigan is a private eye stamped from the same mold as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, those icons of hard-boiled fiction created by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler: a laconic, wise-cracking gumshoe with a fondness for booze and dames in trouble, as quick with his fists as his gun, and a tendency to stumble over corpses and have a run-in with the law.As Ive read these volumes a bit in reverse order (volumes 2, 3 and 4 are available in e-book version, while no. 1 is not, so this one is actually the last one I bought and read) its fun to see how Nebel developed Cardigan in the course of the series. Ive described his later stories as small gems of hard-boiled fiction; the first couple of stories in this collection are also diamonds, but still a bit in the rough, as Nebel was obviously still working on finding his Cardigan-voice.It didnt take Nebel long to hit on the Cardigan trade-marks that lasted throughout the series. At first Cardigan is just described as big and shaggy-headed. In the second story, his faded fedora pops up, which gets more battered throughout the series, while in Six Diamonds And A Dick we get introduced to Patricia Seaward, from then on a recurring character in the series.Although the first stories take place in St. Louise, with Cardigan being the head of the Cosmos Agency branch in that city, from Murder On The Loose on, he is in New York, working for agency-head Hammerhorn, having had to move because he antagonized the wrong people and they broke his license in the State of Missouri.No matter where these stories take place, these two-fisted tales are exemplars of how noir fiction should be written, filled to the brim with slam-bang action, keen characterization and crackling dialogue. Recommended for all lovers of hardboiled and pulp fiction!If you haven't read them yet and this collection has whetted your appetite for more of Nebels work: next to the three other volumes in the ""Complete Casebook of Cardigan"" series, there is the one-volume ""Tough as Nails: The Complete Cases of Donahue"", which collects the fifteen hard-boiled P.I. stories about gumshoe Donahue, a character similar to Cardigan, which Nebel wrote for Black Mask Magazine, and of course the four volumes in the The Complete Cases of MacBride & Kennedy series (of which the first two volumes are available at the time when this review was written) and which collect the 39 stories Nebel wrote featuring police Captain Steve MacBride and reporter Kennedy of the Free Press, also for Black Mask Magazine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCV77GW944EH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618270117#wasThisHelpful","RCV77GW944EH0","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this album as a Christmas-present from American friends, who know I love the Asterix series. As a lifelong Asterix fan, I was wondering how the English version would hold up, compared to the Dutch translations I'm used to.The good news is, this one is a step up from the previous two albums. But then again, nothing could be worse than the atrocious ""Asterix And The Falling Sky"" (I mean, come on, Asterix and aliens??). So I was wondering what would happen now that Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad have taken over and if they would be able to breathe life back in to the series.The art by Didier Conrad: while not on a par with Uderzo, it is a reasonably close approximation. At least the characters were perfectly realized and true to Uderzo's original style. Some panels had me thinking: this is probably how Uderzo would have done the layout. But as Uderzo was involved in the production, I don't know whose idea this was. Though there is room for growth, this is a reasonable good first attempt so I give the art four stars.The scenario by Jean-Yves Ferri: the first couple of pages aren't too bad and a nice set-up for the story to follow. But then, it starts heading downhill. The overall story-line was muddled and didn't really get off the ground. The census taker seemed redundant to me (lost comic opportunity here) while lots of opportunities to poke fun at the Scots were passed over while some of the jokes that were made, fell flat. So, overall, I give the scenario two stars.The translation by Anthea Bell: in the Dutch edition of this album, the translation seemed rather bland. My French isn't good enough to read Asterix in the original language, so I was wondering if the English version would be any better. But there are only slight differences between the Dutch and English versions of this album. For example, in the Dutch translation the druid Getavix is called Panoramix and Cacofonix is called Assurancetourix (I must say, I like the English name better). MacAroon is called MacAdam and his enemy MacCabaeus is called MacAber in Dutch.Textually, what's missing in both Dutch and English versions is the sly wit and double (often triple) meanings that Goscinny would layer through the text, so I assume this is a failing not in the translation but in the French source as well. As mentioned above, the humor is very hit and miss (mostly misses), generally lacking the subtlety and warmth I'm used to from the Goscinny/Uderzo-combo. So I would say that, for better or worse, the translation is ""spot on"".Trying hard not to look at this album through Goscinny/Uderzo-tinted glasses, because Ferri & Conrad have some admittedly very big shoes to fill, I would say this is overall an okay first-time effort, hence the three stars. But they really need to step up to the plate in their next effort, especially scenario-wise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37AIK63K5P16T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444011677#wasThisHelpful","R37AIK63K5P16T","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Feels Like Caroline"" by the country rock group Parmalee is an outstanding debut album that features 12 very impressive and diverse tracks, ranging from party anthems to power ballads, well suited to fans of modern country as well as rock and a showcase for their ability to combine catchy melodies with great lyrics.Parmalee is a family band comprised of brothers Matt and Scott Thomas (lead vocals/guitar and drums), cousin Barry Knox (bass), and best friend Josh McSwain (guitar), who all come from the same small town in North Carolina. The bulk of the songs on this album are written and/or co-written by members of the band, who tend to describes themselves as being on ""the country side of rock"", and this is reflected in the songs, that nicely blur the lines between country and rock.They really rock with the fun after-the-party-is-over ""Musta Had a Good Time"" (must have been an epic party, considering lines like: ""Hey y'all, is that my dog up on the roof?, And, good God, why's my car out in the pool?"") and the even more hard-rocky  ""I'll Bring the Music"", but this is bridged by the laid-back, ultra-catchy tune ""Day Drinkin',"" and ballads like the tugging-at-your-heartstrings lovesong ""Caroline"", ""My Montgomery"" and ""Think You Oughta Know That"" nicely balance the album.All 12 tracks are great, there's not a dud among them, but my own favorite songs on this CD are: the groovy ""Day Drinkin' "", ""Caroline"" and ""Another Day Gone"", another song with great lyrics, like the opening lines: ""I screwed up seven summers, In one afternoon gone wrong, It started out like ""Amazing Grace"", Ended like a Springsteen song"". Now that's what I call song-writing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SIUYGIUOZWPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G95GMV6#wasThisHelpful","R1SIUYGIUOZWPU","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I bought this CD, I thought: Wow! Gretchen is gonna rock the house with these songs! I know she can deliver, just check out her fantastic rendition of Heart's ""Barracuda"" on Youtube (now why wasn't that song on this album? It's classic rock from the `70s and she knocks that one right out of the ballpark in terms of matching the amazing vocals of Ann Wilson).But sadly, this 12-track album is for the most part a prime example of how not to do a cover album. Doing covers of classic rock from the `70s can be a tricky business. You either should have an original take on them (I had expected Gretchen to do a country adaptation of these songs, which might also have failed but at least could have been interesting) or you should have the power-vocals to do these classics justice if you want to do faithful-to-the-original renditions.The songs she covers are ""Stay With Me"" (Faces), ""Doctor My Eyes"" (Jackson Browne), ""Everybody Wants You"" (Billy Squier), ""Bell Bottom Blues"" (Derek and the Dominos), ""Funk #49"" (James Gang), ""Hot Blooded"" (Foreigner), ""Over The Hills & Far Away"" (Led Zeppelin), ""I Want You To Want Me"" (Cheap Trick), ""Lights"" (Journey), ""Her Strut"" (Bob Seger), ""Bad Company"" (Bad Company) and ""Into The Mystic"" (Van Morrison).I like Gretchen's vocals and CDs and I have a broad taste in music, so I'm not turned away just because she strays out of the boundaries of country. And she might be a redneck woman with a lot of sass and a great voice, but on most of these songs she suddenly seems to lack the ""rock chick"" power to do them justice. In fact, some of these covers sound like her heart wasn't in them. They are curiously flat with just not enough emotion in their delivery; weird, because these are supposed to be some of her favorite `70s rock songs.The only outstanding covers on this album are ""Hot Blooded"", ""Her Strut"" (those two are her best covers on this CD, showing she can really rock if she wants to) and the acoustic ""Into The Mystic"". While most songs hover somewhere between two and three stars, ""Stay With Me"", ""Lights"" and ""Bad Company"" are the worst renditions, in my opinion. So, adding the points up and dividing them by 12, I come to an average of 2.7 stars, hence the three-star rating. Luckily, her other new CD ""Right On Time"" is great, so go buy that one instead!","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26W2F73TI3Z0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3MKA0S#wasThisHelpful","R26W2F73TI3Z0L","A2HTF88O2QYO7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HTF88O2QYO7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is definitely worth your while if you are starting the violin as an adult, or returning to it after a long break. However I cannot imagine anyone being able to successfully start from scratch as a player using only this book as a guide without running into some major problems. There are so many issues of form and posture with the violin, since it requires so many unnatural and counter-intuitive positions and movements, that you just have to not only see or read about, but have someone there physically able to correct and guide you, to learn it properly. And considering the physical consequences of playing the violin with bad form, it's bordering on irresponsible to suggest to anyone that they learn to play from a book. Once you get started with bad form--just a millimeter off, for some things--it's going to be difficult to later break yourself of that habit, and you could end up with carpal tunnel or worse.So definitely invest in a real time teacher at least to get you set up with the proper posture and form before you take off studying on your own. If you have already had some instruction and feel confident that you are able to play with good form--no chicken wing right arm, no beggar's hunch left wrist, no subluxing pinkies--then this book will make a great refresher for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYVUTRMWR1M8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119022908#wasThisHelpful","R2RYVUTRMWR1M8","A6VSWJVTWEOII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VSWJVTWEOII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cat has kind of a sensitive system and normally eats a grain free dry food. Sometimes I will give her a can of wet food as a treat or to help her appetite when she's under the weather, and normally she slurps it right up. She wasn't too fond of this stuff. She did try it, but she didn't seem to like it very much and didn't finish what I put out. As a cat owner, I would not buy this stuff routinely because it has grains in it, specifically advertising quinoa. Now I know quinoa is very trendy for health-conscious humans, but is it really the best thing to feed to a cat? Cats are carnivores. My cat definitely does best with grain-free food, both in terms of health and enthusiasm for eating.

"This is a decent guide to a limited number of very common plants that have medicinal properties. The recipes are easy to follow and cover a range of needs, from culinary to comfort to cure. Most of the plants are easily found in temperate parts of North America or, in some cases, in your garden or grocery store. The book serves as a good introduction to some traditional uses of plant medicine. The only problem I have with it is I wish she had shared some more specific information about safety. Some of the herbs in this book, such as elderberry, must be prepared very carefully to separate the helpful parts from the harmful parts. And others are not ideal for pregnant women or children to use.

"This is a nicely designed test that is indeed very easy to use. The absorbent tip turns hot pink (not a light pink that might alarm the skittish hopeful conceiver) when it touches your ""stream"" leaving no doubt as to whether you ""got it"" or not. The handle is designed in a kind of ergonomic way that makes it easier to avoid drops, spills, and awkward angles. I could not find information on the box about the precise sensitivity to HCG of this test, but other sources online (trust at your own risk) claim it is sensitive to either 20 or 25 mcg, which is comparable to other early pregnancy tests. I had already confirmed my pregnancy with a Dollar Store test at 12 DPO (1-2 days before expected period) when I tried this test for comparison. I tried the Clearblue Easy test at 15 DPO. I wanted to see how the sensitivity compared to the Dollar Store product so I put it to the test--middle of the day, normal amount of fluid intake. And I got a dark blue, unambiguous positive before I even set the test on the counter. The unambiguous nature of this test makes it very reassuring. With two tests in the box, it's not a bad deal for the current list price of around $7. Other tests offer the same level of accuracy for less cost, but this one definitely has a number of improvements that may make it worth the extra expense for you. For instance, compared to the Dollar Store test, this one was far easier and less annoying to use (the Dollar Store products requires you to capture a sample in a container and use a dropper to apply it to the test). Overall, a good product that gives a clear answer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27V1LYER4FL11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GXEHL8#wasThisHelpful","R27V1LYER4FL11","A6VSWJVTWEOII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VSWJVTWEOII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Coptic monophysites in Egypt, Armenian monasteries, Ethiopia's ancient Orthodox church, the Catholics of St. Thomas in India, Russian Orthodoxy, South American Catholicism, African Anglicans...Nope. None of that. Not even one bit of it. This whole book is about a very narrow band of Christianity that matches up with the nondenominational evangelical Protestantism which the author practices in Alabama.There are over one billion Catholics in the world. The author's first stop, Brazil, is home to more Catholics than any other country in the world. Instead, we get to visit some American missionary's nondenominational church where they perform ""skits,"" and hear about primitive pagan beliefs held by some locals.This is not just absurd and frustrating, it's insulting. The author wants to pretend her Alabama nondenominationalism is representative of Christianity as a whole.

I would have given it more of a chance to win me over but one of the first several entries I looked at used a ""humorous"" invocation of violence to make a hyperbolic point. The author said something about wanting to ""punch people in the throat"" for saying something he found upsetting. Well he may feel that way, but as a Christian and a minister, no less, he should probably think hard about more constructive ways to frame that difference of opinion and moderate the emotional reaction so as to be a better example. Yes I know ""I want to punch them in the throat"" is a very popular turn of phrase among many on the internet, but when you're paying actual American currency to read a book by an ordained minister, it's absolutely acceptable to expect better.Other than that, this really is just another mediocre book of ""spiritual but not religious"" type insights for the liberal Protestant reader, alas.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBH9JOGBHZN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426790171#wasThisHelpful","R3JBH9JOGBHZN5","A6VSWJVTWEOII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VSWJVTWEOII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The reading level is definitely on the easier side, so I think it works well as it is described--a bridge between picture books and chapter books.My 8 year old is already reading more complex books but she still enjoyed this one. The plot reminds me of a My Little Pony or Equestria Girls type scenario, but not as well-written. It's still perfectly fine for her to read, though. And then she read it to her little sisters who also loved it--the adorable illustrations definitely hold their attention. They're nagging me to buy the next installments, of course.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TU4ZO4BJ6OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545683629#wasThisHelpful","R26TU4ZO4BJ6OQ","A6VSWJVTWEOII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VSWJVTWEOII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected to love this and looked forward to previewing it, because I have always enjoyed Lonely Planet books. I remember traveling the world with them--from my armchair--as I took in all the details of off-the-beaten-path stops and tantalizing descriptions of local food. The guides were never dry, always fun, with enough detail to take you there.This book though...I don't know what to make of it. It is a collection of infographics, many of which are cute and mildly amusing. But it doesn't really cohere at all, and each segment is so brief, it's not all that informative. There's just enough to make you think ""hmm"" for a second, and not any depth, resources for further study, or even that much wit. It's neither wide enough nor deep enough to really merit the inclusion of the word ""expert."" And as a hefty hardcover tome, it's more like an odd coffee table book than anything you would think of as ""instant""--especially in the era of the internet on mobile phones.I'm not sure who this book is for. There's not enough information to help you actually fake your way through anything. And it's not witty enough to really count as enthralling entertainment. I guess it's kind of a bathroom book, but it's a bit hefty on the price scale for that humble aspiration. It's really too bad, as there was potential for something really fun here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IKAZ8NL2E1T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743219997#wasThisHelpful","R3IKAZ8NL2E1T1","A6VSWJVTWEOII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VSWJVTWEOII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My eight-year-old actually likes this book a lot, and she wasn't even familiar with the Kaya character before reading it. She has enjoyed the ""choose your own adventure"" format a lot. I subtracted stars from my rating for a purely parental rating--you can't read the whole book in the book. Some of the options lead you to a website. On that website, you are shown and invited to purchase all of the numerous other books in this series and associated products. Essentially it's like they have put a big ad in the middle of the book.

"It's hard to know how long to expect for results to be apparent with a product like this. I personally have not found it to make much a difference so far for my mood and energy, but then again my seasonal issues are idiosyncratic so it may not be the best choice for me personally but work fantastically for someone else. My husband tried it out too, as a way to adjust between graveyard shift and ""normal"" daytime hours over days off. He says it works really great for that, gives a boost that helps him wake up when he gets to that early evening ""slump."" So it may be a good choice for shift workers too.I do find the light to be very, very intense and somewhat unpleasant. It reminds me of the blue bilirubin-eliminating lights used on jaundiced babies in the NICU. I have to be careful about how I position it or I start to get a headache.

"I recently purchased an oral thermometer from the same company, iProven, and it is fantastic. I'm glad to say that this ear thermometer from them is just as good, maybe better.One of the best things about it is how fast it gives you a reading. Only a few seconds is what you need to get an accurate temperature, and let's be honest, it's hard to get a child to sit still for much longer than that.  The display is also very easy to read, which is excellent because a lot of times this will be used at night.The best thing however is that it's just so easy to use. Kids (and adults for that matter) just don't have the patience to sit around and wait for an oral thermometer to give a reading, or for anything else. With the iProven thermometer you get a device that gives you a fast, easy reading so that you can get it done without everyone getting all stressed out.So, I'm glad to say that just like the oral thermometer from iProven, their ear thermometer is excellent quality, very accurate, works well and takes a temperature very quickly!

"My daughter turns 1 in 2 weeks.

I like that the tip is flexible because, let's face it, babies don't always sit still (LOL).  Unlike other thermometers I've used this one is very consistent.  I've done more than a few tests to make sure it was reading correctly and, every time, it was almost exactly the same.I'd give it a 10 out of 10 for build, reliability, accuracy and price.

"Let me start this review by coming clean and saying that, under normal circumstances, I would not have read this book.  I'm not a fantasy fan, or a romance fan, or a fantasy romance fan.  LOLThat being said, I was highly recommended Reluctant Gods from a close female friend and she's never wrong about what I will like. Suffice to say she was dead-on yet again.Reluctant Gods starts grabbed me right from the start. Author A.J. Aaron has impressive skills that are, frankly, often lacking here on Amazon. To put it succinctly, he can actually write, and write well.  His characters are fully fleshed out (even when they're not in the flesh) and the settings and surroundings came to life in my mind's eye quite vividly.The story is well put together also.  It moves along at a brisk pace but, when necessary, slows down to allow the reader some time to take in the scenery, so to speak.  It's a timeless love story with a twist, combining elements of romance, science fiction and wish-fulfillment (with liberal doses of adult-oriented situations thrown in to get the blood flowing, of course).What it is, if nothing else, is a fun, sexy and surprising tale about 2 broken people separated by time and fate that, miraculously, come back together and heal each other.What I liked about Reluctant Gods was that it surprised me.  It got into my head and left a little something behind that still has me thinking about it a week after I finished reading, and thats something that very rarely happens with me. Is it my favorite book ever?  No, but any writer who laves an image in my minds eye for anything longer than a few hours is a writer worth reading, and worth recommending.Which is what Im here to do.  Read Reluctant Gods. It will surprise you, put a smile on your face, a tingle in your heart and leave a little mark on your soul.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOSPXN0BDUAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IQ5VXM#wasThisHelpful","R1QOSPXN0BDUAD","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While finding out that I'm a `gorilla' didn't exactly make me happy, I must say that the tips and advice in this book, for the most part, are right on the money.  As an overweight person for most of my life, I'm doing everything I can these days to stay slim,  which includes being very vigilant about what I put in my body every day. The advice that I've found so far in this relatively small but helpful book has been excellent.What I can say is that Living The Thin Life  is definitely helpful for people who have already lost weight and want to keep it off. The author, Elle Meyer, writes in a very refreshing style and, even though she's not a trained nutritionist, much of what she has to say, and the advice that she gives, is very helpful.I will say this; I use Garcinia Cambogia regularly to help me keep my hunger cravings down and the combination of that and the weight loss tips and suggestions on how to eat healthy and stay active in this book have been excellent.

"After spending more than 30 years as an overweight person, I devoted myself in the last few years to eating healthy, nutritious meals that are low in fat and calories. The problem is of course that, many times, those meals are also low on  taste.A few weeks back my ex-wife (go figure) told me about The Skinnytaste Cookbook. She knows I'm always looking for new recipes and I have to say, her recommendation was a really good one.  I've tried almost a dozen recipes so far and they are easy to prepare, taste amazing and are somehow still low in sugar, calories and fat! (My favorite so far, even though it's not actually a meal, are the heavenly banana nut oat muffins.)One habit that I have gotten into is to take Garcinia Cambogia  with every meal, and it's been a fantastic combination with the recipes in this cookbook.

"I've been reading and watching Drew Canole ever since I actually wrote about his company back in 2011, so when I saw that his new book, The 10 Day Smoothie Challenge, had been published here on Amazon, I purchased it right away. I absolutely love smoothies and not only does Drew create some of the best I've ever had, the combinations of delicious, healthy ingredients that he puts together are fantastic! Of course one of the best reasons to read and use this awesome book and program is because it will definitely help you lose weight, and fast! To that end, I also took Garcinia Cambogia along with a smoothie every morning during the 10 day challenge and the results were phenomenal! If you're looking to lose weight fast, and feel incredible too,  I highly recommend this book and program!  It helped me lose almost 10 pounds and I feel great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1U7CZAIQQYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8E1ESK#wasThisHelpful","R2J1U7CZAIQQYS","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive tried Sulbutiamine in the past and have always enjoyed it. I find it gives me a good buzz in the morning in terms of focus, motivation, and memory. It puts me in a better mood and makes starting the work day go much more smoothly. Ive almost completely cut coffee out my work day. The only time I drink it now is when I am cycling off Sulbutiamine. (Sulbutiamines biggest downside is how quickly one builds a tolerance).I tried this vendor for the first time and am extremely pleased. Product was double sealed and very professionally done. As someone who has purchased many obscure racetam nootropics from online vendors in the past, I found the products presentation to be very refreshing. After using the product for a week, I feel like the buzz I get is a little stronger than what I have experienced with other vendors. Maybe this is primarily due to the placebo effect created by the products presentation but I am definitely satisfied with this purchase. I got this product for free in a nootropic giveaway in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXME948KFGYE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOT32OY#wasThisHelpful","RXME948KFGYE1","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fianc and I welcomed our little baby girl, Valery, into the world about eight months ago and she now can sit up on her own and is playing with her baby toys all the time.I know from experience that little children are extremely curious and love pictures and, when I saw the My First Family Photo Album on Amazon, I knew she would love it!We got it about a week ago and, just like I thought, its now her favorite thing to look at, hold onto and, of course, put in her mouth. (She is just a baby after all.)The photo album is really fantastic in every way. First, its made of a very heavy duty plastic that Im sure will last through all of the rough handling it will go through in the next few months and years. We have already put 12 pictures in it, with the faces of everyone in the family including us of course as well as her grandparents, one brother and two sisters. (It holds 15 pictures so we still have a couple more to go.)Valery absolutely loves looking at those pictures and, since the plastic is nice and thick, they dont get damaged by her little hands or by all of the drool and spit that gets on it all the time.Whats even better is that theres a mirror included on the back page of the album so that she can look at herself. Its baby safe of course and theres no need to worry about  It breaking because its not glass.Theres a small loop on top of the album so that you can hang it wherever you like, which makes it easy when we go for our daily long walks, and makes sure that it doesnt get lost or accidentally thrown out of the stroller.What we really like most about it though is that Valery gets to see pictures of her relatives, most of whom dont live close by, on a regular basis. We want her to know who the other people in her family are so that, when we visit them, she will already recognize them.The fact is, we are so pleased with the Album that were going to order a couple more of them so that we can leave one in her stroller all the time and have one for her playpen and crib too.If you have an infant or small child and want  them to be able to have fun while also familiarizing themselves with other members of your family and friends, the My First Family Photo Album is a fantastic choice. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQQ5KN1SIRJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMSMYWG#wasThisHelpful","R2KQQ5KN1SIRJ8","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ive been battling weight problems since I was a teenager and have tried just about everything under the sun to not just lose weight but also keep it off for more than just a few days or weeks.Of course since I havent been living under a rock I have heard of Garcinia Cambogia for the last few years but, thinking that it was just a fad and wouldnt really help me, I never tried any of the dozens of products out there.Frankly, I was also worried about any side effects that I might have but, when my sister-in-law started using Garcinia Cambogia from Nutrivion (she bought it on Amazon just like I did) and got great results, I decided to put my fears aside and try the product for myself.Rather than keep you in suspense, I will just say this; Im extremely pleased with the results that I have had so far. After about three days I really noticed that my hunger, which usually would get out of control around the middle of the afternoon, was almost nonexistent. Although I was worried that my mood was going to be all sorts of crazy, the fact is that I have felt very calm and relaxed over the last couple of weeks since I started taking the product and, most importantly, Ive lost almost 8 pounds!With most diet products that I have tried over the years (and boy, have I tried a lot of them) the product usually works for a few days and then my hunger just keeps building until I want to explode and I gorge myself on the worst kinds of foods.Im happy to say that this hasnt happened at all. Not only do I feel great, but Im not suffering in the afternoons and evenings from uncontrollable hunger like I used to before. Even better, I dont snack before bedtime, which I have read is the worst thing that you can do if youre trying to lose weight.I've also noticed that, when I do sit down for a meal, I can eat smaller portions and still walk away from the table feeling satisfied. That in itself is wonderful because Im the type of person that usually goes back for seconds, thirds and more.I wanted to write this review because I know there are a lot of people suffering the way I did and I want to let them know that Garcinia Cambogia  really does work.This is the only brand that I have tried and, frankly, its the only one that I will be using because it has been working extremely well. I highly recommend it and I wish everyone out there who has suffered from weight problems like me the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VY6CSA6XQTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI0MVUS#wasThisHelpful","R15VY6CSA6XQTF","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This organic tea tree oil from WellnessScent is at the top of my list now however because it's just so much better than anything else I've used.

"The reason I bought this was because, when I read the description on Amazon, I was so impressed by the features that this grow light was manufactured with. The ability to replace a single diode is not only amazing but amazingly cost-effective, and using aluminum to increase the reflective light was brilliant. The fact that I've actually started paying less for my electric bill is also impressive but, of course, the real question is whether or not my plants like the new lights.They definitely do.

I got the recommendation for these from a magazine and purchased several to 'daisy chain' together.  I have to say that the results that I've had so far have been very favorable, using them was easy and my electric bill only went up about 21%.  I was expecting around 40 so that was a nice surprise. The fact that you can easily change out a damaged diode is brilliant too!  I also like the ability to dim the lights for different types of growth.

I love riding and I wanted to get Alex something that was lightweight, didn't go too fast and gave him the experience he needed to move up to a bigger bike.

"Considering his age, I'd say that the author, Ethan Taylor, has quite a future in writing science fiction novels.  This first try was a smashing success!The book is very cute, and the character, while not particularly well-drawn, is cute too.  It's hard not to think back to the days when you were a child yourself as you read Ethan's book, and reminisce on times that were simpler and carefree.I recommend this to parents who want to read something to inspire their children to use their creativity and imagination.

"After reading the first book in the Ana Martin series I was definitely hooked. The author has a style that Im really enjoying and the first book left me with some lasting impressions and thoughts. In other words, I was definitely ready for more and have been coming back since.Frozen Flame is Lyneal Jenkins best book by far in my opinion, and it made for a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. These characters have become like friends to me and the final storyline, with the usual twists and turns that the author loves, couldnt have been more satisfying.The character of Ana is on a par with any heroine being written about today and, although there are a number of clichs that the author relies on, she does it with such style that you can easily forgive her.If you love strong female characters, a well written yarn that will keep you guessing throughout and a fully realized world on a par with Tolkien, Frozen Flame is definitely a must read.

"My friend bought me two of these recently for my birthday and I have to say that I'm very pleased with them. I have been practicing yoga for over 10 years and didn't think there was much more I could learn or do to improve my stretches but these have helped so much! As I've gotten older it has become a little more difficult to stay balanced when I do deep stretches in some positions and the yoga straps have  made some of my stretches a lot easier. Also, we stretch together now using these and it's not only very helpful but also a lot of fun!  If you would have told me something so simple would add so much to my yoga routine I would have probably just brushed it off in the past but I can say with all honesty that these yoga straps have definitely made a difference. Highly recommended, no matter what level of yoga you happen to practice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTOMX7U5ZYE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJA69TA#wasThisHelpful","RCTOMX7U5ZYE7","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using this about 6 weeks ago and I have to say that I am very happy with the results. I've lost almost 20 pounds, I feel great and there have been none of the side effects I've had with some other products.My energy levels have been high (but not too high) and my appetite a LOT lower. I don't think there's much more to say than awesome product.I'm almost at my goal weight and I've purchased more since the first bottle.

"My nephew Tom got into DJ-ing a few years back as a hobby in high school and loved it so much that he decided to try and make it as a professional. He's really a great kid and I know he's serious about it, so when he asked me for some money to get a more professional setup I told him that I would give him what he needed but I wanted to be part of the decision-making process. That's when I started looking and found Dragon Frontboards.Our budget wasn't tiny but it wasn't big either, but the guys and gals at Dragon took care of us as if we were spending big money. Honestly, I was surprised at how affordable the booth is, as well as how durable it seems to be so far. It's also easy to carry and very portable, which is great because Tom doesn't have a very big car.The best thing though is that it really looks fantastic and makes him look like a total pro. The first time he said it all up and put on the LED lights I was absolutely floored!Anyway, I'm glad to say that Tom's DJ business is doing great and a lot of it is thanks to the DJ booth we got from Dragon Frontboards. One last thing I'll mention that's important is simply that the Lycra fabric panels are easy to clean, which is great because, like most young guys, Tom is a bit of a slob.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQSB1ANDRY0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TDT3AM#wasThisHelpful","RQQSB1ANDRY0T","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Night of the Fae a few months back and, when I did, I mentioned that I couldn't wait for the sequel. Well, it finally got here and I have to say that I think I like Hidden Light even better!In the first book we were introduced to Ana,  possibly one of the most well-written female characters that I've come across in quite some time. This time around she's grown up quite a bit (due to the extraordinary experiences that she had in book 1 of course), and her character has gotten stronger, more willful and, at least for me, much more interesting.Author Lyneal Jenkins is a simply wonderful storyteller and she manages to intertwine the fantasy elements of Hidden Light  with quite a bit of action and a generous portion of intrigue and drama as well.I won't give away any of the story because it's just too good for ""spoilers"" but I can say that  you will definitely enjoy watching Jenkins' characters,  and their world, come to intricate and in-depth life.I enjoyed this book thoroughly, just like the first in the series, and I look forward to the next with more anticipation than I would ever have guessed. This is one of the first series I've read here on Amazon that has done this for me. If you're looking for an excellent read by  a crafty, gifted author,  Hidden Light should really do the trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TJYQ3YHH9YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKCUKGA#wasThisHelpful","R8TJYQ3YHH9YN","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got wax recently for myself from BodyHonee and it worked so well that my girlfriend started using it.  We then saw here on Amazon that they had these waxing strips and, since their wax was so darn good, my sweetie decided to get these too for her legs.  Just like the first product these work really well.  They're super gentle but also pretty durable at the same time.  She complains about wax strips that rip but not with these! The wax also doesn't 'seep through' like with a lot of wax strips,  and for $10 you get 100 of them which is really a super deal!

We're both extremely pleased with the results and now my girlfriend is going to start using it on her own legs too.

"Listen, we all know that zombies are freaking everywhere today and, let's face it, the tales can get a little 'similar' after a while.  Is The Apocalypse the best zombie tale ever written?  No, but it's damn good. The word 'gritty' really fits this book well, and author Peter Meredith's writing style fits perfectly with the subject matter.  There are some parts that really took my breath away I can tell you that.  Great character development too, and the ending was absolutely fantastic!  Of all the zombie books I've read (and there have been a few) this is one of the best, seriously.  It had more or a 'real' feel to it than most, definitely.

"I actually got this for my birthday and I have to say that it's definitely worth every penny that the person who bought it for me paid. LOL!  Seriously though, I've been practicing Yoga for a number of years and I've had several different mats. This one is probably one of the best I've ever had simply because, even when I'm dripping with sweat, I don't slip and slide all of the place. It's also extremely convenient because it folds very small and take up little space in my car (I keep it there). One last thing; unlike some of the others I had, this mat doesn't stink. I mean that literally. Many of the others I've used, after a few weeks or even a few days, begin to stink.  For whatever reason this one doesn't even though I've used it for a few weeks now.

"This book should seriously be on every guy's reading list.  I know that some guys can approach women more easily than others, but most don't have that ability (including yours truly). Pickup Lines Don't Work is like a college education on how to talk to women and will help practically every guy get better at it.It's actually a great read too, and was very engaging from page 1. It proved to me that everything in life is a skill that can be practiced and perfected. Talk about a self-improvement eye-opener!  I am now on my way to be a master of mingling and an expert on starting conversations and engaging with the ladies, all from a book that was really a breeze to read.I've actually read it twice now. Yes, it's that good. I was so overwhelmed at the idea that I could practice and become better at talking to women, and the possibilities that would soon be my reality, that I couldn't sleep for a few days!If you're looking for information on how to become a master at talking to women, not just some dumb jerk with stale pick-up lines that women hate, READ THIS BOOK.

"If you're the parent of a swimmer then you know that all those short trips back and forth to the pool, and all those longer ones to swim meets on the weekend, can be like torture. Torture for your kid if they have nothing to do, and torture for you if you have to sit there and listen to them complain that they have nothing to do.  (Been there, done that.)Yeah, there are apps and smartphone games aplenty out there but sometimes they can get a little boring. Your child might also be too young to really enjoy them, or you simply may not want them to play those types of games, and that's where the Swim Meet Activity Book really comes in handy.I'm a child of the 70's and we used to have these for everything. These days they are few and far between though, unfortunately. This one is geared towards swimmers of course, and loaded with games, puzzles and even 'Mad Libs' that the kids can create, fill-in and answer while riding in the car back and forth to meets.  Great stuff!The last meet we had I brought this and my son Alex and his buddies thought it was great!  They loved the Mad Libs of course, but the other activities were popular too.  I was surprised to be honest because they are all between 12 and 14 and I thought they would think it was 'boring'.  They didn't, and the trip was a blast for all of us!For younger kids this would be absolutely perfect, and for parents of swimmers looking for a little relief from all that constant nagging and repeated cries of 'are we there yet?!', this will be a godsend. I hope they make more.

"I just finished reading The Mind Shaman for the 2nd time and I have to say, I'm still blown away by some of the ideas and insights that author Luca Bosurgi packed into his book.I guess I should say Dr. Bosurgi because the guy has more degrees than probably 4 other men put together.  I consider myself intelligent but I think he's on another level entirely.The book starts out with what I first thought was a bit of a deceit; the life of a young man as told by that young man from pre-birth until his early 20's.  Yes, I said pre-birth. The story begins when 'Liam"" is conceived and follows him through 9 months of pregnancy (inside his mother, of course) until the day he's born, than onward as he matures from baby, to child and finally to adult.  It's a unique and thought-provoking look a how a human life is 'started', that's for sure, and although I can't say I loved this part I will say that it was a very interesting look a the world from inside the mind of a child.Once 'Liam' is an adult however the story begins to really take shape and we meet the esteemed Dr. Bosurgi.  I can't say that I understood everything about 'Bosurgi Syndrome', named after the author, but I can say that the theories and ideas that were introduced had me thinking own life and the relationships and emotional ties I had with my parents (both of whom are deceased).If you're considering reading The Mind Shaman book (and I highly recommend it) you should know this; you won't be the same after you're finished. As I mentioned I have read it twice already and I'm keeping it on my night table for reference over the next few weeks.  It's deep, metaphysical stuff that will stick to your brain like velcro, and the actual syndrome discussed may well hold the key to some of my own, how shall I say, deficiencies.This is NOT light reading by any means.  It will open your mind (maybe too much) and force you to do some actual thinking and contemplation.  If you're not ready for that you might not want to pick it up to be perfectly honest, but if you're looking for a book that will stick in your mind and open your eyes to how the human psyche really works, as well as find some answers about your own life, The Mind Shaman is that book.  I recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVSSUWS61BG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU76TI8#wasThisHelpful","R1JVSSUWS61BG5","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it, getting kids to sit down and read a book today is no small feat. My daughter hasn't read a book in ages and she's not really big on the 'fantasy/adventure genre.  Luckily however, I am.This is a book geared towards teens or, as they say today 'young adults' / YA.  With that in mind I wasn't expecting the kind of thoughts and ideas that author SE Sledden presented, and I say that in a very good way.  She doesn't talk down to her audience in any way and the main character, Tillie, is a firecracker of a girl in the mold of Merida from Brave, the recent Disney/Pixar film.She's contemptuous of all things 'adult', as you might guess, and wants nothing more than to escape to 'something better', even though she has no idea what that might be.It's standard teen angst fare, to be sure, but told in a charming way that really held me in sway for a few solid hours.  I wish my daughter would read this, I really do.  I think she would appreciate the similarities that this fictional character has with her own real life.  Maybe I can convince her...In any case, if your daughter is an avid reader this is a wonderful, charming and thought provoking book, no question.  A great lead character, well-rounded surrounding cast, plenty of surprises, lots of adventure and solid 'coming of age' type stuff.  All beautifully written to boot!

"When a new book reminds you of a classic you know it's a good one, and this one reminded me of Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Huck Finn' quite a bit. it's been a long time since I read a book that was so much fun.I bought it for my son and he liked it so much that he said that I ""had to!"" read it, He reads quite a few books and is quite the young critic so I took his advice.  The Treasure at Devils Hole has all the markings of a classic adventure. There's treasure to be found of course, as well as a scary nemesis, quirky sidekicks and a pretty girl waiting to be won. Author Jody Mabry certainly knows his way around a good yarn and sets up this instant classic for a lot of great payoffs at the end.It's definitely a lot of fun and I can understand why my son enjoyed it. What young man (or older man, for that matter) doesn't dream of going off on a treasure hunt with his best buddies or brothers? It's the quintessential American adventure and has a universal appeal that Mabry taps into with great aplomb. I got swept up in the adventure myself and ended up reading it in one sitting.This book definitely has a lot going for it. It's got a great tale, fully fleshed out characters that you can visualize quite easily in your minds eye and enough twists and turns to keep even the most finicky of readers interested from start to finish. It also has quite a few laughs and I was quite surprised at how deftly the author was able to handle the comedic side of the story.I would recommend this for any young reader that's looking for a great adventure story with some fun, thrills and laughs thrown in for good measure. My son and I both enjoyed it quite a bit and both of us recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NLB7E5SMXTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TM7W9Y#wasThisHelpful","R37NLB7E5SMXTJ","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get hangovers very easily. Usually I will experience a headache and nausea after five or six drinks. I have looked into other hangover prevention products (mostly nothing but vitamin blends) but havent had much luck. Finally I decided to give this a try and was pleased with the results. The product works, but I have noticed that its effectives declines when an extreme amount of alcohol is consumed. See below for an explanation of what I mean.1. If I drink 5-7 drinks in a night and take two capsules the DHM relieves 100% of all hangover symptoms.2. If I drink 8-10 drinks in a night and take three capsules the DHM relieves 80-90% of all hangover symptoms3. If I drink 11-13 drinks in a night and take three capsules the DHM relieves 50-60% of all hangover symptoms4. Id I drink 14+ (which I dont do often and dont recommend anyone ever drinks this much), in a night and take three capsules the DHM relieves 25-35% of my hangover symptoms.I have found that if I keep it under 10 drinks this stuff eliminates all (or almost all) of my hangover symptoms.But, if you plan on getting obliterated to the point you black out and expect to wake up the next morning without any hangover symptoms you are out of luck. It will help, but it wont work any miracles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P38IC5BCWZF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX60CMA#wasThisHelpful","R3P38IC5BCWZF1","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I suppose the first thing that I should admit before starting this review is that I'm quite skeptical about any claims of psychic powers.Okay, now that I've gotten that out of the way I can admit that I actually enjoyed this book quite a bit and was surprised at some of the ideas, thoughts and real-world applications that author Embrosewyn Tazkuvel has jam packed into this excellent read. From using the inborn psychic powers that all of us have to increase focus and for self defense, all the way to telepathy and telekinesis, the argument for everyone having innate psychic abilities that he makes is very strong indeed.The most important question is simply this; does it work? To that I will also answer honestly that, in my extremely recent experience with reading the book and using some of the information I found, it actually might. I don't want someone to purchase this book because I said that ""yes, it will help you to be a psychic!"" but it did open my eyes to the possibility and, coming from a lifelong skeptic, that's saying something. even more telling is that I plan on rereading it again.No matter your belief, it's a well-written and extremely interesting book. The author's writing style took a little bit of getting used to but once I had gone through a few pages I found myself unable to put the book down. If you've always been intrigued about whether or not psychic abilities are ""for real"" or maybe that you have some of your own, this is definitely the book that you want to read. I have no problem recommending it highly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZTUC49GN5ZLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HBKIKP4#wasThisHelpful","R1ZTUC49GN5ZLQ","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone that knows me knows that I am a fanatic for cookbooks. Not any kind of cookbook either, but cookbooks that lean towards healthy, easy and quick to make recipes that don't take a ton of prep time. I am not trying to be a gourmet chef, I just want to be able to whip up something healthy and delicious without spending half a day in the kitchen.That's why I like this book. Author Lynn Ahbonbon knows her way around the kitchen and some of the recipes I found in her book are not just easy to make but absolutely delish. On the healthy side, they're low in fat and empty carbs, which I really appreciate and bonus, my kids have (so far) loved every recipe that I've made.Two standouts are her Coq au vin (chicken in wine), a dish from France that my mom used to make when we were kids that I haven't had in years, and also the Butternut Squash Soup which was super fast to make and really yummy.Anyway, as you can see, I really like this book and I'm looking forward to making quite a few more of her recipes.this is one cookbook that really delivers on its promise.

"Look, I'm not going to sit here and try and convince you that this is the best book I've ever read. To be perfectly straight it threw me a little bit at first because of the ideas and images that it was talking about. After reading it first time I wasn't really sure exactly what I had just read, but I kept thinking about it anyway.So I went back and read it again. The second time around I really opened my mind to what the book was trying to tell me and what the author was trying to say. I'm glad I did because the second time was definitely the charm.Many of the themes In the book touched home with me, like being alone in the universe, trying to find out why we're here and what we're meant to be or do.  Like Kerouac himself the main character in the book is searching but he's not exactly sure what he searching for.What I will say about 'The Man Who Followed Jack Kerouac' is that, if you take your time and really listen to what author Christina Westover is saying, you will come away a changed person. For me, that definitely makes the book worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGUFQJMKMGGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1494347202#wasThisHelpful","R2CGUFQJMKMGGC","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a repeat reader of author Tim Houston's books (I read 'Leads to Referrals' not too long ago) and, while this new book is well written, insightful and definitely helpful, I was kind of hoping for just a little bit more in the way of unique techniques to help me with the process of generating more referrals and more business.That being said, Houston's newest book 'The Referral Rules! 7 Ways to Get More Profitable Referrals' is still an excellent book that, for the beginner as well as the seasoned veteran, gives heaping helpings of great advice for generating referrals and keeping customers happy.  I have no problem at all recommending it and, compared to other books on the subject, it is a definite standout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMD0UW9BX1GV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKAFVBC#wasThisHelpful","R1KMD0UW9BX1GV","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive owned 2 different types of small businesses including a health food store and several massage/day spas. Recently I was presented the opportunity to purchase a hair and beauty salon but, since Im not experienced with that type of business, I decided to search for help online before making my decision.I found Hair Salon Marketing: Achieve Greater S.U.C.C.E.S.S. With Less here on Amazon and decided to give it a full read. Im very glad I did to because not only is it extremely well written but it had so much excellent information on marketing for not only a hair salon but for small businesses in general that its definitely going into my must re-read marketing library. Author Tony Jackson truly knows what hes talking about and the advice he gives is just as good for the beginner (like me) as it is for someone whos been in the industry for decades.Even if youre just a stylist who has her own (or his own) chair at a local salon this book will definitely help you to increase your client base and your repeat business. And thats the point, because the hair salon industry thrives on new business and repeat customers. As with most small businesses, without a constant influx of new people about the only place youll be going is belly up.My wife and I still arent sure if or going to be buying this hair salon but, thanks to this excellent book, if we do Im certain that it will be successful.

"Amber Shea Crawley is my new hero!  This is a fantastic cookbook, filled with not only a ton of yummy recipes but also lots of information and advice hat anyone can use to slowly but surely ease their way into a raw food diet.  I have a little bit of experience (I owned a health food store for 7 years) but I have never seen such a great collection of recipes and info all in one place.

"Okay, Im going to admit this right at the start. Being nearly 40 years old I am probably way too old to be reading a book like this. The Latecomers Fan Club is definitely leaning towards the young adult crowd, and I am no longer a young adult by any means. That being said, I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. I think the main reason is that it really reminded me about how great, and how messed up, things were when I was in my 20s.I actually got this book because a colleague of mine (a woman in her early 30s) was raving about it one day at work. She was so enthused that I asked her the name of the book and picked it up a couple of days later. There are three main characters and author Diane V. Mulligan jumps around between the three of them, giving their viewpoints and narrating her story from the same. I really liked that a lot as most books only give you the inner thoughts and viewpoint of one character.Mostly though I really enjoyed how realistic the story was. From the people to the settings, the situations and feelings, it all felt very familiar to me and really brought back a lot of fond (and maybe a few not so fond) memories of when I was making my way through young adulthood and making all sorts of stupid mistakes. I got my heart broken, dated the wrong women, stayed at enough crappy jobs to last a lifetime and broke a few hearts myself during that time, and this book reminded me why I wouldnt want to change a single thing.Being from the Northeast myself a lot of the settings were very familiar and, even though Im a guy, the insight that I got from the viewpoint of both Maggie and Abby was not just interesting but refreshing. Nathaniel reminded me of myself (although Ive never been much of a musician). Hes a nice guy at heart but just doesnt get the fact that women need more than he can give. Talk about familiar.Anyway, while the opinion of a guy in his late 30s might not be very valuable to the target audience of this book, if youd like my opinion Ill tell you that this is an excellent story from an excellent author and well worth wrapping your mind around for a few hours. It has compelling characters, a great storyline and is extremely insightful and, at times, quite moving. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCXSNCLQ2J9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBFVBCY#wasThisHelpful","R3BCXSNCLQ2J9S","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found Black White and Shades of Greyy (The Within Greyy Line) to be an extremely interesting book and one of the most original stories that I have read in the last few months. Im not a huge fan of Pirates but when a book is written this well Ill take a great seafaring adventure any day. Theres also the fact that this book incorporates a bit of fantasy as well (the lead character, Greyylene, is an elf) as well as quite a bit of rip roaring mayhem and suspense. When you add it all up it amounts to a fun read that should quench the thirst of anyone looking for a bit of rollicking adventure.Author ElissaBeth Frear is obviously a very creative writer and gives the book just the right tone, somewhere between swashbuckling adventure and romantic comedy.  Her characters are full of life, to say least, and the settings and locations that Frear describes seem to jump off the page. If youre a fan of all things pirate or you just looking for a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a few hours, you could do far worse than to get Black White and Shades of Greyy I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W43KUDPPCH1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3E8XFM#wasThisHelpful","R3W43KUDPPCH1G","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just turned 50 and Ive heard about hypnosis many times over the years but, to be honest, I never really gave it much thought or respect. That all changed about 5 years ago when a colleague of mine went through a quick and drastic change because of hypnosis. He was an alcoholic and, when he drank alcohol, he also smoked cigarettes. He knew it was a problem and went to a hypnotherapist for help, seeing him for 2 sessions over 2 days. That was 5 years ago and he hasnt had a drink or smoked a cigarette since, something that still amazes me to this day.Its because of this that I picked up Self Hypnosis As You Read.  Its actually the sequel to another book written by author Forbes Robbins Blair called Instant Self  Hypnosis and, now that Ive read this book, Im quite eager to find and read the first.Both books have an incredibly interesting proposition that the author, an accomplished hypnotherapist, discovered on his own; anyone, no matter who they are or what they believe, can hypnotize themself while they read words out loud. Im talking about reading a book with your eyes wide open and going into a  hypnotic state while doing it. Indeed, both of his books have allowed thousands of people to self-hypnotize in the comfort of their own home and that would now include me.Now, frankly, if you would have told me that this was possible before I read Blairs book I would probably have laughed in contempt (or at least giggled a little bit) but, after having read the book and actually using his techniques on myself, I am completely convinced that his technique works. In fact, Im amazed at how easy it was and at some of the results that Ive already had in my life after reading his book.As I was reading his book (specifically, the parts meant to be read for self-hypnosis) I actually went into a relaxed and hypnotized state. (It was really something.) Blairs book gives 42 specific goals that you can address using his technique.  As of now I have used 2 of them including Override the Fear of Rejection and Tinnitus Relief and, no lie, my tinnitus has gone down considerably as well as the fear of rejection that I have had for many years. (Im a writer and a former chiropractor and I thought it was part and parcel of both.)Self Hypnosis As You Read was written for the layman and as such it is extremely easy to understand, easy to read and also very well written to boot. I have already purchased 2 more copies to send to a friend of mine and my ex-wife, both of whom suffer from a couple of problems that Blairs book addresses.Many people have the same bias towards hypnotherapy that I used to have but, if thats you, I can say with 100% conviction that this book has opened my eyes to a new and amazing idea. Not only that but it has actually helped me and I look forward to using it for a number of other problem areas in my life.At the end of the day, it certainly is a heck of a lot less expensive than any other kind of therapy I have ever used and, better yet, it actually works.

"It doesn't take a genius to realize that there are a metric ton of ""how-to"" books being written these days. I know, because I've read quite a few of them. In my 49 years I've been a moving & storage salesman, a chiropractor, the owner of a health food store and I'm currently a writer. I've also learned two languages on my own (Dutch and Spanish). So, when I tell you I've read a number of how-to books, I'm not exaggerating. (Margarita Madrigal's Magic Book of Spanish is a great how-to book if you want to learn Spanish. Just FYI.)I was actually given ""Get Paid to Speak: How I Went From a Poor Utah Teacher to a Rich Speaker in Just 6 Months!"" by a friend of mine who knows that I am interested in becoming a public speaker. To be honest, I have already done quite a bit of public speaking but on a very small scale. When I was practicing chiropractic in Peru I would give weekly ""charlas"" or speeches to groups of new patients ranging from three or four up to 40 or 50 depending on the week. This is an excellent way to build a chiropractic practice and I know that there are lots of people who make a living from public speaking but I didn't really know the nuts and bolts about it.This book, as I said in the title, is possibly one of the best how-to books I've ever read. Author Russ Johnson has, like me, had a very interesting professional life and done quite a few different things professionally. (We're also just about the same age.)  His book is extremely well written, organized and straightforward. As he says right in the beginning it's not going to show someone how to ""get rich quick"" but I can attest to the fact that, if you're looking for information on how to start a public speaking career, this is definitely one of the first books you should read. I have already started using some of the excellent information in order to make the transition and set up the contacts I need.Johnson gives step-by-step instructions on what to do, what not to do, and most importantly, how to turn your life and career experiences into something viable and valuable that people will pay you to hear. From the basics about how to be `found' through getting over your fear of public speaking and finding paying gigs, this book has it all.  For me it's been a revelation and I'm looking forward to the next up in my life which is going to be as a public speaker. If that something that you aspire to, buy this book first. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VE59UJF4NIMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FROUC20#wasThisHelpful","R2VE59UJF4NIMB","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a kid my parents used to play games like Pictionary and I used to hate it because they would always make us go to bed early and then keep playing the game after we went to bed. I would be in my bedroom listening to the squeals of laughter from downstairs in the den and be jealous that they were having so much fun, wondering why they were squealing like kids too.Today my wife and I have a fairly active social life and we were looking for a game to play that was similar and recently found You're Pulling My Leg, a great game that is sort of like a ""truth or dare"" from years ago. In it you basically tell stories about yourself, some of them false and some of them true, and try and get the people playing with you to decide whether the stories are true or not. It's a heck of a great way to get to know your friends and neighbors a lot better and open up some fun conversations. As a way to sort of ""break the ice"" at parties it's excellent and gets the whole gang laughing.Just like when we were kids we let ours join in the fun until bedtime and then, once they're safely tucked away, the real fun begins. After a little bit of wine you'll be amazed what you find out about even your best friends and occasionally your spouse as well.If your next dinner party isn't as fun as you'd like, I would definitely suggest whipping out You're Pulling My Leg. Before long things will get a lot more fun, I guarantee. I recommend it highly, especially if you and your circle of friends are close and like a good laugh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8PB2LOJGJ1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AM2LMI#wasThisHelpful","RP8PB2LOJGJ1I","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids are both big fans of Jim Carrey and his ""Pet Detective"" movies so, when I saw this game, I quickly bought it for them and crossed my fingers that they would like it.  The reason I crossed my fingers is because, with all of the video games and smart phone games that kids like these days (including mine) it's really hard to get them interested in a ""regular"" board game anymore.  It seems that these kind of games aren't ""cool"".Anyway, I can't really tell you how the game works or what the object is but it does have something that both my kids like a lot which is  cute, furry animals. Not only that but, with the four ""custom"" cards they actually can make game cards with pics of our own pets in them.  (1 dog, 2 cats, 1 rabbit and several fish.) I thought that this feature was really cool myself and the kids have a lot of fun switching out the pictures with new ones that they take and print out here at home.All I can say is that if any game can keep my kids occupied for more than five minutes it has to be a good one and, since the kids have been playing this for a few weeks now (and sharing it with their friends) it's got to be really, really good. That's about the highest praise that I can give any type of board game, so if you are worried that your kids are becoming video game zombies, get them Pet Detectives and let them have some honest-to-goodness fun with an old-fashioned board game for a change. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUOWVZIRDIGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CCDT1S#wasThisHelpful","R1XUOWVZIRDIGY","A1TXFC3JOKYQQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TXFC3JOKYQQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You're Pulling My Leg! Junior is one of the best games I have purchased for my family in a long time. I was actually starting to think that my kids were getting a little bit too old to play games with my wife and I but we have had so much fun playing this game that I wish I would've gotten it ages ago.  I'm a professional writer and my kids are always asking me how I come up with some of the stories that I write. Well, this game is certainly a good way to become a great storyteller.The object of the game is to fool the other people with stories (both true and false) and try to make them ""believable"". It promotes plenty of creativity, that's for sure. (I just hope they don't use it against us when they get older and start dating and driving the car.) This is definitely a good game for older kids although if your younger ones have a vivid imagination they would probably enjoy it as well.My son had a birthday recently and he and his friends played this game for hours during the party and the subsequent sleepover. My daughter has also talked about it with lots of friends because she really enjoys it. For me, anything that can bring the family a little closer together for some good times and lots of laughs is good by me. The metal tin is also great because it takes a lot of abuse and doesn't fall apart like some boxed games.

"This book is highly researched and well thought-out and when you add up and evaluate all of the parts of this book, its a most impressive effort but thats to be expected when you consider the dedication of Mr Lawrence along with the deep pool of experience and support of the Dupuy organization.The book begins with a bountiful Prolog/Prehistory (roughly 350 pages) It includes war history as well as immediate pre battle conditions, preparations and assessments of both sides for the upcoming operation. This preface mentions Kharkov and Stalingrad but also Leningrad and Moscow as well as a myriad of other topics not directly related to Operation Citadel. I found these topics interesting though some weren't essential to Operation Citadel. One topic of interest concerns: Did Germany have a chance to defeat Russia. Despite the German kill ratios being higher than the enemy's, the reserve pool of draftees for the Soviets were too large and the Red Army would be able to outlast the Germans in this extended war. In other words could the Germans bleed the Soviets white before they had to surrender. Not earth shattering material but still an interesting discussion.The next nearly 1,000 pages covers Operation Citadel on the southern salient and the subsequent Soviet counter offensive. The time is from early July to mid August when the Soviets recovered all lost ground. The battle history is delivered chronologically in two, three or four day chucks. Its not as precise as daily coverage but it makes for a smoother, easier to follow dialog. The battlefield was broken up by German Corps sector with activity of the 48th PzC leading the narrative, followed by the SS in the center and ending with the 3rd PzC on the right flank. This may sound surprising when discussing a book of such dimensions but while the operational narrative was very interesting, effective and covered equally from both sides, it was not exhaustively complete. There is still material that can be found in other high quality books that could still expand your horizons.Besides the smooth delivery of battle history, Mr Lawrence inserted hundreds of timely, well chosen quotes to supplement his commentary. Though most of the quotes were operational in nature, it made the narrative seem more personal. It will allow the reader to understand that the officers of middle to upper ranks and some enlisted men had a pretty good understanding of the circumstances occurring in their sector. These comments delivered some of the analysis that supplemented the author's commentary as the battle progressed.The air war is also given good coverage in both text and data tables.The next major segment to consider will be Maps. There are many black and white maps spread out throughout the book; they appear to be original war maps. Some German and some Soviet. With a little time the German maps were pretty well deciphered but the Russian language maps were more difficult to study. The author also provided a few fold out maps that were twice the size of the other maps and were easier to read. For me the difficulty in reading some of these maps clearly brought down the effectiveness of this section but this may not be an issue for others. Another issue to consider is that these maps are not fully populated which also brings down their utility a little. Having more unit designations on the maps could clearly help the reader follow the narrative and analysis.The next major category to consider is the vast array of statistical tables. I didn't count them but scattered throughout the book there are probably 200 data tables. Some tables are used as summaries for individual battles while the remaining tables which are housed in the Appendix are generally overall campaign summaries. There is tremendous amount of information here and even if the US Army gathered some of it post war, it must have taken Mr Lawrence a lot of time to gather, organize and resurrect this data into these nifty tables. These tables could clearly be helpful to researchers.The Appendix just mention is roughly 350 pages and contains more than tables. I also enjoyed the sections on commander profiles and even if you're well read on the war, there probably will be some nuggets of interesting information you can learn on your favorite officers. Following these profiles are many portraits of officers on both sides. You get to see the portraits of the names that are so frequently mentioned. Its another way of personalizing this battle.There are other photos to study. There are war time aerial photos of the battle sites as well as present day photos of the terrain; both types were useful in understanding what the Germans had to contend with in reaching the Psel River area as well as seeing how the Soviets were able to stop the advance. Other battlefield photos are included to round out the visual aspect. Some of the photos are grainy.There is also a large Bibliography, Footnotes and a useful Index if further study is desired.I enjoyed this read a great deal and fully appreciate the effort Mr Lawrence has made in writing such a thoughtful book and strongly recommend it to all enthusiasts of the Campaign.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VY59MTAIOF3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0971385254#wasThisHelpful","R3VY59MTAIOF3S","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even if you have read the two creditable books that have recently been published on the Moscow campaign, you should still consider getting this new book translated by Richard Harrison for it has material that the earlier books don't have. The study written by the Soviet General Staff and overseen by Marshall Shaposhnikov primarily covers the three month period of November, December and January 1942; the first months includes insights of Soviet resistance during the German advance while the last month shows much greater details of the Soviets as they initiated their own counter offensive that eventually saw the Germans pushed back to the general line that included Rzhev.The book is highly Soviet centric and nationalistic in nature and is no different than the other Soviet studies that were popularized by David Glantz some years ago. Without condoning the errors included in the original book but also not correcting the miscues, the translation by Mr Harrison is a strict interpertation of the original study but at least he highlights the key but probably not all the exaggerations that have found its way into the study .The book begins with a brief situational summary of the war in October when the Germans launched Operation Typhoon. Its shows the general plan of the Germans and the counter measures that were put in place by Zhukov. Army Group Center had about the same number of men as Western Front but had a clear superority of tanks and artillery that gave von Bock confidence that even with winter approaching his exhausted forces could still take Moscow. The Germans were unaware of the size of the reserves moving up to man the multiple defense lines in front of Moscow when it was decided to extend the advance past November. The Soviets saw the attack as primarily a two prong attack that would envelop Moscow from the north and south. While the central German advance, the more direct Vyazma-Mozhaisk-Moscow route is covered, special attention and analysis is given to the panzer groups attacking toward Kalinin in the north as well as the attack toward Tula in the south.With such a large battlefield to describe and with so many military units deployed among so many towns and cities let alone defending along rivers and canals, reading this battle can sometimes be challenging. Following this story is made a little easier with the inclusion of battle plans before the actual individual battle coverage as well as post analysis.Since this study was meant as a training aid for future battles, the analysis was extensive and battle coverage also included partisan actions, logistic concerns, commissar motivation and air force coordination. The tactical importance of holding certain towns, roads and rivers was especially interesting. Two minor points to mention though not criticism for it was outside of the author's purview. There is not much in-depth discussion of individual officers. The most attention was given to Belov, Zhukov and Stalin plus a handful of other Soviets officers on an even smaller scale. For the Germans Hoth, Guderian, von Bock and Hitler were discussed. FM von Kluge with his promblematical command decisions of late November and early December was glaringly absent. The other aspect that was lacking sufficient attention was the effect the freezing temperatures and deep snow had on the two armies, particularly the German side. Not fully prepared for winter fighting, these conditions had an extreme impact on the men, tanks and other weapons of the German armies.The dozen b&w maps, most are full page, are good and will be helpful. The maps show the key areas of fighting and highlight the text.  An Order of Battle and a useful Index are included.Despite the Soviet bias, I still enjoyed this book, learning some new aspects of the campaign and freely recommend it to all enthusiasts. If you're new to the Moscow campaign Col Seaton's or Mr Zetterling's books on the campaign might be an easier place to begin your study and if you like the campaign definitely get this book to round out your campaign research.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPNKCY5R13SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910294640#wasThisHelpful","RIPNKCY5R13SZ","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book for it covers a lot of important ground and it should appeal to both novice and avid student though , I believe, the more experienced student will get the most out of it. Balck recounts his military experiences starting with WWI right up to May 1945 when he commanded Army Group G on the Western Front. I'll bypass his family introduction and officer candidate experience and jump into WWII on the Eastern Front where I found his higher rank and greater responsibility more interesting though he did distingush himself in France in 1940. Much time is spent as CO of the 11th PzD and later the 48th PzC. Never being far from the front, Balck had intimate knowledge of each battle and as such his descriptions of the battlefield and general tactics used were enlightening and will appeal to the avid student who have probably read about some of the key battles like the Chir River defense, Dnepr River defense, Korsun Pocket, Zhitomir, Tarnopol and more from authors like David Glantz, Douglas Nash, Rolf Hinze, Stephen Barratt and others. The inclusion of Balck's memoirs with the reading of these other authors makes for a more meaningful understanding of the battlefield events. The wisdom and insight of the author, though naturally biased, was still appreciative and helpful.The narrative was much more than just battlefield coverage; the author also covers not only the hardship and misery of fighting on the frontline as well as the morale of the Landster that frequently had to fight under poor conditions. Decisions made at Corps, Army and Group levels as well as the OKH and of course Hitler's impact on the war effort were also discussed. Officers such as Manstein, Model, Guderian, Mellenthin, Manteuffel, Kesselring and Stauffenberg, among many others, were frequently discussed, providing the reader with a profile of each of these men. General Balck had much praise for Manstein, Guderian, Mellenthin, Manteuffel while acknowledging the ability of Model but also saying that many officers and men didn't like him for he micromanage and was aloof. Hitler receives the greatest amount of attention; he was given praise for certain things but for the most part was criticized for his handling of the war and his WWI mentality that caused so much grief and death.In addition to the battlefield history and officer profiles, the author also provides political background during his military career, especially the good and bad points concerning Germany's Allies that adds to the general overall usefullness of the book.The book also includes twenty maps, a useful Appendix which includes Balck's career curriculum and important statements and documents. Photos, extensive Notes and Index are also included.These memoirs and the fine job of editing makes this one of the key books in my library and freely recommend it to all interested parties who want to study the wide ranging and distinguished career of a German General during a critical time of our recent past.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6A7ZTSSTEIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813161266#wasThisHelpful","R1E6A7ZTSSTEIA","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr Nebolsin, using primary and secondary sources, has created a creditable battle history of the highly decorated 2nd Tank Army during 1943 and the first part of 1944. The story is predominately operational in nature. Even most of the first hand accounts are operational though the author gives praise to some individuals for their bravery under fireThe author begins by including the origins and indoctrination of the army and the war status as of early 1943 before quickly moving into the major engagements. The first major engagement involved the northern boundary against Model's 9th Army in Operation Citadel where 2nd TA played a key role in stopping the German advance in the center of the line. The subsequent offensive for the Orel salient is also included. In the last quarter of 1943, the Sevsk offensive is presented. In early 1944, the Korsun Pocket is discussed, followed by the Uman Operation and then the invasion of Romania. The remaining months of the war wil be in Volume 2.With only a couple exceptions, the author uses from one to three pages (excluding tables) to cover each combat day. It doesn't sound like much but with his efficient writing style, the author delivers ample coverage. Included in the coverage are the specific 2nd TA units involved, their deployments and objectives for each engagement. The German division targeted is usually also provided. After engagement results are then listed with special attention given to casualties of man and machine. Many tables are provided for easy study of numbers entering the engagement and the casualties. The author always give specific numbers of T-34s, heavy assault guns and light tanks that were deployed.There was much about the book I enjoyed; I especially liked the fair presentation of the battles including when the Germans took the advantage of certain battlefield sectors that caused horrendous casualties on 2nd TA and its supporting infantry. The effective Luthwaffe was also included. There was no sugar coating or excuses when the army made mistakes, had difficulties or took heavy casualties. I also liked coverage drilling down beyond Corps level to Brigade level in many cases, providing deployments and objective for each unit.There are also 16 full page color maps. The maps have good eye appeal and covers the deployments of 2nd TA but they're not comprehensive, many times lacking full coverage of supporting Soviets units or the German units that were trying to stop them.There is also a large photo gallery that was really good. There were many battlefield shots that included many tank photos in action or moving up to the line. There were quite a few officers and men as well. A decent Bibliography and a helpful Index was also included.I really enjoyed this book though it doesn't have the level of detail that ""Demolishing the Myth"" or ""The Viazma Catastrophe, 1941"" has and yet it provides a good overall picture of the many contributions the 2nd Tank Army made in the last years of the war. Its highly recommended to all fans of the operational but I should also say some readers may be a little disappointed with the scarcity of in-depth truly personal, anecdotal experiences of the war.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAFR5YA7Q2SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909982156#wasThisHelpful","R2FAFR5YA7Q2SX","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a sequel to the author's Operation Typhoon, which covered the German October victories of the pocket battles at Vyazma and Bryansk. This book will take you through the rainy November period to early December where AGC stumbles badly, allowing General Zhukov to halt AGC's advance within sight of the gates of Moscow. (I hear the author's next book will cover Zhukov's counter-attack that pushes AGC back many miles and saves Moscow from capture.)This book like the author's other books is a command level view of the German perspective. While there is mention of divisions attacking key battle sites and the tactical importance of those sites, providing a brief overview of the battlefield, that is not the main purpose of the book. The primary purpose of this book like the series is to show that despite the initial victories of encirclement, Germany didn't have sufficient industry, resources, men, weaponry and vehicles to defeat the Soviet Union. It is also shown that Hitler, the OKH as well as some of the field generals didn't have the proper strategy or the insight to improve it. If you enjoyed the earlier books and are not growing tired of this theme and format no matter how well its presented then you will enjoy this effort as well.While Mr Stahel continues to pound away at the deficiencies of German strategy, poor insight and dubious actions, he adds weight to his perspective by including numerous pertinent, comments and opinions by politicians, soldiers of all ranks and civilians. These numerous comments and diary entries, not only show the extent of his research but also create profiles of key people and strongly assist in showing that by the end of October the Wehrmacht was whipped and to resume its attack toward Moscow was dangerous and unrealistic, even crazy. To believe that after fighting constantly for five months and losing a quarter of your men and even more of your armor to Operation Barbarossa, the exhausted army was expected to surround and clear the huge capital during winter was sheer fantasy. Its like a challenger entering the 10th round of a championship fight against the Red Bear and despite getting in a few good punches during the earlier rounds was standing on wobbly legs while the champ was just getting into stride and ready for another ten rounds if that's what was necessary to win the bout.Though I wish the author would include greater coverage of battlefield events**, I do acknowledge and appreciate the depth of Mr Stahel's research and his insight at this high command level as well as the choice of anecdotal selections to bolster his comments. Topics of discussion include the friction brought about by the discrepancy of strategic views between Hitler and his top commanders, the friction that developed between the field commanders, the independent action that a few generals made that actually had a negative impact, the delusional estimate of the physical status of AGC after the pocket battles in October that generated a hold and defend posture in early November, the poor intelligence gathering, the poor even desperate decision to drive toward Moscow so late in the year with heavy rains followed by extreme cold and snow to contend with. Overlooking the desperate need for vehicle maintenance, rest for the men and buildup of supplies must also be considered on how it would impact the resumption of the offensive on the fortified capital must also be factored into the equation. The lack of planning if Moscow was encircled or was entered. There is also the aspect that despite the fact that Soviet defenses were now slowing the German advance, Hitler, Hader and the OKH deluded themselves into thinking the Soviets were finished and sound tactics were unnecessary. And with AGC not having a plan in case the Soviet Union actually did counter-attack made them even more vulnerable. With all this in mind the overriding central theme of Mr Stahel's position is: Did Germany have the potential ability and resources to defeat the Soviet Union in a longer than expected war of attrition. The author once again believes the cost of German victories throughout 1941 was too high coupled with insufficient armor, planes, men and industrial support at home would doom the Germany's chances for victory. The author takes on each of these topics and more and convincingly proves his position.(**There are already good books that have such battlefield coverage and if interested should be read along with this book. Three books quickly come to mind; the authors are Albert Seaton, Zetterling and Frankson, and Radey and Sharp.)There are 18 b+w, large scale maps which will be helpful; there is also an extensive Notes Section, Bibliography and Index if further research is desired.The author, as usual, does a nice job of tying these latest circumstances into his overall position that the Germans didn't have enough resources or a proper coherent strategy to defeat the Soviets and in fact argues the war was lost by the end of 1941. The author paints a vivid picture of the conditions and hardships facing the German troops and the impossible task the OKH was ordering. I personally believe the author has taken this theorem as far as necessary and has proven his point and I hope will now concentrate more on the battlefield historiography, tactics and anecdotal experiences with his future books. I've been very impressed with this book and series and fully recommend all Mr Stahel's books to all interested students.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNGRPY50GTKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107087600#wasThisHelpful","R1KNGRPY50GTKN","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the six new ""Bulge"" books that have been released in the last two months, this book at least from my perspective of favoring battlefield operations and analysis is most impressive. In addition to this inspiring story is an equalily impressive map set and a large photo gallery. With the book having dimensions of nearly 9 in. by 12 in., most of the maps are large and the many photos will not overpower the story.The book opens with three introductory chapters that covers the prehistory of the sector, the planning of the German offensive and then the preparations for the attack. The next three chapters takes up the offensive for at least the first week of the campaign. The time period varies, being longer in some sectors. The battle actions begins with 5th PzA sector against the 28th ID defenders, followed by the 7th Army attacking 4th ID and finally the 6th SS PzA as tail end Charlie attacking in the north against 99th ID. The next two chapters covers the air war followed by the siege of Bastogne and collectively these five chapters consume the bulk of the offensive. The last three chapters covers the action starting with the new year and you'll read about the Operation Northwind to the south of 1st Army, the beginning of the Allied counter offensive that will eventually push the German forces out of the Ardennes. Coverage ends at the end of January.Mr Bergstrom has a military bearing and I enjoyed his dialog as he describes the military events. He sets up the combat engagements very well, using a no nonsense approach in describing the combatants facing each other, mission parameters, the deployments being used, axes of attack and flanking positions if any. Terrain and weather conditions are also often included in the mix. The avid student of the operational will really appreciate this writing style. The combat coverage frequently drives down to company level or combat group level and when the skirmish is larger, battalion and regiment level is usually provided.Military profiles of key officers and men of both sides are included and provide additional insight into the decisions made on the battlefield. Interesting sidebars are also provided throughout the book that are related to the battlefield action but not directly a part of the battle action.To enhance his narrative, many snippets of after action reports are included as well as quotes from key people in the campaign. Also at the end of each chapter, a helpful summary of conclusions and results are mentioned. This end summary will help clarify any concerns you might have while reading the chapter. Coverage is fairly even between the two combatants, neither side being permanently overshadowed.In addition to an expert narrative, the author has included twenty excellent B+W maps. These maps are visually appealing and well populated and the reader will be able to gleam a lot from them. These maps have been wisely chosen in with regards to sector and time. These maps could be used as reference when reading any book on the ""Bulge"". The large photo gallery which, includes helpful captions, is also an asset to the book. The book also contains a nice set of color plates of tanks and planes that were involved in the campaign. The expert Notes Section, Bibliography, Appendix can also be of good value if further research is desired. The author has used a wide range of primary and secondary sources and the results of his efforts are clearly evident.The narrative ends with Conclusions. This chapter is also creditworthy (for the most part) as the author who is clearly sympathetic to the German cause, gives final appraisal and summary to the campaign. I was perplexed with part of the opening paragraphs when Mr Bergstrom discusses the positive aspects of the German battle plan and its subsequent execution of it. I fully agree that the German plan and preparation of said plan was generally very good, especially considering the lateness in the war, having been pushed back from Normandy and the shortages of fuel and other materials as well as the lack of training to many of the German soldiers. However the battle plan, at least from my perspective, was not as perfect as the author states in this opening but luckily as the chapter evolves, the author clarifies many of those points of contention, at least with regards to the 6th SS PzA. The comments by the author regarding the questionable execution of the SS Army plan clarified much of my concern for the author's comments but I would also submit the fact that with Hitler giving Dietrich, an officer of questionable command experience, the most powerful army of the three and gave him the worse terrain for armor as a major flaw in the plan. When several divisions were late arriving to their launch point and with the problems with the Heydte airdrop, I submit a major alteration to the original battle plan, especially concerning Elsenborn Ridge, should have been exercised but wasn't. There are a number of other tactical concerns that could be debated but, overall, looking at the overview and summary of results as a whole the chapter is noteworthy. The brief dissussion on small solution vs big solution was interesting, especially the part regarding the serious circumstances the Allies would have found themselves in if the warehouse system in and around Liege had been captured by the Germans.""Ardennes 1944-1945"" is an awesome effort by Mr Bergstrom and it deserves all the praise that I'm sure it will get. For me it's a must have reference for my library and would suggest to all avid students of the campaign that it be added to their's as well. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQUS5C75N8II/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612002773#wasThisHelpful","RVQUS5C75N8II","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to compare ""Thunder at Prokhorovka"" with two leading books. I wanted to see how it would fare against the best. I chose David Glantz's ""The Battle of Kursk"" and Mark Healy's ""Zitadelle"". All three books are operational in nature and should prove a good match. I'm making this comparison not because I enjoy being humbled but because it should help me write a better book in the future.Mr Healy has spent a little more than half the book on the preparation and introduction to the campaign. It starts with the relationship of Hitler and Manstein at the time of the Kharkov Offensive and then expands on the discussion with Zeitzler, Manstein and other generals in deciding on which form of the Kursk Offensive: the ""Fronthand"" or the less aggressive ""Backhand Approach"". Once decided, Mr Healy enumerates every situation or condition that will have an effect on the offensive. Its an extensive analysis that is impressive. It includes Stalin's spy ring, Churchill's notification of the offensive to Stalin, Hitler's delays, planning the offensive, Luftwaffe support, panzer production troubles, partisan interaction, Lend Lease assistance to Stalin and much more. I particularly liked the discussion on Hitler's views on Manstein. It was also significant how many of the generals disavowed the ""Backhand"" approach.Glantz and Schranck also discuss such items but not in as much length or detail. This area goes to Healy.The next area to compare would be Wonder Weapons and tanks in general. Mr Glantz discusses Hitler's new panzers in chapter one and in chapter two a little about Russian armor. The Tigers, Panthers and Elefants are furthered discussed throughout the book. Mr Healy devotes an entire section of 7 chapters - Part Three- to the subject of wonder weapons and tank tactics. ""Thunder"" also has good coverage of these weapons but the material is interspersed throughout the book and may be less conveinent to study than the other two books.The presentation is impressive for Mr Healy and he wins here.Mr Healy spends 170 pages on the offensive while David Glantz spends 176 pages and Schranck spends 432 pages on the offensive. The volume is about the same for the first  two authors while ""Thunder at Prokhorovka"" spends over twice as much time on the battlefield. Glantz lists more engagements than Healy who is more selective but gives greater depth to each selection. Schranck provides greater breadth of the fighting and extends the coverage to the end of August in regards to the Orel salient. Mr Glantz provides good coverage of the tank battles near Prokhorovka but Thunder provides even fuller coverage and it has better analysis of the Soviet armored assault.  I'll give this section to Schranck.I have an interest for July 8th and 9th for its a pivotal period in the campaign. The moves and counter moves made will lead to the tank battles near Prokhorovka just a few days later. The first two authors cover the days well but Mr Healy writes an auxiliary chapter, Chapter 37, that discusses the Soviet contention that it was their blocking actions of these attacks south of Oboyan caused the Germans to shift to the east toward Prokhorovka which resulted in the massive tank battles. He presents evidence to the contrary, that it was in the German battle plan back in May to shift to the northeast. Very interesting chapter. In a related matter, Mr Healy refutes Soviet claims of destroying thousands of panzers in the first few days. This theory is confirmed on July 13th when Manstein, believing he still has ample armor, argues with Hitler to continue the battle in the south. Both Mansttein and Kempf were confident that by continuing the assault, Soviet tank reserves could be shattered. The other two authors also provide coverage on this topic. ""Thunder"" is the only book that has a battle map of the Soviet armored counter-attacks.Near the end of Chapter 4, Mr Glantz states in his book that due to the stalled advance of Kempf and the stiff resistance facing 48th PzC driving north toward Oboyan that Hoth orders the 2nd SS PzC to shift its axis toward Prokhorovka. This would be more in tune with Soviet doctrine and a difference with Mr Healy. Schranck also provides good coverage on this important issue, exploring both sides but in the end shows Hoth had intended to move toward Prokhorovka before the campaign started.Another point of related interest is the number of tanks destroyed in the campaign. Each author have similar comments and quote similar numbers for this topic. An important point is that the Germans were able to recover many damaged tanks for use in future battle. About 325 panzers were destroyed while another 1600 damaged panzers were recovered for future use. Its estimated that the Russians lost 1614 tanks, five times the number of German losses. This topic is a draw.In one area where the authors might have improved their coverage concerns the battle for the skies. This is not unusual for Mr Glantz but he does mentions in Chapter 3 the condition of the Luftwaffe in the sector before the start of the battle. Mr Healy does discuss a little fuller on the air war in Chapter 16. The air war coverage in ""Thunder"" is delivered on a daily basis and is similar in scale to the other two. This catagory is a tie.Each author ends his book with Conclusions. The main theme to the earlier books is the future implications to the lessening of German offensive capabilities. Both are good but Glantz is more extensive in this specific area and he takes this sub catagory. Schranck spends less time of the future potentials for the combatants and spends much more time discussing and analyzing the good and bad decisions made during the campaign. Special attention is presented on the errors made by General Hoth, the improper deployment of 3rd PzC and the armored charge of General Rotmistrov. The battleplan for Rotmistrov was ill conceived and a alternate plan is suggested that would undoubtedly have harvested better results. Its close but Schranck takes this catagory.Both of the leading books have photos but ""Zitadelle"" has many more and better ones and in this area it clearly wins.Each book have maps. ""Battle of Kursk"" have functional ones, timely interspersed throughout the narrative and are relatively easy to study as your reading. Mr Healy only has a few maps at the beginning of the book. He does have a map of the July 12th tank battle which was helpful. ""Thunder at Prokhorovka"" have more maps and they are in color. They are fully populated and are easier to study. There are also six large color pull-out maps that can be used alongside your book as you read. Schranck takes this catagory.All three books have an Appendix. They're similar in nature but ""Battle of Kursk"" is more extensive and Glantz wins here.The last category to be compared is the readability of the book. I'll give the winner first then an explanation. Both Glantz and Healy are experienced writers and both do a good job of writing their book but I would have to give Healy the win here for he provides better balance between operational history and writing an interesting story. While I like Glantz's writing style, his exhaustive descriptions of deployments and axes of attack can be overwhelming.The writing style for ""Thunder"", the author's first book, shows signs of author inexperience, having moments of awkwardness and redundancy but these circumstances goes beyond experience. Both circumstances are due in part to the fact that ""Thunder"" started its existence as a database that after ten years of work evolved into a massive structure. It had to be culled to contain relevant data and then converted into a book format. I spent a lot of time on the conversion but looking back didn't spend nearly enough time converting this massive amount of material.This is my simple, amateur ratings contest. People, of course, will weigh things differently. Owning any one of these books will make you a winner, but the best choice is to have all three books in your library. Not any one book has complete coverage and they really do complement each other to provide a more rounded experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HSGXN7JRG5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909384542#wasThisHelpful","R37HSGXN7JRG5F","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can easily see the diligent research and years of hard work and study that has gone into this book. Congratulations to Mr Caddick-Adams for a book that will probably be discussed alongside books by MacDonald, Cole and Parker.With over 900 pages the book is deliberate, never hurrying to move on to the next topic. (Readers should be prepared for this deliberateness.) To conceptualize, the book is broken down into four parts. The first part begins with prehistory which consumes 260 pages. It not only covers the war situation like Operation Market-Garden and the Hurtgen Forest of the prior few months before the offensive but also briefly mentions Normandy, North Africa and Italy in an ancillary way. The importance of secrecy for the Germans in their preparations, the dislike of the offensive by many German commanders, the lack of trained grenadiers, transport trucks and fuel are just a few examples explained in this introduction. On the American side the risk of manning a thin defense along the German border and the intelligence failure are just two examples. The problems that arose for the Allies by not understanding Hitler's psyche is also included. The importance of weather, terrain, logistics and the physical conditions of both sides are also included. This is just a capsule summary; expect much more to this first section. The second and third parts houses the actual battle events of the offensive as well as the profiles of key officers and men that are expanded from the introduction. This section has 400 pages. The battle coverage is driven from the American perspective though there is plenty of German material. Battle coverage is ample for most readers but its not exhaustive; there are several books on the market that have greater coverage but overall the combined coverage of the operational and ancillary details makes this book an awesome competitor. The fourth part entails the post campaign thoughts of the author and uses about 60 pages. The rest of the book includes the Notes Section, Bibliography, Index and Appendix. From my perspective I enjoyed the first and last parts of the book the best for it added dimension to the middle of the book. The Notes Section, Bibliography and Glossary are exemplary. The abbreviated Order of Battle is also helpful as is the Officer Rank table if needed. There are also a number of good large scale, gray maps and a worthy photo gallery to study.Part 2 begins the initial German attack along the entire line. Coverage starts in the south in 4th ID sector, moves north to the 28th ID sector then further north to the 106th ID sector. The 99th ID defending Elsenborn and the twin villages are then covered. Returning to the southern sector, Patton and his two corps driving north and a well rounded Bastogne story is revealed. On the German side, there is more relative material covered for 7th Army and especially 5th PzA than 6th SS PzA. I felt General Dietrich's Army could have been more fully covered.  The affairs concerning Peiper, Heydte, Skorzeny are also included. I could give a day by day summary but I'll stop here as the end of the week is reached. Suffice it to say, the battlefield coverage is very good though not exhaustive and includes many first hand and ancillary accounts.I was impressed with this battle coverage; it was an overall excellent effort by Mr Caddick-Adams. The author has married operational, personal and ancillary material into an informed story that has both breadth and depth and will give the reader a good overall understanding of this pivotal battle. It is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3848GP2TWDG5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199335141#wasThisHelpful","R3848GP2TWDG5C","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its been a popular myth since the end of the war that the Smolensk campaign had been small, unimportant and had little influence on the German defeat at Moscow a few months later. It was also at this time that Hitler had generated huge consternation with his leading Commanders over the decision of delaying the attack on Moscow for the potential encirclement at Kiev. Mr Glantz categorically refutes this myth, seeing this period as extremely important. He has gone to great lengths to write extensively in his first two volumes to defend his contrarian position. To give even greater credence to his position, this third volume was released. Though the first two volumes had their own Appendix, this new volume ""guilds the lily"" by adding a magnitude more reference material. There are small threads of material relating to the Germans throughout the book but overwhelmingly the book is Soviet centric. In addition to the 25 appendices that cover both first volumes, there are 16 new maps and a few new tables to study as well. The maps are typical Glantz: not bad but  some are not easily viewed or studied.This Grand Appendix that consumes the entire book has a mixed character, covering different aspects of the battle action. There are Orders of Battle and Composition reports. There are also many battle orders and Stavka directives that are explained and commented on. These orders describe defensive postures like the defense of the Smolensk Pocket as well as the several main counter offensives that began on July 23rd and August 6th or Zhukov's offensive to eliminate the Elnia Pocket. The author also includes a useful Table of Contents and a special Index to make it easier for readers to find specific information. The Appendix is laid out chronologically, following the formatting of the first two volumes and if you have read those volumes then you won't have trouble navigating this book.I normally jump at buying a new Glantz book but not this time. I was happy with and understood the first two books and wasn't planning on buying this book. The thought of wading through another six hundred pages was overwhelming but I slowly convinced myself that if new book could improve my understanding of the campaign by ten percent, it would be worth it.This book should appeal to dedicated campaign enthusiasts or researchers and in that venue the book is worth its weight in gold. Despite my enthusiasm for the Eastern Front, my main focus will remain on the first two volumes and will use the third volume as a resource when the other volumes need a boost. I'm glad I changed my mind for this book is a worthy addition but potential buyers should consider the scale, degree of difficulty and subjective nature of the book before purchasing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7GY88XVIWHH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909982113#wasThisHelpful","R7GY88XVIWHH4","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This highly researched sequel that uses many primary sources was eagerly anticipated. Having read ""No Silent Night"", I expected this new book to be good. And it was.This narrowly focused story concentrates primarily on only two divisions. The exhausted US 4th Armored Division under Maj General Gaffey which drives north from Arlon to relieve Bastogne while the reconstituted German 5th Fallschirmjager Division under the control of Col Heilmann tries to stop the American armor from reaching Bastogne. There are other units mentioned like Col Kokott's 26th VGD which supported the 5th FJD south of Bastogne but these occurrences are brief.The narrative covers the key battles these divisions were ensnarled in and include the battles for control of the couple key roads to Bastogne (from the south) and the following villages: Chaumont, Warnach, Bigonville, Tintange and finally Assenois. The author clearly shows the hardships each division endured to keep or to gain control of this sector. The fighting was tenacious and vicious amid the freezing temperatures, icy roads and difficult terrain and Mr Barron does a good job of conveying that hardship. Before the primary fighting begins, a brief introduction that includes the 5th FJD moving into blocking position sets the stage. The involvement of General Patton and his corps along with profiles of key officers of both sides are also developed.I particularly enjoyed this book for the author slowly and deliberately evolves this story so the reader can really appreciate the historical development regardless of experience. Along the way many personal accounts from both sides are covered, enhancing the tactical. There is a lot of day to day actions, protocols and coverage that most readers will enjoy and the author spends equal time discussing the 4th AD and the 5th FJD.In addition to the narrative, a few good maps are included but personally a few more maps would have been nice. A small photo gallery is also included. An excellent Bibliography and Notes section are also provided if further research is desired as is an Index. An abbreviated Order of Battle is included. The last chapter. ""Epilogue"", though not large was  a summary and a nice finishing touch to the story.Mr Barron's diligent research, clever dialog and military experience clearly shines through in this story and even if you have already read the story of Bastogne its still highly recommended to all interested parties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGKVEIM2C8AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467876#wasThisHelpful","R2NGKVEIM2C8AT","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author begins his book by stating the premise for writing it. Mr Ludewig believes the campaign in Normandy like in the Ardennes and along the West Wall later in the year has been documented satisfactorily while the events in August and September could be further studied and documented. He also states while there is some coverage of the Allies, the primary focus of this book will be from the German perspective. With these stated parameters, I thought the book was a five star effort. If you're looking for prominent attention on the Allied side or unabridge coverage of the entire last half of 1944 you may be disappointed.If your main concern is the Allied position you would be better off reading books by Carlo D'Este, Adam Smith, John Prados, Ken Ford, Martin Blumenson for their coverage is more comprehensive in this area. However if you have already read those books and are looking for more on the German side then ""Ruckzug"" is clearly the book you want.The book begins by summing up the political and military situation leading up to the Overlord and Dragoon invasions from both sides. The lack of organization and coordination between OB West, its commanders and Berlin is clearly covered. The disruptive influence of Hitler is shown numerous times. His insistence on the offensive and refusal to consider a pullback when it was necessary are well documented. In addition Kluge, Model, Rundstedt, Blaskowitz, Zangen and others are frequently discussed as well. As the story is told you will see that the German field commanders foresaw much of the Allied tactics but due to a lack of men, weapons and fuel or the baring of the use of panzers or of the other restrictions placed on them by Hitler or finally the overwhelming superiority of the Allied Air Force, were unable to respond appropriately or sufficiently in many circumstances.On the Allied position, important information is covered but just not to the same depth or breadth as the German perspective. The importance of a successful Dragoon Operation and how it could influence the Overlord operation is emphasized as well as the eventual pullback by Army Group G. The securing of several ports along Brittany and the Med is also highlighted. The Allied disaster of not quickly gaining control of the Scheldt and utilizing Antwerp is also given attention. The Falaise Gap is only lightly covered but the author does admit the Allied Commander's lax attention to it cost them a golden opportunity to shorten the war. Errors made by both sides are highlighted. Coverage of Allied Commanders is modest.In addition to Army Group G coverage the 15th Army north of the Seine in the early days of Normandy as well as the affect of the Allies crossing the Seine in August is also covered well as is the recovery of the rest of Army Group B after crossing the Seine.Though this is a summary, there are many details like divisions involved, defensive positions, casualties of men and panzers and through it all the author provides reasons and analysis why and how events happened. I would hazard to say that even experienced students may learn some new things on the German position.The final chapter, the Conclusion ties everything together. Though the Allies had been kept in check for much of June and July, by August the German Armies were on a precipice and were in danger of imploding but with the pullback north of the Seine to the West Wall and with the shortening of the line, the Germans got it together and for the rest of the year would give the Allies a difficult time.There are also 25 informative general purpose maps that will help your understanding of the coverage. A few pointers are provided throughout the book to direct you to study the proper map that relates with the narrative. There is also a small but excellent photo gallery of key German officers; most photos I've haven't seen before.Besides a noteworthy story, the author provides an extensive 90 page Notes Section and an impressive Bibliography of mostly primary sources but also a few secondary sources as well. If you're looking for further research, these two sections will be of great help. An Index closes the book.It seems apparent that Mr Ludewig has studied this sector and time period extensively and delivers an overall noteworthy presentation and analysis, especially from the German side and if that's where your interest lies then you should consider this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JBYDZM2BL2BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081314079X#wasThisHelpful","R2JBYDZM2BL2BB","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new book by Mr Barratt is a comprehensive look at an important but tragically neglected Soviet campaign that will lead to the expulsion of AGS from western Ukraine.This first volume covers operations from 12/24/1943 to 1/9/1944 where the 1st Ukrainian Front launches an attack from their Kiev bridgehead against the 4th PzA. The second volume will cover the desperate German counter-attack and the eventual halting of that attack that takes you to the end of January but the heaviest fighting occurs in this volume and the counter-attack the Germans attempt will not gain them much. While this volume contains a number of useful statistical tables, the author promises to add an Appendix of additional information in Volume 2. Brief Foot Notes and an Index are provided as are a few photos of key officers.Though as thoroughly as enjoyable and impressive as this battle reconstruction was, I have to admit it was also a demanding read if you try to seriously follow and understand every lunge, parry and counterattack this book has to offer for the author, using primary records, provides extensive details of the many individual engagements, the units and officers involved in those battles and the towns, villages, rivers and roads fought over during this nearly three week period.The author, who is a historian specializing on the German Army during WWII, naturally drives the story from the German side but also includes a wealth of information on General Vatutin's 1st Ukrainian Front as the Soviets take on the 4th PzA under the new leadership of General Raus with eventual support from General Hube and 1st PzA.The introduction and the first two chapters presents the immediate prehistory of the war that leads to the ending conditions and disposition of the two sides as Stalin initiates this first of several winter offensives to drive the Germans out of Ukraine. The expansion of the Kiev bridgehead prior to this campaign as well as how this campaign evolves into the Korsun pocket are highlights of this intro. The fighting will cover from Korosten in the north to Vinnitsa in the south where the line then shifts eastward to the Dnepr River. The heaviest fighting of the campaign will take place between Zhitomir to just south of Berdichev. In the first two chapters you'll read about all the divisions Vatutin has and where they are deployed for maximum effect; you will also read about the plans Vatutin and his staff have developed to defeat the enemy. On the German side an order of battle is also provided as well as their deployments and their physical status and shortcomings at this late stage in the war. The remaining eight chapters provide a daily chronicle of the actual fighting along this line for this nearly three week period. I thought this coverage and analysis was excellent and is clearly the best rendition I've read of this campaign. The author has definitely spent a lot of time on this book.In addition to this comprehensive battle coverage and analysis, the author also provides 142 full page maps to help the reader follow the battle. The author and publisher have made an extreme effort to make these maps clearly readable and as useful as possible and usually include corps and division deployments for the German side though the Soviet side is represented by red arrows of attack with no specific deployment info provided for the Red Army. With so many maps it would be a herculean job in providing this info but it would have been really great having it. Each day's activity has anywhere from three to eight maps broken down by corps sector and the separate map book has a really useful Map List that will enable the reader to find the map(s) needed within seconds.Though the operation covered is not on the same scale as Stalingrad or Kursk or even Smolensk 41, the author has still delivered an authoritative presentation that's comparable in style to the works by David Glantz, George Nipe, Steven Newton, David Stahel. If you like those authors, the odds are high you'll like this new book. I humbly submit Mr Baratt's book has added a small but important segment of historiography post Kursk that shows the Germans' continued lost of ground and is highly recommended for serious students of operational history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10QBBH5J9GBCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907677666#wasThisHelpful","R10QBBH5J9GBCZ","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book like the author's earlier works focuses on the strategic and tactical aspects of battle and in the Preface Mr Taylor explains his interest and coverage of the book. He acknowledges the dramatic human interest aspect associated with this period but explains it will fall outside his purview.This book begins with a brief history of Konigsberg then moves into a summary of some of the significant military and political events of the war that leads up to Operation Bagration and the entry into Poland. When the story truly begins on the Soviet invasion of Prussia, the reader will have a good understanding of the history and status of the two enemies and the importance of controlling East Prussia.Chapter 3 begins the six month Soviet invasion of East Prussia ending in the fall of the country and capitulation of the Konigsberg.The Germans were greatly outnumbered but yet put up determined resistance that made Chernyakhovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front stumble a number of times. The battle for Courtland to the northeast with the Baltic Front is also touched on as well. Mr Taylor gives Chernyakhovsky high praise but the Soviet general, though deserving praise, underestimated the Germans and made several tactical errors early in the campaign, delaying victory. Other key figures in the story were Lasch, Hossbach, Reinhardt, Raus, Koch, Zhukov, Vasilevsky, Rokossovsky, Bagramyan and of course Hitler and Stalin.The presentation is almost equally distributed between the two adversaries with perhaps a slight plurality for the Germans. Its also concise and to the point and if you have any interest in the nearly daily tactical events of this battle, this book will not bore you. It also touches on the political circumstances that includes the influences of Stalin and Hitler but again coverage is not elaborate. There is some coverage of human suffering but its on a tertiary level.While the civilian and human interest aspects are minor, Mr Taylor covers the strategic side why Prussia needed to be captured before Zhukov could securely advance on Berlin. Casualties and the impact of the campaign on certain key people and the overall war effort are also discussed in the last chapter.In addition to the narrative, a selection of black and white maps are scattered throughout the book that will assist the reader in his understanding of the campaign. The maps are good but some of the tactical maps could've had greater details in troop dispositions. A small but good selection of photos complete the main section of the book. They include key officers as well as weapons and battlefield scenes. A Bibliography and Index complete the book.Mr Taylor has done a nice job of describing the military events of the campaign and as such his book is recommended to all interested in military history. If further reading is desired, I would also recommend reading Prit Buttar's ""Battleground Prussia"" which has a wider scope of coverage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32DP1MA11MPJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477676295#wasThisHelpful","R32DP1MA11MPJJ","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recognize the limitations of chronologies but also can see their virtues as well. This book like the other books in the ""Day by Day"" series covers a lot of ground and its easy to follow; it provides width of subject but not a lot of depth. Though chronologies can be abrupt, changing subjects frequently, this book is a little different than the other books in the series for it has more narrative and less chronological entries. Its more readable and for people who don't usually like chronologies but are interested in the battle for Stalingrad may like this book for the narrative portion is dominant.The large introduction provides background info of prewar history of the two armies and their dictators. It then moves into coverage of the first year of the war from Barbarossa to the defeat of Timoshenko and the capture of Kharkov. Page 55 of this nearly 200 age book begins with Operation Blue and the advance toward Voronezh and the Don River, followed by the reaching and bitter fighting for Stalingrad. Operation Uranus, the pocketing of 6th Army, Manstein's relief attempt and finally the surrender of Paulus are then covered. Also included are brief glimpses into the fighting for the Crimea and Sevastopol in particular, Rostov and the Caucasus. The book closes with analysis of the impact this campaign will have on the rest of the war. The author calls it the turning point in the war.The incorporation of the narrative, chronological entries, the dozen color maps and other sidebars on weapons used and men who led, many fine photos was overall interesting and informative and new and casual readers should come away with a good understanding of the basic events, weapons involved and key people of this ferocious campaign. This book can't compare with the heavily detailed historiography or tactical maps developed by David Glantz or Jason Mark but as an avid collector of Stalingrad material, I also recommend it to fellow enthusiasts and collectors for you might find a new photo or pick up some new bit of info to add to your knowledge base.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JYZEQRMU3JLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785828923#wasThisHelpful","R1JYZEQRMU3JLS","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the introduction, a capsule summary of the key events of the war before the Battle of Kursk is given and includes Barbarossa, Stalingrad, the Soviet offensive after Stalingrad in AGS sector and the retaking of Kharkov by Manstein in Feb, Mar 1943. Still in summary but with a greater level of detail, the author describes Kursk. At this juncture, Mr Nipe goes to great length to discuss the tank battles near Prokhorovka as well as the false propaganda and exaggerations of German losses that have surfaced over the years about that fateful July 12th. The author provides statistics of the losses of that fateful day but as he concludes this Kursk summary, he simply states that even if you didn't have the correct casualty figures, all you would need to know that the Soviet numbers quoted were exaggerated was a knowledge of the level of resistance and destruction the 2nd SS PzC (minus LAH) levied on the 1st Tank Army, the 5th GTA and others at the Mius River and at the Merla / Merchik Rivers. Once you read this book you will understand the capability the German panzer corps still had during the last half of July and all of August.In mid July, after the Allies landed on Sicily and Citadel was becoming too costly, Hitler calls off his offensive. This is when the author leaves summary mode and begins a detailed study and analysis of the next six weeks of battle when the Soviets launched their own offensives to the south of the Kursk salient. The battle action begins in mid July in the Mius River area when Tolbukhin's Southern Front launches a diversionary attack against 6th Army to draw German forces away from the Kursk salient. The subsequent German counterattack to regain lost ground of the newly formed Soviet bridgehead was especially revealing and costly. At the beginning of August a major Soviet offensive begins north of the Merla-Merchik Rivers area, west of Belgorod and Kharkov and will last to the end of August. In both campaigns, the 2nd SS PzC was used to try to stop the assault. In the later assault, these mobile forces would be up against the Soviet 6th Guard Army, and the reformed 1st Tank Army and the 5th Guard Tank Army.The daily coverage of the tactical engagements, which is from the German perspective, is excellent. For the German side the level of detail is usually at the division level while the Soviets are presented at either Army, Corps or Division level. Sometimes Mr Nipe doesn't provide Soviet designation on every occurrence of an engagement and will force the reader to remember the previous entry of said engagement. This is not bad for the previous entry is usually quite close and not hard to find if a refresher is needed. The accompanying analysis is also very good and will appeal to many of the readers.To greatly add to the story, there were 29 maps. The maps were simple but effective and were spread out conveniently throughout the book and were aligned with the narrative, making it easier to follow the action along the key rivers, valleys, fortified hills and villages. In addition to the useful maps, an extensive gallery of 75 photos of German officers, equipment and battle scenes was provided.Without many first hand experiences, some may think this book dry but for those interested in the operational aspects of this time and sector along with insightful appraisal, this book will be highly valued for its high level of detail, analysis and truthfulness.The author includes an Appendix which has an abbreviated Order of Battle as well as other statistics. The OB could've been more complete but it was still useful. The author delivers analysis throughout the book but his final chapter of conclusions and observations is especially helpful. The author makes the case that Manstein was right to want to keep 4th PzA and III PzC together to complete and destroy the huge pocket south of Prokhorovka. It would have given 6th Army a better chance of holding the Mius bridgehead in August.There is also a Notes section, a Bibliography but no Index. Though using some secondary sources and interviews, much of the material came from primary sources like the National Archives in Washington DC.For those who are trying to piece together the operational events of the war, this book is invaluable for its detail of the last half of July and August 1943 is most comprehensive and fills in an important piece of the puzzle that other books miss. Its highly recommended for serious students as is his other books, ""The Last Victory in Russia"" and ""Blood Steel and Myth"". Collectively these three books provide the serious student an excellent picture of this important time period (Feb-Aug 1943) and sector though it will have a German bias.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4CS53MRYEJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811711625#wasThisHelpful","RA4CS53MRYEJT","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr Nevenkin has chosen to cover only a partial history of the Soviet's advance through Hungary in the autumn of 1944. The coverage entails the brief period when Malinovsky's forces make their first attempt to capture Budapest from the east and southeast. The Marshall's attempt to take Budapest and establish a secure bridgehead over the Danube failed but its an interesting story and the author does a good job of covering it and the ramifications caused by that failure.The story begins with an informative five chapter introduction that succinctly describes the political situation for eastern and southern Europe that includes the rationale and motivations of the key players: Stalin, Churchill, Hitler, FDR, Tito, Timoshenko and Horthy. The introduction clearly explains Stalin's desire to quickly capture Hungary in order to reach Austria before the Western Allies and other strategic considerations of the region that would impact Allied relations for the rest of the war. The author's extensive research is clearly shown, supplying info based on primary documents and officer's diaries to support his comments and analysis of the operational events.The battle summary, which is Soviet driven covers the two week period ending in early November, is concise and easy to follow. A good chronology of villages captured and rivers crossed allows the reader to see the Soviet advance as well as the areas where the German resistance stymied the Soviets. The many B&W maps will aid in that understanding though it wasn't always easy to find the correct map to support your reading. It would have been nice if pointers were used in the narrative to direct the reader to the proper map. While the overall assessment of the maps is good, some of the tactical maps could have had greater detail, showing more exacting unit locations as well as more units that participated in the assault. The axes of attack for the Russians as well as the German defenses weren't always shown either.In additions to the many maps, many good photos of the key officers and interesting battlefield pics were provided.The author also provides an impressive 70 page Appendix that includes OBs, panzer numbers, casualties, war crimes committed, supporting Air War numbers and a whole lot more. People who enjoy statistics will like these tables.If further research is desired, the excellent Notes section and extensive Bibliography will help. The Index is good but its not complete for I found several events missing from it.The story of the fighting in the deep south and especially west of Budapest is also intriguing both militarily and politically and I hope the author will continue this hard fought saga with follow-up volumes.Despite having examples of awkward grammar or incomplete sentence structure, this is a creditable narrative of the first phase of the Soviet offensive to capture the capital of Hungary and is recommended to all who have an interest in the country's history or the time period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4S7376IQLKPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752466313#wasThisHelpful","R4S7376IQLKPX","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This operational summary is excellent and if you have an interest in this important but neglected siege or you have read the author's other books and like his style then you'll enjoy this book as well. This proficient presentation delivers a helpful introduction, providing background information and a situational report that allows the reader have a good understanding on how this pocket which lies between the two key cities of Staraya Russa and Rzhev was formed. The 57 page campaign will then describe how the Germans defended it against daily attacks from all sides by the Northwestern Front for 13 months. The Germans were outmanned 4 to 1; at nearby Kholm, the ratio was even higher.This Osprey Campaign is laid out in the traditional format having Opposing Commanders, Opposing Plans, Opposing Forces as well as a decent two page Chronology that precedes the actual campaign. These chapters were all good, not finding any serious holes in the coverage. I especially enjoyed Opposing Plans. The Germans were just trying to defend their current positions, trying to stay in touch with AGC and not to lose any important logistic lines. The Soviet plans were more involved, more ambitious, trying to not only destroy the two army corps of 16th Army defending the Staraya-Demyansk-Kholm sector but also inflict casualties on 18th Army to the north. The plan also included potentially having Northwestern Front participate in the reduction of Rzhev Salient or even driving all the way to the Baltic Sea if certain events succeeded. Opposes Forces includes a helpful Order of Battle.The campaign was very informative, having all the corps and armies that were involved as well as the key battle sites and events including the airlift in spring 1942. The accompanying analysis was also good. In the final pages of the campaign plus ""Aftermath"", the author sums up the results and costs of this siege.There were also nine maps: six 2D and three 3D maps. All came with comments to allow the reader to follow the action better. I particularly liked the progression of the 2D maps that showed you the sector front line in 1941, the closing of the Demyansk pocket, the relief corridor being formed and the continued assault of both by the Northwestern Front throughout 1942. The three two-page action scenes by Peter Dennis were also good.In addition to the maps was an excellent photo gallery that clearly showed the rugged terrain, the deep snow and the defenses that saved the two army corps from destruction. These photos like the maps clearly contributed to the overall satisfaction of this book.This successful defense of this important sector was critical not only for the wellbeing of AGN but also for the entire front line and the continuation of the war. If Northwestern Front was able to penetrate this sector in a major way, Stalin wanted to drive his reserves to the Baltic Sea and isolate and destroy the entire AGN. If AGN was destroyed the other two army groups would be in an untenable position. Mr Forczyk for having only 90 pages has written an informative, noteworthy story of this campaign and as such is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIDHIMWF96MQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849085528#wasThisHelpful","RIDHIMWF96MQJ","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is divided into two sections. The first part which takes up nearly two thirds of the book begins in mid October and lasts until mid November when Marshall Zhukov launches his Operation Uranus. After a brief first chapter of section two covering the quick entrapment of 6th Army within the Stalingrad sector, the rest of the book describes the conditions the trapped men endured as they desperately wait for the relief column to free them and of course the difficulties that Manstein with his meager resources faces in defending the Chir River line while Hoth fights his way north toward Stalingrad.The author was able to put together an interesting package though less demanding than hoped for of the tactical summary which is carefully blended with many examples of personal hardships and heroics of German soldiers as well as an abundance of good photos to tie everything together. The photo gallery is a combination of personal photos of the people discussed as well as providing scenes of the death and destruction within the city. The gallery which included some aerials was well done but some of the photos have lost their clarity.The broad strokes deliver the tactical history to provide the reader an overall image and scale to the battle but the presentation of all the soldier's experiences within this massive environment of death and destruction is what the authors enjoys delivering and hopes will make the biggest impression on the reader.The story is driven by the German advance on the northern factories and the German perspective dominates but the author also includes Russian daily action reports to help balance the story of how both sides saw the progress of the battle. Mr Wijers weaves this story together from primary documents like war diaries of different divisions, personal diaries and personal interviews.I believe this story will appeal to the causal or new reader of the Stalingrad conflict or those who are looking to read the human side of war while more experienced readers who have already read David Glantz's ""Armageddon in Stalingrad"" will immediately see the sparseness and lack of depth of the battle history for control of the three main factories. On the other hand, ""Winter Storm"" with its human interest side will supplement the bigger tome in that department.Mr Wijers also supplies a few maps, a bibliography and an index but an appendix of facts or notes are absent.Though expecting a probable wide divergence of ratings, I gave this story four stars for the author did a good job of covering the battle within the limits he imposed on himself and if you're not expecting an exhaustive tactical rendition then you'll probably will like it as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDU1640FJS9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811710890#wasThisHelpful","R2KDU1640FJS9F","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr Schaufler has edited a nice verbal history of the war in the east. The story begins with the Germans crossing the Bug River in June 1941 and ends with the fall of Danzig at the end of the war. It excludes the fall of Berlin. The panzer divisions covered are the 4th, 9th, 11th, 16th, and 18th. There are many other divisions mention on an incidental level. Since the author was a member of the 35th PzR of 4th PzD, the 4th PzD dominates the entire book while the other divisions are covered in two or three engagements each. There were many areas covered but Operation Barbarossa and the Soviet counter offensive in December 41 is prominent and includes coverage of the 4th, 9th 11th and 18th divisions. The other major engagement covered would be the defense of Danzig at the end of the war. Other areas covered include Mtzensk, Gzhatsk, Stalingrad, Kursk, Orel among others. My favorite would be the coverage of 16th PzD during the reduction of the pocket of Stalingrad but the siege of Danzig was also good and I was able to learn some new things.Accumulating a wealth of primary information like divisional and regimental war logs, personal diaries and interviews during his lifetime, the author has weaved together a creditable war history. It's a verbal history by tankers and foot soldiers. Its personal and tactical; you won't see the strategic, the big picture brought to you by the upper echelons of command. Its also almost entirely from the German perspective; there is little specific Soviet information but the author doesn't pull any punches and presents what the men felt and said. Acts of bravery are of course mentioned as well.The author shows the hardships of fighting the war in Russia, not only fighting an endless pool of relentless enemy soldiers and partisans but also the freezing, snowy conditions in winter, the deep muddy swamps that the dirt roads turn into after a heavy rain as well as the endless steppes you have to travel when you're low on fuel. The book is almost evenly divided between the fighting of the enemy and surviving the elements. Much is said about surviving the sub-zero temperatures for man, horse or machine.There are a few hand drawn maps and a lot of good photos though some are quite gruesome. An appendix with OBs of the above panzer divisions including command history is provided but there are no Notes, Bibliography or Index.The author has also published ""Knight's Cross Panzers"", a book on the 35th PzR of 4th ID and would make good supplemental reading as well though there is some duplication between the two books.This is an interesting read though its not comprehensive or strategic and its one sided but there are many small skirmishes mentioned that I've never heard of and for that reason alone I enjoyed the book but I enjoyed it even more by reading about the deeds and thoughts of the Landser as they try to survive an impossible war.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24O1TLIWMSYDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811710793#wasThisHelpful","R24O1TLIWMSYDR","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is so much more than just the siege of Breslau and for those interested in reading about the last dying days of the Third Reich, its terrible living conditions, its distraught people and desperate soldiers then you'll want to read this story.The book begins with a capsule summary of Breslau in better days before the war with Russia. In fact, the people of Breslau had fairly normal lives during the war up to late 1944, missing all the Allied bombing that the western half of the country and Berlin received but the situation started changing as Konev and his 1st UF entered eastern Poland.Food and other essentials were running low, sadistic Nazi town leaders running amuck to control its people and doubts of winning the war crept into the minds of many turning the atmosphere dour though the propaganda of super weapons conditioned some into thinking Germany would still win the war.Using many first hand accounts from citizens, city officials, German soldiers, triumphant Russian soldiers plus insightful prose by the author, the book is a penetrating look at the psyche of individuals and a country that has fallen to unbelievable lows.The military overview begins in 1944 at the Vistula bridgehead, hundreds of miles from Breslau. In mid January 1945, Konev, the smart and ruthless commander of the 1st UF begins his last push to the German border with the quick penetration of the Vistula defenses and with each passing day and with each fallen village his armies conquer, the lives of the Germans in the path of this unstoppable Red machine is chronicled.During the long siege which occurred in the coldest days of winter, the author clearly describes the impact of the many days of shelling as well as the days of attack had on soldier and civilian defenders alike and despite all the death and destruction Brelauers endured. After the surrender on May 5th, Mr Hargreaves tallies up the losses and provides the general results of the siege.The story, looking at the lives of many different people living with death, destruction and misery while living under a nearly four month siege against an enemy that wanted to extract every ounce of revenge they could is quite a read and is highly recommended for people interested in the end of the war or would be interested in reading on how people cope under nearly impossible conditions.(There are many Notes and an impressive Bibliography is further reading is desired.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFF2KGI91XBIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848845154#wasThisHelpful","RFF2KGI91XBIY","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is typical Kurowski. Its an interesting blend of battle history and first hand accounts. The predominate coverage is within the division and the actions that they made or were made against them but you'll also get a glimpse of what the war was like in the immediate vicinity as well. You'll get to see how the PLD contributed to the surrounding front line. After a brief introduction covering the division's prehistory, activation and brief stint in Eastern Europe, the main theme begins with the division being in Normandy in June 1944. The PLD was used at times as a ""fire brigade"" and was moved around a bit. Its first action was to stop the British west of Caen in and around the Tilly area. In July the division was moved west to near the St Lo - Vire area to stop the Americans during Operation Cobra where they suffered heavy casualties. After being reorganized they find themselves as part of the Ardennes Offensive with special attention to the siege of Bastogne. After the failed attempt in the Ardennes, the Germans including the PLD make a fighting retreat behind the West Wall, the Rhine River and finally to the Ruhr area. The two biggest areas covered were the fighting at Tilly and at Bastogne.Along the way, the author includes many first hand accounts of the soldiers of the division: some serious and grave and others more lighthearted.If you have read the author before then you'll have a good idea of what to expect. Some of the author's earlier books weren't as consistently interesting, having slow passages to contend with. This book didn't have those slow areas; it won't be unusual to finish this book in one sitting.It had a few hand drawn maps and a few good photos. It also has an appendix covering a few of the officers and a list Knight's Cross recipients, a battle legend, an OB among other things. There is a decent Bibliography but a Notes Section and Index are missing.I enjoyed the book and think others will too. I gave it four stars because the coverage is good but not in-depth. You'll read what it was like for the men and tankers of the division living their day to day lives. You'll see their difficulty of going up against a superior Allied force that had an air force that was too much to handle. It was a time when the Wehrmacht was sharply on the decline and you see that too but continued to fight valiantly. The tactical coverage is brief in this brief overview. There is another book by Dr Steindardt called ""Panzer Lehr Division 1944-45"" that while is not as interesting to read as the reviewed book, has much more tactical detail on General Bayerlein and his division. It also has better maps and additional photos to study. Between these two books you'll have a much better idea of the hard fighting abilities of the PLD and its commander in the last year of war.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5PKZK18L7BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811701581#wasThisHelpful","R3J5PKZK18L7BR","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr McAteer, a lawyer by trade, is a fellow enthusiast who has invested many hours of his free time in studying the many aspects of the war. You can tell he has read extensively by the amount of information accumulated and presented in this book. This estimate is further confirmed by reading his expansive Bibliography. I've also enjoyed reading ""Absolute War"" and the recent ""Ostkrieg"" and as a comparison Mr McAteer has packed more info into his book than the other two authors have for the corresponding time period. In addition to the historical facts, the author adds creditable analysis and opinion to the narrative. Much of this commentary is welcomed but a tiny amount of this personal commentary can be debated.The book begins as the clock rolls over into the new year, 1944, with a description of the military and political circumstances of the battlefield as well as on the home fronts. This introduction is deliberate and gives the reader a good background as to how the war had been prosecuted to reach the current results and conditions of both sides. By now the Soviets had turned the war and were pushing the Germans out of Russia and into eastern Europe. The Soviet Ukraine campaign to cross the Dnepr River, entrap Manstein at Korsun and then push into Romania begins the battle events. The author then works his way north along the front to Leningrad. Once in eastern Europe, the author does a good job of covering not only the military aspects but also the political and diplomatic nuances as well. As the new year evolves Romania, Poland, Carpathian Mts , the Baltics and especially Hungary are discussed. Yugoslavia, Greece and Slovakia are also mentioned but to a lesser degree. I would have liked a little more material on Prussia and the battle for Berlin but it was adequate. Many key people are also discussed as well as the human condition in cities like Warsaw, Budapest and the atrocities committed.There is a lot of information presented but its not, on a relative basis, evenly distributed along the entire time period but its not a severe issue. The author is neutral with his coverage, not unduly favoring one side over the other, though there may be a little more material on the German perspective. The information covered is specific and includes operational aspects like key dates, towns captured, deployments, ground gained and casualties and more. Throughout the presentation the author also highlights certain statistics that have been presented over time as facts as being suspect and should be discounted.As a summary, maps are probably not as essential as in some books but it would have been nice to have a few key area maps. No photos are included as well. A decent Notes section and Bibliography is included. With as much info packed into this book, one feature that is essential and was missing is an Index. A comprehensive index makes research so much easier; if you want to find a particular event or person, you'll probably have to invest a lot time finding it.Though having some minor criticism of this book, I recommend reading it for the many facts that can be found in a single volume of a period that is somewhat neglected. The book presents a good overview of the last third of the war and its ideal for new students and casual readers who prefer having only a few books on the war. More experienced students could take advantage of this fact filled presentation as well but will find not having an Index as a stumbling block to your research though the Notes Section should help on a limited basis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BFM638Z0PLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434961591#wasThisHelpful","R25BFM638Z0PLO","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr Stahel's new book is an addendum to his earlier ""Barbarossa"". It has the same style and format of the first book but with an extension of content. The author felt compelled to write this book to fortify his arguments of his first book. Old ground from ""Barbaroosa"" is renewed then new material on the Smolensk sector is added. To further enhance his position, Guderian's march south, Rundstedt's drive east and Kleist's advance northward to join up near Kiev to trap Kirponos's Front is then covered. The difficult crossing of the southern Dnepr near Dnepropetrovsk will also be included as well as the troubles in the Leningrad sector for this time period. The author is covering all his bases in presenting his arguments.Like the author's first book, this book has as its predominate theme the command decisions of Hitler, Germany's industrial shortcomings that couldn't adequately supply the front lines, the confusion and discord that was engendered within the German command structure that had terrible consequences for the Germans. He will provide many more examples of the losses the Germans endured in fighting this ""successful period"" of the war against a relentless foe. If you still weren't convinced after reading ""Barabarossa"" of Germany's lack of ability to win the war then you should read ""Kiev 1941""; there is much more to consider.Drilling down some, the key points that were brought out in the first volume are reestablished here: The Russians, despite being unprepared and poorly led were able to slow the Blitzkrieg along the Dnepr. Though Hitler made the right choice is sending Guderian to Kiev, much of his overall strategy was haphazard and random. Also playing large is the cowboy tactics of Guderian who cared only for the victories of his 2nd PzG no matter the consequences to AGC. The friction between Bock and Guderian is continued as 2nd PzG advances toward Kiev. Halder's shortsighted and poor planning of Barbarossa plus his impact over the arguments of the Moscow first strategy are also covered. Hitler's overall negative impact on the war effort is frequently visited. Stalin and his obduracy at Kiev is given good mention as well. Mr Stahel uses his vast knowledge of archival material to good use in these areas.The author points out a number of Guderian events that appeared favorable in the short run but turned out poorly for AGC in the long run. Last but certainly not least that despite the outward appearance of a highly successful advance in the opening weeks, the Russians were inflicting too many casualties on men and machines which the Wehrmacht could not afford or sustain. The Germans were winning battles but losing the war.Also mentioned: By the end of September and clearly by the end of December when Churchill, FDR and Stalin, the leaders of the three greatest economic powers in the world joined forces, Germany had little chance to win a long war of attrition. That position would be bolstered with the successful counter-offensive in front of Moscow.I gave this book five stars for the author did a good job of covering material that was within the purview of the book but I have to mention my disappointment for the brief tactical battlefield coverage and analysis that was provided on the Kiev march and encirclement. I knew this book would not be like a Glantz, Zamulin or Nipe book but the series of events that took place in August and September in the Smolensk and Kiev sectors were gargantuan, with far reaching tactical impact and I was hoping the author would add greater depth and a little more excitement to his tactical coverage of Hitler's ""greatest victory"". Though some of this material will be new for many of us, much of this material can be read elsewhere but the melding of the individual parts of the two books into a coherent thread of thought was appreciated. Though enjoying both books and having gained an appreciation of Mr Stahel's abilities, I would have wished that the material in both books could have been included in just one book. The considerable duplication could have been avoided and the sequencing and organization of material could have been more succinct, making it easier to follow and understand for the new reader.I will comment on one issue that the author brings up that refutes earlier authors. Its been said by others that Guderian's advance to Kiev was relatively quick and easy and that Eremenko's attempt to stop the Germans went poorly. Though Guderian did reach his objective, his forces suffered heavy casualties and the advance was difficult due to poor logistics, bad road conditions and hard fighting. Also, Guderian had to go back to Bock for reinforcements several times. In the end, his men were exhausted and his vehicles in need of repair and with Operation Typhoon coming up in early October, there would be no real time to recover. The Red Air Force was also more effective in destroying German equipment than what is generally known.Mr Stahel did a nice job of incorporating many first hand accounts to supplement his narrative. Using communiques and personal, divisional and corps diary entries, the author bolstered key points of his narrative that in many cases also showed the personal side of war.The brief but succinct Conclusion sums up the war conditions by the end of September and includes how the weaken Wehrmacht will have a difficult time with Operation Typhoon and the taking of Moscow. The author repeatedly shows the strategic weaknesses of insufficient industrial output and manpower. The author also shows the Germans making the same mistakes that over time would cost them dearly. The combined knowledge in both books gives the new or casual reader a big step forward in learning the pros and cons about Hitler's war doctrine, his country and his war machine during the early stage of the war.Also provided are 13 b&w maps that were created by David Glantz. The style is similar to the maps in ""Barbarossa"". The maps are very good, highly detailed that show the deployments and course of the battle but some of us will need a magnifying glass to study them carefully. There are also 21 photos. The Notes Section and Bibliography are exemplary and will be of great help if further research is required. An Order of Battle for AGC but not AGS or the Soviets is provided??I must stress again that while this book is praiseworthy from the strategic perspective and though there are examples of tactical history, this is not a David Glantz equivalent that chronicles in detail the tactical history of a campaign. While a few tactical events like a town falling or a division crossing a river by a certain date are briefly mention, this brief glimpse is not the main theme of the book but only used to give the reader a chronological reference or to point out either a German mistake or an event that cost the Germans dearly through Soviet intervention. The main theme is to convince the reader that Germany, having suffered relatively high casualties in men and machines in these opening months, failed to defeat Russia while she was vulnerable and therefore wouldn't be able to defeat Russia in a long war of attrition.Mr Stahel's premise for both of his books is that the war will unfold exactly as it did and that the heavy cost in men, panzers, materiale and time of the Smolensk campaign plus the poor state of maintenance of the German heavy equipment at the end of the campaign as well as the low state of morale of the Wehrmacht will be the foundation for how the war will proceed. Coupled to this battlefield scenario is the fact that the German industrial capacity was insufficient to poduce enough panzers, submarines, planes, vehicles etc nor produce enough oil to run those machines or have a sufficently large enough pool of men to replace the large attrition rate to defeat the Russians.His position does not allow for alternative history to change the outcome of the war. Hitler made many mistakes tactically, strategically as well as industrially that if those errors had never been made could have had a dramatic effect on the war but Mr Stahel doesn't include these possibilities in his equations. To do so would be to elevate his book to a whole new dimension, something like Mr Mercatante's ""Why Germany Nearly Won"" and that was clearly laid out in the author's ""Barbarossa"" book as not an avenue he wanted to take.By writing this second book, Mr Stahel did a good job in bolstering his original position that despite the early victories, the German Army by Sept 1941 with its relatively deep irreplaceable losses in men, vehicles and panzers had lost its ability to win a drawn out war with the Soviets. Mr Stahel provides additional information on the Smolensk sector before expanding the battle zone to include the Kiev sector and even a glimpse into Army Group North's struggle with taking Leningrad and how it impacted AGC. The author also includes coverage of some of the troubles the Army Groups endured in preparing for Operation Typhoon and the non battle costs that the panzer groups paid for executing Hitler's Directive 34 (moving to the flanks). The amount of additional material presented certainly adds to the author's position while giving the reader an interesting strategic overview of this critical period that will have direct important ramifications to the war in the months ahead and indirectly to the years to come.I know the specter of defeat for the Germans is more noticeable at Moscow 1941, Stalingrad 1942 or Kursk 1943 but the author strives to find the most earliest timeframe, the ultimate earliest time when the Germans lost the potential to win the war and then explains his position. It will take a leap of faith for some of us to accept his argument but the author's two books are fascinating and are still worthy reads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25R61IJ4TSM3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110701459X#wasThisHelpful","R25R61IJ4TSM3J","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has been a good year for Operation Citadel fans for three good books have been published. Mr Nipe's is the last book published and its one of the best that I've read. It competes quite well with Zamulin's ""Demolishing the Myth"" (= Myth), though Nipe's book is from the German perspective and Zamulin the Soviet perspective. The comparison gets even better for both authors choose to concentrate on the 2nd PzC. Nipe takes the offensive side of the SS Corps while Zamulin handles the defensive side where the Soviets try to stop the SS. I haven't studied Nipe's ""Blood, Steel and Myth"" (= Steel) as much as Zamulin's but I've read numerous engagements of fortified hills and villages that are common to both books. I can already tell the coverage of both books is very good and reach near equality with each other.Steel, which has the same outside dimensions as ""Last Victory in Russia"" but has an additional 118 pages, opens with two introductory chapters which describes the legacy of Stalingrad, describing the losses the Germans suffered while they were forced back to the Donets River. You also learn about the Soviet Armies that did the pushing and which ones will ultimately be confronted in the summer. The second chapter details the officers and men of the three divisions making up the 2nd SS PzC. Some of the strengths and weaknesses are discussed among many other topics like preparations and deployments. The section was good but the Soviet General Staff Study translated by Glantz is more complete on the Soviet side in this area of prep and deployment. Special attention on the German side reminds the reader that German forces had still not fully recovered from earlier fighting in the year and that their panzer divisions were far from established levels. Hausser had far less than the 1000 or more panzers and assault guns legend claims he had. Hitler made things worse for Hoth when the dictator gave a battalion of Ferdinands to Model that were slated for the south.On the Soviet side, it emphasized how the Red Army had greatly improved and enlarged their tank assets since 1941 along with having some of the toughest officers around. They would be going into this German offensive with a large plurality in tanks, guns and men. The fact that the Soviets had months to prepare defenses also tipped the advantage to the Soviet side. These chapters will give readers a decent backdrop when the campaign starts.The rest of the book covers the fighting and is divided by chapters for each day. Each chapter concludes with a concise summary. The daily events are usually broken down by hour as well so the reader can have a clearer perception of battle events. It starts on 7/4 and ends on 7/17. This book has greater coverage than what the subtitle implies for the author does provide a daily summary of the activity of 48th PzC and 3rd PzC which provided flank protection for 2nd SS PzC. Each key division has its own section in the chapter; Mr Nipe is trying to make this book, with all its many facets, as easy as possible to follow. This book is easier to follow than ""Myth"" and the Kursk book by David Glantz though thats a very good book also. The infantry corps on the extreme flanks receive little coverage and there are a few instances of the panzer divisions on the flanks receiving modest daily attention as well.Much of the time the engagements are discussed at division/regiment level but in a few instances battalion or even company level is covered. Much of the book covers the ground action but coverage of the air operations for both sides are also included.Though this book is German centric, Soviet defenses and deployments are well covered but not to the same depth as the German side. You will know which rifle division or tank brigade or corps the Germans are going up against. You'll also learn other things like why 7th GA put up such strong resistance against 3rd PzC. The level of detail is comparable to the author's two earlier works. Mr Nipe does a nice job describing the operational movements and engagements as well as the targets and objectives. Key officers and men are also mentioned for the contributions made in leadership or bravery to each specific engagement. Strachwitz, Peiper, Wittmann, Frey, Decker and many others are discussed. The author also discusses the tactical errors the Germans made that would cost them dearly. The capture of Cherkasskoe and the loss of so many panzers by GD on the first day are good examples.The author also points out instances where the Germans were also uncoordinated during maneuvers whether between ground/air operations or between divisions that caused many casualties and slowed their progress. He also shows the ""fog of war"" where events were constantly changing and where if you had pivoted left instead of right or if you waited an hour or a day to attack a certain objective the results would have been much different. The simplicity and clarity of this narrative will give readers a chance to see Operation Citadel from the German perspective more accurately.As the story of the offensive unfolds, the author sometimes pauses his narrative to discuss and explode myths, misconceptions and falsehoods that have evolved over the decades. Items like how many and types of panzers the SS Corps or 4th PzA had. When it was decided and why the SS turned toward Prokhorovka or the number of tanks the 5th GTA and the SS deployed on the 12th and how many were destroyed. Issues concerning 24th PzC and the number of panzers it had and why it never fell under Hoth's control are also covered.One issue that was covered in ""Myth"" but not here is the pros and cons of the route chosen for 48th PzC and the new Panther Brigade. The rugged and sometimes marshy terrain in Vorskla/Pena River sectors was a bad choice for a Panzer Corps and especially one with nearly 200 Panthers having mechanical problems. Mr Nipe describes the terrain difficulties of the sector but doesn't explore alternative routes. Vatutin expected a heavier response from the Germans east of the Donets which had better lanes of travel for panzers.Quotes from prominent historians like David Glantz as well as fragments from primary documents are interspersed throughout the book. These sidebars, which are usually more operational in nature than personal, are helpful but are not as plentiful as you'll find in ""Myth"".In the final chapter, ""Myths and Conclusions"" among other issues points out and destroys the myths that have grown in popularity. He also compares the Reserves that were available for both sides. The Germans, in reality, didn't have reserves while Vatutin could fall back on Konev's Steppe Front. Konev still had four armies, four corps and an Air Army left which could have been used if Prokhorovka had fallen to LAH. That never happened so Konev's forces were used on the major counteroffensive.There are 11 gray maps. Four maps are double page so you may consider 15 maps in all. There is a map for each day for 48th PzC and 2nd SS PzC. These maps are large and cover not the entire battle range but just a little more than just the area of that day's advance. These maps carry almost all of the key hills and villages discussed in the narrative as well as the key deployments for both sides. These are some of the best and most useful maps you'll find. They will help you follow the tactical progress of the offensive as well as helping the reader determine where the hard fighting centers were situated which were along the defensive belts that were built prior to the offensive. For some reason the 3rd PzC had minimal coverage on these maps. The areas of Shakhovo and Rzhavets were incomplete. ""Demolishing the Myth"" has a good map of 3rd PzC advancement. I had a little trouble reading the German spellings but it does appear that several key villages located along the southern bank of the Psel that SSTK had to capture were missing. In this instance, ""Myth"" maps can supply those villages. You will find that both books have areas of coverage that will supplement the other book and is a good reason to have both books if you're an avid fan of the campaign.There are 312 photos and the gallery is excellent in showing key German officers, soldiers, panzers and battlefield destruction.The Appendix is also noteworthy for its useful information. It includes an abbreviated Order of Battle for both sides (Myth's OBs are more extensive on the Soviet side), panzer breakdown by division and type, SS Division organization, a Panther profile, German casualties, and mini profiles of 58 SS officers who fought in the operation. It closes with a Glossary and Rank Compairson. End Notes and a Bibliograpy of Primary and Secondary sources are included. The Bibliography is not as lengthy as I imagined but its replete with noted historians. A useful Index completes the book.Mr Nipe has spent years studying the critical battles in the sectors north and south of Kursk and his three books are excellent examples of that hard work. For approximately eight months of 1943, the author covers the critical battles at Kharkov early in the year and follows that with his latest book in the southern Kursk salient. His third book covers the important German defensive in the Mius/Mearla Rivers sector, southwest of Belgorod, of late July, August period which was a critical period after Citadel was canceled. The combined trilogy is most informative and insightful to the serious student.Mr Nipe's new book, even though some of the ""new"", myth busting information presented had already been discussed by Zamulin and Lloyd Clark in their new books, presents an overall nice package that includes pertinent operational historiography that's insightful and easy to follow, helpful maps and great photos. This would make a solid learning tool and great collector item for all Citadel fans and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WAVABKCT26MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0974838942#wasThisHelpful","R1WAVABKCT26MC","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as scale goes, with respect to area and manpower, the German encirclement at Cholm was one of the smallest. The nearby pocket at Demyansk plus Korsun and Stalingrad dwarfed it but the German resistance at Cholm along with nearby Demyansk played an important role for if the both pockets fell, the Soviets would have had a good chance of reaching the Baltic Sea and isolating AGN. With AGN destroyed, the other two Army Groups would be forced to retreat or be destroyed as well. Stavka made the capture of Cholm a high priority and 3rd Shock Army's 33rd RD did everything possible at great loss to themselves to liquidate the pocket but ultimately failed their orders. The Soviet's job was made even tougher by the extreme cold and heavy snows that hit that sector. It was the harshest winter in 150 years.This background info begins the book along with telling how these two pockets were formed when Zhukov's counter-offensive of December 1941 pushed the Germans back from Moscow.The depot town of Cholm, located on the Lovat River halfway between the towns of Staraya Russa and Velikie Luki is also an important road junction that would have to be used by the Soviets to reach the Baltic. It had to be taken.This nearly six month drama of survival against a relentless enemy and the harsh elements was recreated by primary documents and is told as a daily chronicle. All the battle action is describe and then the casualties are added up at the end of the day. If you have read any of Mark's other books then you'll know what to expect. The writing style, format and level of detail is exactly like all of his earlier books. The daily coverage begins on Jan 18 and ends on June 9, 1942. The chapters are broken down by month. The Soviets who were frequently being fed reinforcements would attack nearly everyday as well as many long cold nights. On the days with no offensive, the pocket would be heavily shelled. Of the nearly 5500 Germans who fought in the pocket, many were killed and the remainder were wounded or fallen sick. Very few men were lucky enough not to be a casualty statistic. The pocket which followed the contours of the river was in relaively flat, open ground, providing little protection to the Soviets. The attackers often made suicide runs against the German line and lost many times that number. The battle coverage is contained to the pocket; there isn't detailed coverage along the line in either direction.Some of the accompanying photos show Cholm practically leveled; the terrain barren, looking almost like a moonscape. The attacking Soviets so often got near the front trenches that the Germans had used thousands of grenades and were often low on ammo.With the terrain so rugged and the snows so deep, the only way to resupply the trapped men was by plane or glider. The Soviets did squeeze the pocket smaller to the point that planes couldn't land their cargo and were forced to airdrop but the Germans held on until the relief column arrived in the spring. This aspect of the resupply was heavily covered. Maj Gen Scherer, the commander, plays the largest role in the story but many of the officers and men, to varying degrees, are also sited for their determination and bravery against a growing depression and a superior enemy. (The general is on the cover.)Mr Mark also includes an extensive Appendix which includes a 21 page section of mini biographies of German officers as well as a listing of all units that were represented in the pocket. This is in addition to the first hand accounts provided in the story.There are 350 photos which includes an assortment of aerial photos which greatly complemented the 22 computer generated maps. These aerials and the maps will greatly help the reader understand the physical layout of the battlefield. The photo gallery was excellent. An extensive Notes Section and a Bibliogtaphy is also provided as is an Index.While the scale of this siege can't match that of Stalingrad, it was still an important engagement at an important time that prevented the Soviets from potentially destroying AGN. I gave it five stars which is a little generous for it has little info of the Soviets but from the German perspective it was richly covered, providing a level of detail that allows the reader to see what it was really liked being isolated, cold and being attacked nearly everyone of those 105 days. High recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8CMAAMVMOEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975107690#wasThisHelpful","R3J8CMAAMVMOEH","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This single volume summary is a synthesis that has been meticulously crafted using the best scholarship from a huge array of top authors to present Hitler, his Germany, his invasion and attempted extermination of Russia. There is literally pertinent or interesting information on every page.The reasons for Hitler's action are wide spread and include restoring German prestige after the defeat of WWI, gaining breathing room for the German people, confiscation of Soviet natural resources, the defeat of Communism and its threat to Europe and the forcing of Churchill to sue for peace. As the subtitle indicates Hitler's overall extermination program and Nazi ideology is also covered. You will also receive a competent summary of the operations of the war from Barbarossa to Berlin which will include accurate analysis and conclusions. You'll read about Hitler's paranoia and obsession to keep gained ground regardless of the cost and his constant meddling with his generals that would create a huge rift in the Wehrmacht. Besides the operational aspects of the war, the national strategic, industrial, economic weaknesses are also explained. The author is concise and you will receive a good all around fundamental look at the war from the German perspective, not to mention a lot of information to digest. The sixteen page Conclusion admirally sums up the book, tying everything together.To gain more than what this well constructed synthesis has to offer, it would take you a large investment in time and money reading segments of the many books by Glantz, Erickson, Bellamy, I Kershaw, R Kershaw, Evans, Tooze, Nash, Werth, Zetterling etc. If you did want to pursue your studies further, Mr Fritz also presents a 53 page Bibliography that is worth its weight in gold that could lead you to German, English and American treasures. The equally large Notes Section will help greatly if you need clarification on certain points.The photo gallery is also good and clearly shows the human suffering and wanton destruction of the war. Some of the photos can be seen in other books.There are only seven large area B&W maps that show German axes of attacks in a general way but are absent of other tactical details like deployments and boundary lines. While pretty good, I was still disappointed with them, wanting more. The maps in Bellamy's ""Absolute War"" are preferable. The small Appendix presents a good array of statistics of casualties and production figures.If you're looking for a one volume summary of the military and political aspects of the war from the German perspective, this should be given strong consideration. Its highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PE0TQ54WB9ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813134161#wasThisHelpful","R3PE0TQ54WB9ED","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this operational narrative that was housed in this 9 in by 12 in 256 page book. Its really intelligently written by the collaboration of three experienced historians: Duncan Anderson, Lloyd Clark, Stephen Walsh. While the main emphasis is placed on Barbarossa, Stalingrad, Kursk and Berlin, there is much more to this book. It also covers the Moscow counteroffensive, Rostov and the early days of the Caucasus, Operation Bagration, the fighting along the Narva River, the Vistula and Oder Rivers campaigns. There is also a lot of little items like a discussion of the"" Byelorussian balcony"" or the German aerial sneak attack on American B-17s deployed at Russian airbases. The raid caused so much damage that the US canceled further aerial bombing of the Eastern Front from bases in Italy.After reading this book, new and casual readers will have a good general understanding of the war plus learn a few small gems of knowledge that are not widely distributed.In addition to the concise narrative, there are approximately 20 color maps and many photos. A few of the photos are in color. The many photos are interesting but some of them can be seen in other books. The maps are in color and show the general axes of attack. They're easy to follow but aren't excessively detailed. A few color illustrations are also included. While a Index is included, a Notes Section and Bibliography are absent.This book was assembled and published by most of the same people and resources that published Stephen Walsh's earlier independent book, ""Stalingrad"". If you have read this ""Stalingrad"", you will immediately see the similarities of the cover, maps, photos and writing styles; you will know what to expect from this reviewed book. If you liked ""Stalingrad"" then you'll like this book.If the authors were limited to this page count then this would be a five star book; it was filled to maximun benefit. However, as good as this book is, it could have been a little bit better by adding thirty or so pages of material to expand the width and breadth of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CSY2L8YM0N1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0715311824#wasThisHelpful","R2CSY2L8YM0N1V","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anybody who wants to read about the Campaign for the first time or for those who have read about it a long time ago, this would be an excellent overview to read. To the best of my knowledge, it contains the latest scholarship that refutes some of the exaggerations that have been around since the battle. One area that Mr Clark frequently visits concerns the number of tanks that were destroyed and the subsequent numbers of remaining tanks available to the key corps and divisions to continue the battle.In addition to the ground action, the author frequently touches on the air war, showing examples where a battle was won or at least not lost with the help of their air forces. Extending the coverage further, partisans ambushing a supply convey that would never reach Hoth or visiting a field aid station with overflowing patients waiting for attention or sappers trying to clear a mine field during a bitter battle and more are presented in this book. The key officiers like Vatutin, Rotmistrov, Hausser, Manstein and others are discussed with mini profiles developed. Appraisal and analysis is also provided which was good and accurate but with a depth that was a little less than can be found in books by Glantz or Zamulin.Considering the format and content of this book, I would consider this ideally suited for new or intermediate students of the Campaign. Of the 382 pages devoted to the main section of the book, only 174 pages cover the campaign. The other 208 pages are directed to the first years of the war from Barbarossa to Kharkov 1943 to the buildup for the invasion. The history of the two countries and their dictator's rise to power since the end of the Great War begins the book.As a comparison Valeriy Zamulin's recent book, ""Demolishing the Myth"" consumes 559 pages on just the operational aspects of the Campaign.Along with the narrative are ten maps; six are small scale maps of the salients. They're quite helpful showing key sites and deployments of key units as well as axes of attack but I would have liked more of the villages and fortified hills displayed and not all of the Soviet units were shown. The maps were spread out throughout the book but from my perspective weren't aligned with the story very well. In some cases the reader will have to scroll back to hunt for the map that displays the information that is currently being read. A small photo gallery is also provided.Both salients are covered but the southern battle is more dominant. The book is also German-centric but the Soviets are still represented fairly well.There is a very capable Notes section and an impressive Bibliography of primary and second sources if further study is desired. An abbreviated Order of Battle for both sides is helpful as well. The author also quotes Glantz, Nipe and Carell. There are a few typos but nothing that would cause a lot of confusion.This is an interesting, easy to follow story that will provide sufficient operational information that will probably satisfy most readers and plenty of first hand accounts blended seamlessly into the story to show what it was like fighting in a tank, a plane or a trench during this horrific battle. This is a quality effort and if you have an interest in Operation Citadel, you should consider reading it.FYI: This book is the exact same book as the author's ""The Battle of the Tanks"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0YDPF6ZQ1GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0755336380#wasThisHelpful","RX0YDPF6ZQ1GA","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good but select overview of Operation Barbarossa. While there is one chapter of the German drive toward Leningrad and another chapter on its drive toward Rostov in the south, the major emphasis covers the advance of AGC toward Moscow as well as the Soviet counter-attack that repulses the Germans from entering the capital in December 1941. It also emphasizes Guderian's 2nd PzG's march south in September to assist Rundstedt's AGS in closing the Kiev pocket. Some of the battles of AGC include the capture of Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev pocket, Vyazma, Bryansk, Orel, Mozhaisk, Kaluga, Kalinin and the attempt on Moscow. It also shows that with so much armor with AGC, the flanks had a difficult time taking Leningrad and Rostov.The objective of the author is more than describing the introductory status and conditions of the two sides and the military highlights of the Operation; the strategic significance of the book is to show the Germans were able to advance and destroy Soviet armies at first but by December 41 when it reached the Leningrad, Moscow, Rostov line, it had reached its zenith, had exhausted itself and didn't have enough men and panzers to finish off the Soviets. By the time it reached Moscow their own large casualties and the extended line prevented the capture of Moscow and through implication that the Germans actually lost their chance to defeat the Soviet Army. An important element within this overview was the author's coverage of the controversy within the German ranks of rather it should go straight on to Moscow from Smolensk or delay AGC's advance and have Guderian divert to Kiev to relieve flank pressure before moving on the capital.Mr Glantz covers the actual historiography in some detail on the advantages and disadvantages of taking Kiev first before moving on Moscow but then only briefly states the general reasons why going straight on to Moscow in late September when the Western Front was preparing defenses was the wrong strategy and gives little hard core numbers or other facts to support this contention. You are to accept his word as accurate during the narrative though some of his supporting material can be found in the Endnotes but it can be a trying process to navigate for the casual reader.The author's presentation of the Kiev first strategy may be more convincing to hardcore contrarians if a credible scenario could have been developed showing the Moscow first strategy failed worse than the Kiev first strategy. The scenario would begin showing 2nd PzG defending near Roslavl through 9/10 and launching with AGC toward Bryansk after Timoshenko canceled his offensive. The time sequence of this new scenario would be somewhat different than actual history due to different launch times and locations, strength status, defense preparations and deployments as well as different reinforcement schedules and weather etc.The conclusion was short but credible and was the glue that binds this book together. It started by explaining why the Soviets were completely unprepared for the invasion: the recent purges, poorly trained soldiers, inexperienced officers, inadequate defenses at the new border and obsolete weapons and equipment. Mr Glantz proceeds to list the many strategic mistakes Stalin and the Red Army made in the opening months. Then a list of changes the Stavka started to implement to improve their Army that would eventually lead them to be the equal and then surpass the Wehmarcht is provided.On the German side, a concise discussion of Hitler's changing objectives of Operation Barbarossa that would delay the advance of Moscow and cause friction within the Army is prominent. The author expands this train of thought to briefly describe the difficulties AGC would have had if it did advanced past the Desna River toward Moscow in September without ever sending Guderian southward. The chapter was concise and covered the key points but greater depth of the existing points (as mentioned above  would have made the book more compellng.There are eight useful B+W maps that show the general deployments and axes of attack that complement the narrative well. Since this is not a tactical reconstruction like the author's Barbarossa Derailed series or his Stalingrad series, the author didn't feel it necessary to have many maps.The Notes Section is very useful and provides a lot of secondary information if you take the time to study it. The included Appendix has Orders of Battle and key documents like Hitler's Directive 34 and 35 to study. A Bibliography and a few photos are included as well.As a summary, I gave this book five stars for it covered the necessary points to argue his position that despite the early successes, the Germans were unable to defeat the Soviets while they were vulnerable and that in a long war of attrition, Germany couldn't defeat the larger, improving colossus that was the Soviet Army.Though enjoying the book and freely recommend it, I found myself and suspect other enthusiasts of the Eastern Front will want more after finishing the book. The author's new book, ""Barbarossa Derailed"" does add to the key points of this book in a limited fashion and is also recommended as is Bryan Fugate's ""Operation Barbarossa"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6XR7D1TWBI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752460706#wasThisHelpful","R3U6XR7D1TWBI7","AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXFQ4OGQ8MFOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is mostly a good deal, but there are some negatives.  On the plus side, if you purchased all of this track separately it would cost about two hundred seventy dollars.  So, you are getting a bit of a discount on the track.  Also, Lionel FasTrack is a nice track system.  It snaps together easily and looks good.  Some say that it is a bit on the loud side, but to me, it is fine.  On the negative side, this layout requires about 8.5 by 4.5 feet of space.  Most people end up putting layouts on 8 by 4 sheets of plywood, so this would require a odd size table.  You could reduce it in size by replacing a 10 inch track on each side with a 5 inch track and it would then fit.  As is, this is just track without a transformer.  If you are buying a transformer, you would need at least a CW-80 to power this.  If you already have a set that came with a basic loop of track, then you are better off buying the additional track to make this layout separately.  If you are trying to expand a basic loop of track, then instead of this, consider getting the figure 8 pack and then add a few switches to make a siding or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R292P0M6K04KAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L679W14#wasThisHelpful","R292P0M6K04KAX","A5ZUCLRHA3VEY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZUCLRHA3VEY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of the triangles on Amazon in this price range are similar.  Each leg of this triangle is a about six inches long and the striker is also six inches.  Six inch triangles are pretty light so they tend to spin and swing, but that is expected for this size triangle.  Overall, triangles come in different sizes - 4, 6, 8, 10 inches are common.  For little children, this is a nice size.  The striker is just bent metal without a handle, but that is pretty typical for smaller triangles.  We like to use a variety of items as strikers since that is what produces different sounds.  For example, knitting needles or wooden spoons.  If you can buy this in the five to seven dollar range, then it is a nice way to encourage children to participate in music.You might also consider the ""Lyons 25 Note (G-G) Bell Set with Case"" which typically sells on Amazon for twenty dollars.  For about twelve dollars more than the triangle, you can get a nice, tuned, entry-level xylophone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RESDPR5KDDEHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002Y2UES#wasThisHelpful","RESDPR5KDDEHZ","A5ZUCLRHA3VEY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZUCLRHA3VEY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are several lengths of Fastrack. The most economical in terms of cost per inch of track is the 10 inch track. However, there are times when you want to adjust your track in less than 10 inch increments. For that, Lionel sells Fastrack that is 5 inches, 4.5 inches, 1.75 inches and 1.375 inches. Using different combinations of these allow you to construct sections of Fastrack that are almost any practical length. All of these look the same and snap together the same way.

"We bought a few switches to make our basic loop more fun. The switch comes with a quarter turn piece of track. You can change the side that the switch post is on from the left to the right. This is helpful since the post can get in the way on some layouts. It is well built and trains make it smoothly across the switch without derailing. They are a bit expensive, but it makes your train set more fun. Be careful when ordering because there is a left hand and right hand switcThe red switch post that you turn to open and close the switch can break. If this happens, you can buy a replacement post. To remove the old post, pull straight up on it. Then push the new post into the place. I agree that Lionel needs to make these stronger. The replacement part number is 6102017094 RED SIGNAL LEVER / FASTRACK MANUAL SWITCH. It costs less than $4 and you can buy it at a hobby shop or Lionel sells replacement parts at lionel dot com.One last recommendation which has nothing to do with the switch - to make your set more fun consider adding some 1:43 scale cars, fire engines, buses, trucks, etc. Just search Amazon for 1:43 diecast. This scale is about the same as O-gauge and you can find some fun items at a reasonable price","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVAX1VOWEUNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006TW7OM#wasThisHelpful","R1WVAX1VOWEUNP","A5ZUCLRHA3VEY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZUCLRHA3VEY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lensed in 1971 at the beginning of the Grindhouse Exploitation boom of the '70s, BLOOD AND LACE makes its way to us in a beautifully restored DVD/BluRay combo courtesy Scream Factory. The presentation deserves more merit than the film itself--the parts definitely greater than the sum.Teenager Ellie Masters (Melody Patterson, F-TROOP) is sent to an orphanage after her promiscuous mother and Mom's trick of the hour meet their maker by way of a nasty hammer bludgeoning, seen through a lengthy POV camera shot. Vic Tayback (ALICE) plays the detective working the case and Milton Selzer Ellie's hospital case worker. 1950s Film Noir Queen Gloria Grahame takes the role of the widowed Mrs. Deere who runs the orphanage with an iron fist and Len Lesser (SEINFELD) plays her boozy right-hand man. Mrs. Deere is a conniving witch who has some secrets in the attic and others in the deep-freeze in the basement.Despite an intriguing premise, the movie never lives up to its' potential. There's a mishmash of ideas that don't quite gel together; the direction is flat like a Made-for-TV movie and some of the acting by the teenage orphans is substandard. Patterson is especially shrill and unlikeable and Tayback lacks the gruff bearish persona we all know him for on ALICE. Still, it's one of those cult titles that people seem to love despite the problems.Scream Factory has given us a beautifully restored print. The title card however reads THE BLOOD SECRET which is actually a more appropriate title and the discs are in widescreen but have been cropped at the top and bottom. I posted some comparisons in the IMAGES section from my old VHS copy and this new release.Not as gory or sleazy as it should've been and some bad acting taints it overall, but worthwhile for seeing Grahame slumming it and some early work from Tayback and Lesser.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SJH05W68096E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145UQSAQ#wasThisHelpful","R2SJH05W68096E","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**NOTE: This review had to be re-worded in order to meet Amazons strict guidelines**Set in a small backwoods town, THE FARMERS DAUGHTERS opens with the local sheriff enjoying some afternoon delight with his pie-baking wife (Gloria Leonard credited here as Gale and easily the best thing about this picture) while his three curious, horny daughters spy on them from outside. Local goon Fred catches the girls in the act, and for this transgression is bound, gang-assaulted, humiliated and the lucky recipient of a three-head, warm amber shower.Meanwhile, three cons have escaped from the nearby prison seeking refuge at the farm where they proceed to have their way with Gloria and force the daughters into a fellatio and back door orgy culminating in the convicts giving them amber showers (Karmas a bitch, isnt it?) at gunpoint. Fred comes to the rescue, but because hes not one to easily forgive-and-forget, the girls and their parents are forced to commit perverted acts of inter-family relations until the explosive climax (PUN INTENDED).A dirty and grimy experience complete with excruciating close-ups of pubic hair, ugly bodies with appendicitis scars, grimacing female faces registering the pain of being rear ended, this definitely NOT a date movie. This is quite the raunch-fest and the fact that the picture hasnt really been cleaned up for DVD release is actually appropriate considering the sleaziness of the film itself.

"Being a fan of 70s Grindhouse flicks, I could easily oversell this dud by telling you it features a deranged butcher-knife-wielding transvestite, lots of gay subtext, psychedelic camera tricks during the murder sequences, copious female nudity, geriatric junkies and a do-it-yourself Caesarian section. Tempted? Dont beMARTHA is so flatly directed and shot and devoid of any real suspense or sleaze and scored in such an incongruous fashion the whole thing comes across more like a demented episode of THE DORIS DAY SHOW or any other innocuous single camera TV sitcom from 1971.**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**Shacked up together in suburban Florida, Paul the older of the two (and a dead ringer for Andy Kaufman) dresses up in drag as Aunt Martha to reckless Stanley (who looks pretty long in the tooth for eighteen; but that may be due to all the coke he snorts with bodacious blonde Barbara Eden-wannabes). The two are on the lam for a robbery/murder that the drug-addled Stanley committed in Baltimore.Pauls cross-dressing isnt of the twisted PSYCHO sort; hes just trying to stay under the radar and its played more for comedy as he resembles those 1960s and 1970s character actresses such as Maudie Prickett or Priscilla Morrill with the sensible shoes and frumpish frocks he dons for the charade. Its quite the bizarre sight seeing the hirsute and shirtless Paul character pace around the house still in skirt and lady-loafers with his hairy chest exposed while chomping on a cigar, all man from the waist up with grandmotherly lower half.Stanley seems to be all for peace, drugs and free love yet weirdly freaks out and calls for Paul every time a member of the fairer sex attempts to get into his pants. There is an ambiguity to their relationship as the two are seen sleeping in the same bed and its never made clear whether Pauls possessiveness of Stanley is jealousy or protection. The nudity is far from titillatingone drugged-out dancing girl has repulsive breasts that look like shriveled turnips.The restoration of the film print is minimal; there are still issues such as interlacing and burn marks throughout but the picture looks much better than it did on VHS or Youtube.If youre a fan, you will want it for the improved video quality and the commentary, otherwise theres not enough of anything (its not creepy enough, sleazy enough, suspenseful enough or funny enough) to make it enjoyable for fans of 70s Exploitation.

"Ace Records knocks it out of the park again with another Lesley Gore remaster, this one boasting the original ten tracks from 1967s CALIFORNIA NIGHTS album plus a whopping ELEVEN Bonus Tracks from the albums MY TOWN, MY GUY AND ME (1965) LESLEY GORE SINGS ALL ABOUT LOVE (1966).Though this LPs title track reached #16 on Billboard (and was a bigger hit in Canada) and proved she was moving forward as her 1963 contemporaries the Beach Boys had done, radio did not embrace the artistic evolution of Lesley Gore. Its a mystery as to why because this material was up-to-date at the time and there was plenty of missed opportunities for singles from the groovy, frenetic, hand-clap heavy British-flavored OFF AND RUNNING to the slow, sorrowful CRY LIKE A BABY (not the Box Tops hit) with lots of tambourine and fuzz guitar. Lesley uncharacteristically snarls her way through THE BUBBLE BROKE which is refreshingly darker than anything she had done before.Among the best of the Bonus Tracks from 1965-66 are the bouncy MY TOWN, MY GUY AND ME which is like a fast-paced DOWNTOWN while the soothing and heavenly LET ME DREAM and ONLY LAST NIGHT also have much in common with Petula Clarks output during this time. The Sesame Street producers apparently stole their theme song sound from START THE PARTY AGAIN; I WONT LOVE YOU ANYMORE (SORRY) has a lush sound awash with strings, speaking of which Lesleys spectacular version of the Teddy Bears TO KNOW HIM IS TO LOVE HIM is just as great as the 1958 original and features a spine-tingling string section. I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU and YEAH, YEAH, YEAH (THAT BOY OF MINE) are fast-pumping, playful songs reminiscent of Jay & the Techniques' ""Apples, Peaches, Pumpkin Pie"" that feature great backing vocals.Sound quality is of course excellent and the material is wonderful and definitely better than whats found on the subsequent MAGIC COLORS Deluxe CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD7XG8BQO3NJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTN1CC2#wasThisHelpful","RD7XG8BQO3NJZ","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A curious artifact more than anything else, LOVE ME BY NAME dares to show a different side of the former Queen of the Teen Weepers, but after listening to this album a dozen times I still dont know exactly what she or producer Quincy Jones were going for here. Theres a common celestial vibe that runs through most of whats here. The title track is a strange hybrid of space-age jazz, while the hyper PARANOIA comes off as something that was cut from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW although Lesley does spit out the lyrics convincingly enough. IMMORTALITY tries to be both futuristic and retro and echoes First Class hit single BEACH BABY on the chorus. Both GIVE IT TO ME SWEET THING and CANT SEEM TO LIVE OUR GOOD TIMES DOWN suit her voice better and would not have been out of place on her prior album.A lot of the material seems a mismatch for Lesley and nothing here shows off her vocal abilities in their best light. Both her 1972 album SOMEPLACE ELSE NOW and 1982s THE CANVAS CAN DO MIRACLES are much better than this oddity from the mid-1970s so avoid paying the high prices this album is commanding on various auction sites.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJXN0LXD9PC6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JG4SAO#wasThisHelpful","RJXN0LXD9PC6L","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though none of Lesley's signature tunes appear on this album, GIRL TALK is most representative of the girl-group pop sound with which she is so synonymous and on the whole is the best album of her career IMO. The Ace Records remaster sound amazing and is the way to go since it contains 13 Bonus Tracks! A few of her second-string hits appear on this disc, ""Maybe I Know"" (my personal favorite song of hers), ""Hey Now"" and the original version of ""Look of Love without the Christmas bells.The best thing about this disc is that there are some delightfully moody numbers here such as ""Little Girl Go Home"", ""Say Goodbye"", ""I Don't Care"", and especially the gritty, pessimistic ""I Cannot Hope for Anyone"". It's refreshing to hear Lesley display such attitude on these hidden gems. Anyone who liked Patty Duke's gloomy ""Don't Just Stand There"" will love these!Other highlights are the dramatic and slower ""Don't Deny It; the Phil-Spectorish ""I Died Inside"" which is driven by lively castanets; ""Moving Away"" somehow transcends its simplicity and cuteness (it doesn't hurt that the background vocals are superb); ""You Didn't Look Around"" combines a myriad of '60s musical styles. It has twangy Ventures-type guitar, blaring ""Bend Me, Shape Me""-type horns, Four Seasons/Angels' clomp-clomp rhythm/handclaps as well as the charming triangle from Lesley's own ""It's My Party"". This everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach actually works much better for this song than it sounds on paper.Lesley sounds refreshingly sassy on fare like ""Sometimes I Wish I Were a Boy"" and ""Wonder Boy (which shares the same beat as the Vandellas' ""Heat Wave) proving she wasn't all sugar and spice. It should be noted that the mix of ""I Just Don't Know If I Can"" which sounded rather muddy with Lesley's vocals somewhat buried on the Big Bear box set has been rectified and can be heard in all its 1965 glory along with What Am I Gonna Do With You.Lastly, the fierce ""No Matter What You Do"" was a real departure for Lesley; a loud psychadelic-sounding/soulful rocker thats like a hybrid of Jefferson Airplane meets Aretha Franklin and proves that her range had widened greatly since her debut album just one year prior.This is the best Lesley Gore album there is, Buy It Now and if you own a previous version, upgrade to the new Ace Records remaster because these songs have never sounded better.

"Lesley Gores debut album contained too many standards and wasnt totally representative of the pop music sound of 1963, but such isnt the case for the sophomore effort LESLEY GORE SINGS OF MIXED UP HEARTS. This one never lags and the production is flawless and chock full of winners including three well-known hit singles. The sound on the Japanese remaster is incredible. The background vocals, handclaps and piano on the Top Five smash SHES A FOOL are more clear and audible than ever before and the hit single SUNSHINE, LOLLIPOPS AND RAINBOWS also appears here as well as the timeless classic YOU DONT OWN ME in a spine-tingling crystal-clear mix (the mono version has appeared on various previous releases).The bouncy, irresistible ""Hello Young Lover (You Ain't Gonna Get My Heart)"" which shares the same beat as ""It's My Party"" and sounds like it would be right at home in one of those old Elvis or Ann-Margret movies sounds ten times better here than it does on the 1994 Big Bear box set from Germany. The song is so wild and infectious I can't help but imagine Candy Johnson frugging up a frenzy in one of those '60s Beach Party movies--amazing the label never released it as a single.I Struck a Match basically steals the plot of ""Party""--but manages to be great in its own right; ""The Old Crowd""; ""Consolation Prize""; ""Run, Bobby Run"" and ""If That's the Way You Want It""--all of these are pleasant, lightweight pop songs about teenage love and heartache--Lesley's specialty and all have never sounded better than they do now.I still say GIRL TALK is Lesleys best album overall but this one runs a close secondget it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8MQ0OUKPRPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010VKR6A#wasThisHelpful","R1E8MQ0OUKPRPC","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This CD by WMO (Wonderful Music Of) is composed largely of mono versions and I recommend you skip this one and go for the Ultimate Petula Clark CD by BMG Heritage. It features the cover photo of Petula sitting on a rock by the water barefoot. The sound quality on that collection is amazingmuch better than whats found here. It is only 2 dollars more and you get 21 tracks versus the 16 here.

"With a premise tailor-made for AHS, Season Fours FREAK SHOW stills brings the thrills and chills but unfortunately an early demise of the seasons creepy killer, an underwhelming finale and some sloppy writing and clichd storylines hold back what could have been perfection.Set in 1952 Jupiter, Florida in a travelling sideshow, Miss Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange) acts as surrogate mother to her little monsters who inhabit Elsas Cabinet of Curiosities, but she also has designs on a show-biz career like Marlene Dietrich and resents anyone stealing her spotlight. This allows for some anachronistic musical numbers to appear as well as songs on the soundtrack such as David Bowies FAME. Hearing these as well as a performance of Nirvana by Evan Peters take the viewer out of the moment. The same thing happens when the writers carelessly slip in some crass hip-hop speak (who was saying Im trying to get a nut back in the 50s when referring to sex???).The season is somewhat of a homage to Tod Brownings FREAKS with several plot points liberally borrowed from the 1932 horror classic and many real-life human oddities among the cast to give it authenticity. It would not have worked as well without them and all do an admirable job. Most of the repertory players are back with Angela Bassett a standout as the sassy hermaphrodite (sporting an Ethel Mertz hairdo) and her strongman husband (Michael Chiklis) has one of the more interesting arcs this season. Frances Conroy does what she can with her limited role as a rich widow with a deranged, spoiled son (Finn Wittrock) and has the best line of the season when she tries to calm one of his violent rages by offering We can play June Allyson paper dolls. Kudos to the special effects department and Sarah Paulson as they have the difficult task of bringing the Siamese Twins Bette and Dot to screen with a premise much more difficult than the old Patty Duke doubles trick.The kills are some of the most wonderfully gruesome this show has seen, and juxtaposed with the bright, squeaky-clean image of the 1950s the images are doubly disturbing. There's some flashback footage to 1930s Berlin in which Miss Elsa is filmed performing acts of depravity which is truly unsettling as well as a flash-forward to 1962 that cleverly ties into ASYLUM featuring a cameo by Lily Rabe as Sister Mary Eunice and a chilling performance by Mare Winningham as evil personified.A tighter finale would have served the season better but theres still plenty of creepy enjoyment to be had in AHS: FREAK SHOW.

"If David Lynch and John Waters had teamed up to make a porn flick in the 70s, this is what the end result would probably look like. Filmed in glorious black-and-white and possessing a weird dreamlike atmosphere and long-winded soliloquies mixed with full-on graphic intercourse, ""Thundercrack"" is like nothing you've seen before. It takes the old horror film cliche of disparate travellers becoming stranded in a mysterious old house and not only turns it on its' ear--it knocks it on its' a** and penetrates with everything it's got!! Horny gorillas, pickled bodyparts, blow-up dolls, vomit-encrusted wigs,  ""Thundercrack"" will blow your mind!!For years, the copies being sold here were bootlegs and the quality is what you'd expect from 2nd or 3rd generation VHS dubs. Synapse Films has been working on a fully-restored, 180-minute director's cut for some time and its taken forever since (as one of their reps stated) ""this thing looks like it was shot on toilet paper"".Finally, just scraping under the wire to be released in time for its 40th Anniversary, comes a restored BluRay release with the Bonus Features fans have been dreaming of for years including outtakes and audition footage. I ordered mine direct from their website so hopefully it will arrive early and I will post screen grabs and comparisons here but if you love offbeat cinema and weird 70s Exploitation flicks, this one is a MUST-HAVE on day of releaseget it!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ER0COK2Q8VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161W43X0#wasThisHelpful","R11ER0COK2Q8VY","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its like a mean-spirited, 2010s female version of THE ODD COUPLE but cruder with bathroom humor, sexual innuendo and fast-paced silliness that has nothing to do with reality and makes the show feel like a live-action cartoon with its fast pace and quit-cut editing.The cast are fine with Dreama Walker playing the chipmunk-cheeked idealist June new to New York and sharing an apartment with the tall, angular selfish party girl Chloe (Krysten Ritter) and James Van der Beek playing a self-absorbed parody of himself.THREE STARS.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8HZVN2K0RHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPUN57K#wasThisHelpful","R2W8HZVN2K0RHW","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1982s SO EXCITED is a bit of a comedown for the Pointer Sisters from their last few albums as much of this material is subpar compared to what came before. HEARTBEAT and HEART TO HEART TALK are pure filler and the lackluster I FEEL FOR YOU pales now that everyones more familiar with the bombastic Chaka Khan version. Even though AMERICAN MUSIC enjoyed some minor chart success, its blandness has made it one of those lost 45s.Despite the average numbers, the scorching IF YOU WANNA GET BACK YOUR LADY more than makes up for those and justifies the purchase of this CD even if the rest of it were garbage. LADY is the Pointers best dance number ever, besting even everything on the BREAKOUT album. Other winners include the forbidden love triangle saga SEE HOW THE LOVE GOES with its slightly ominous chords; ALL OF YOU with the smooth and simmering verses bursting into a rousing chorus and of course the original rendition of the timeless IM SO EXCITED.An okay album overall but not as good as some of their others.

"What a difference a year makes! While only released twelve months before 1978s stellar ENERGY album, The Pointer Sisters 1977 HAVING A PARTY album is stylistically worlds away from its follow-up and is recommended for completists only,This is the last album Bonnie recorded with her siblings before embarking on her solo career and her vocals dominate much of this material. All the songs also go on much too long to the point where they wear out their welcome and sometimes it gets to the point where it seems the Pointers have been asked to join in on a jam session with the band going on and on and the girls just trying to endlessly ad-lib to keep up with them (most obvious on the jazzy BRING YOUR SWEET STUFF HOME TO ME).Though recorded in the latter part of the Me Decade, much of this album sounds like a throwback to the early 1970s R&B sound. I NEED A MAN, though one of the stronger, more memorable offerings, would have been right at home on the soundtrack of SHAFT or any Blaxploitation flick with its chunky guitars and sassy ghetto vocals. The other standout is the slinky DONT IT MAKE YOU CRAZY which is driven by hypnotic bassline.Other than those, the rest of the album is forgettable and can be skipped without missing much. Its definitely NOT worth the exorbitant price the import CD is commanding. TWO and a HALF STARS.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DG7UWD4U4T6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMDW900#wasThisHelpful","R2DG7UWD4U4T6N","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overproduced and much more dated than Contact or Hot Together, much of this material would be fine for the upstart divas of 1988 such as Pebbles or Paula Abdul, but it comes off as rather cheap and juvenile for established vets like the Pointers.  This is especially true of Flirtatious, the title track Serious Slammin, as well as Shut Up and Dance the latter two lacking in good hooks or melody.The slick dance production comes off much better on the catchy He Turned Me Out and both Pride and Uh Uh, two really punchy, assertive tracks. There are some other highlights here and they include the beautifully moody and laid-back Moonlight Dancing and the closer I Will Be There which starts off unassuming and gradually builds to a memorable declaration of loyalty with explosive synth accents. My Life is inexplicably recycled, remixed and included from the last album (but to be fair this version is superior) and the lone ballad Im In Love has Ruth on lead.The production here is typical late 80s: brash, cluttered and overpowering but there are enough good numbers to still make it a worthwhile purchase for Pointers fansits just not one of their better albums or up to the standard of Energy or Breakout.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJQ2PFVT0JF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FGQ09W#wasThisHelpful","R1RJQ2PFVT0JF1","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A commercial disappointment when released in late 1986, The Pointer Sisters HOT TOGETHER boasts some of their sassiest, sexiest material in retrospect and is definitely worth dusting off nearly three decades later. I do recommend shelling out for the Big Break Records release that contains the Bonus Tracks though because while 12 mixes could be superfluous back in the 80s with nothing more than a minute or less of extra instrumentals, the longer versions here of MERCURY RISING and GOLDMINE as well as the remix version of MY LIFE definitely pack more muscle than the originals with thicker percussion that sounded more tinny on the album.The best tracks are the slick MY LIFE and title song HOT TOGETHER, infectious GOLDMINE (their most underrated song ever), MERCURY RISING (remember how standoffish they were to their lovers advances on FIRE? Well, MERCURY is the flipside with the ladies now trying to quench an insatiable romantic appetite) as well as the gorgeous ballad ALL I KNOW IS THE WAY I FEEL. The remainder of the original album is mostly composed of very dated-sounding filler with SAY THE WORD and SET ME FREE being the best of the bunch but they too are mostly generic and forgettable.Like 1982's SO EXCITED and 1988s SERIOUS SLAMMIN, this is not one of their very best albums, but it does grow on you with repeated spins and contains some of the best songs in their catalog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VCOA8G1Y6KQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E69V#wasThisHelpful","R3VCOA8G1Y6KQ4","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"E.G. Daily is the daughter of actor Bill Daily (Major Healey on I DREAM OF JEANNIE and Howard Borden on THE BOB NEWHART SHOW) and released her debut album in 1986. Not sure if Daddy used some of his residuals to help finance this venture, but Elizabeth Ann was able to secure some of the hottest producers in the music biz at the time (Jellybean Benitez and Harold Faltermeyer, among others) and the result is an overlooked, professional, polished album that deserves more credit than it got.The cute and infectious single SAY IT, SAY IT inexplicably only reached #70 on the Billboard Singles Chart, though it did make #1 on the Dance Chart. It certainly deserved better as being a Jellybean production it has the same appeal as Madonnas early singles. Theres a cover of SUNSET PEOPLE on which Ms. Daily almost holds her own against Donna Summer. LOVE IN THE SHADOWS is another highlight and E.G. comes across like a young Pat Benatar with a touch of Kim Carnes trademark rasp on the spunky cuts WAITING, IS ANYBODY HOME and DONT LET THEM TAKE THE CHILD AWAY.Make no mistake, despite the fact she was a looker, E.G. Dailys WILD CHILD album is no piece of kittenish fluff like her contemporaries Stacey Q or Regina. This material has much more depth and more in common with Patty Smyth/Scandal and Laura Branigans up-tempo tunes than with the disposable Madonna-Wannabes of the mid-80s.Retro radio needs to be unearthing music like this instead of playing GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN or HOLIDAY for the zillionth time.FOUR STARS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5505BX9VXCXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WV1E16#wasThisHelpful","R5505BX9VXCXJ","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If the album and single version of Janet Jacksons NASTY was too sparse and stark for your listening tastes, then the Cool Summer Mix is the version for you. Not only is there some added percussion, extra keyboard riffs and background keyboards added, but there is sampling of WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY and some other experimental sounds on this version (squeak toy sounds among them) that fans will love as well as a cool echo effect.

"At a full nine-minute running time, Dead or Alives fall 1986 release of the 12 version of BRAND NEW LOVER: The Dust Monkeys Love Bubble Mix is not only their crowning artistic achievement, but its also the pinnacle of the Hi-NRG movement pioneered by Stock, Aitken and Waterman and gets my vote as the best extended mix of the entire 1980s dance music landscape.I remember seeing this in the record store in October 1986 and grabbing it sight unheard and hoping it would be as good as the previous singles from YOUTHQUAKE which was a pretty tall order consider how fantastic those extended mixes were of SPIN ME, LOVER COME BACK, and MY HEART GOES BANG.From the opening notes to the second when Petes voice began stuttering back and forth between my speakers I knew this one was going to be explosive. In fact, the opening instrumental salvo is the best part of the song, with the classical violins soothing the ears only to be shattered by that musical c*mshot of electric guitar solo. When the song finally does start, the melody and lyrics are much more substantial than SPIN ME, yet not at the expense of its danceability.An intoxicating dance-floor masterpiece and again, the best Hi-NRG song ever made, ahead of everything else by DOA, Divine, Hazel Dean, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQQBB9YHRWJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AVNIJI#wasThisHelpful","R2TQQBB9YHRWJT","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive never been one for ghost or haunted house stories, but American Horror Story draws you in with its intricate plotting, surprise twists and excellent cast. I began with Asylum, which was great, so I didnt expect that this debut season would live up to that, but it did. The goings-on in this show are just CRAZY and you watch it like a train wreck, mesmerized by all the chaos. The writers rarely tip their hand, so the twists are not telegraphed, though the clues are all there beforehand, so the audience has no reason to feel cheated.Jessica Langes character is so mysterious, yet likeable, you cant wait til she appears onscreen again. The show is full of accomplished actors, young and old who all really sell this material. Its like a great combination of those 70s psychological thrillers like Burnt Offerings crossed with Desperate Housewives, yet too competent to qualify as a guilty pleasure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HVZLOOU5CCVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAJ1O0#wasThisHelpful","R3HVZLOOU5CCVD","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me preface this review by stating I normally have no interest in movies and programs that deal with zombies, witches, vampires and the like. Ive never seen an episode of The Walking Dead or True Blood but a colleagues recommendation prompted me to check out American Horror Story and having read the synopses of the series so far, I decided Asylum would be the best place to start since the premise sounded the most intriguing (well, at least since S4 isnt available to purchase for another two months).From the creepy David-Fincher inspired opening credit sequence I was hooked and although the season borrows elements of everything from Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Silence of the Lambs and The Exorcist to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, everything works. The storytelling overlaps and flashes back and forth in the timeline but the program is cohesive. The cast are terrific and its great seeing former Six Feet Under alumni Frances Conroy (as a creepy yet beautiful Angel of Death) and James Cromwell (in a deliciously wicked role) reunited onscreen. Sarah Poulson and Evan Peters will have you rooting for them all the way and Lily Rabe reminds me so much of a young Julia Duffy.But its Jessica Lange who steals the show. Kudos to Ms. Lange for not falling victim to the Hollywood vanity trap of Boxtox injections and facelifts to maintain an illusion of youth. Theres no way she could have pulled off the complex role of Sister Jude/Patient Judy if her face was unable to register the range of emotions required. Its because of her I am now working my way through Season One and will eventually get around to seeing the rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZC9Q9R1QS5L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADQPB50#wasThisHelpful","RZC9Q9R1QS5L4","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following the breakout success of their hit single FIRE, 1979s PRIORITY album was somewhat of a commercial disappointment for the Pointer Sisters. Perhaps the problem was that this album was not diverse enough to please a broad spectrum. Instead its a collection made up entirely of Bluesy Rock that paints that gals as a female version of Grand Funk Railroad or Bad Company. Not that they arent up to the taskon the contrary, the girls tear into this testosterone-charged material like Ian Hunters WHO DO YOU LOVE, Gerry Raffertys BLIND FAITH and Bob Segers ALL YOUR LOVE with ball busting vigor that rivals Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Tyler or any of the other lady rockers of the time. Like their previous album ENERGY, the material consists largely of cover versions of established acts and writers, but the Pointers totally make them their own.Graham Parkers TURNED UP TOO LATE, The Rolling Stones HAPPY,  Springsteens SHES GOT THE FEVER and Robbie Robertsons THE SHAPE IM IN all get a female makeover to great effect and IMO the albums best moment comes when the gals warn DONT LET A THIEF STEAL INTO YOUR HEART which is like the female answer to the Eagles WITCHY WOMAN and has the same sinister vibe.Those who are only familiar with NEUTRON DANCE or JUMP may find this album too abrasive but for those who are interested in how masterful the Pointers were in conquering the traditionally male-dominated arena of Blues-Rock, PRIORITY is quite the revelation.FOUR STARS","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDV9RKLCOKMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9UAJUS#wasThisHelpful","RFDV9RKLCOKMW","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On MEETING IN THE LADIES ROOM and KLYMAXX the group had cultivated a sound that was all their own. There was no confusing them with contemporaries such as The Pointer Sisters, Mary Jane Girls or The Flirts. Not so on THE MAXX IS BACK on which the production is no different than anything at the time of Bel Biv Devoe, Pebbles or Johnny Gill. This monotonous sound is a large reason why I loathe the R&B and Dance music to come out of the early 90s for the most part and why this album largely fails IMO. Its in my music collection because Im a completist but this is one of those CDs that sits alone at the bottom of the pile largely ignored.On the title track, they sing about returning with a new identity, the same old savoir faire but nothing could be farther from the truth. This album is little more than generic beats, annoying, cluttered (now terribly dated) 90s production and lackluster songwriting with no ear-catching melodies or clever hooks or diva anthems like THE MEN ALL PAUSE, SEXY or FASHION.

"On MEETING IN THE LADIES ROOM and KLYMAXX the group had cultivated a sound that was all their own. There was no confusing them with contemporaries such as The Pointer Sisters, Mary Jane Girls or The Flirts. Not so on THE MAXX IS BACK on which the production is no different than anything at the time of Bel Biv Devoe, Pebbles or Johnny Gill. This monotonous sound is a large reason why I loathe the R&B and Dance music to come out of the early 90s for the most part and why this album largely fails IMO. Its in my music collection because Im a completist but this is one of those CDs that sits alone at the bottom of the pile largely ignored.On the title track, they sing about returning with a new identity, the same old savoir faire but nothing could be farther from the truth. This album is little more than generic beats, annoying, cluttered (now terribly dated) 90s production and lackluster songwriting with no ear-catching melodies or clever hooks or diva anthems like THE MEN ALL PAUSE, SEXY or FASHION. Even the lyrics this time are trite and the girls seem to be coasting or just filling an obligation to the label. The fact the group has been whittled down to a trio may also have been a factor.

"1978's ENERGY album is where the Pointer Sisters career finally picked up steam as producer Richard Perry helped sharpen their overall sound with a collection of material that showcased their diversity and let their harmonies sparkle (not to mention the band is incredible).Big Break Records have done a wonderful job remastering almost the complete Pointers' catalog and this is undoubtedly their best album of the '70s which is surprising since it almost entirely contains cover versions of songs recorded earlier by famous artists (and not just because it contains their first really big smash single, the timeless FIRE, penned by Springsteen). ENERGY features material from prolific songwriters such as Kenny Loggins, Bob Welch and Russ Ballard previously recorded by The Doobie Brothers and Fleetwood Mac among others but the Pointers totally make these tunes their own.My favorites here include their cover of Steely Dan's DIRTY WORK that features incredible spine-tingling harmonies and outshines the original; the thumping and infectious HAPPINESS should have been a huge Disco hit; the sultry grind of the aptly-titled HYPNOTIZED (much better than the Fleetwood Mac version) will do just that to your brain.Both the rocking LAY IT ON THE LINE and ANGRY EYES are a precursor to the kind of abrasive, harder material that would compose almost the entirety of their follow-up album PRIORITY in 1979, which does showcase their versatility but is not as diverse an album.I'm not so fond of the slower numbers such as Stephen Stills AS I COME OF AGE (great harmonies though) and the Sly and the Family Stone cover EVERYBODY IS A STAR but I'd rate this album 4 1/2 stars overall and well-worth getting as it's their best of the '70s.**There are 3 Bonus Tracks: NOTHING BUT A HEARTACHE is not noteworthy; LOVE IS LIKE A ROLLING STONE is another gritty number that would have fit well on PRIORITY and there's a 12' Disco Version of HAPPINESS that is a welcome addition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342S2ZZ3KI36L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073GVYJA#wasThisHelpful","R342S2ZZ3KI36L","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though Disco was a dirty word in 1980, the tainted genre's patron Saint, Miss Donna Summer managed to score a Top-Five hit early in the year with ""On The Radio"" which not only was the theme song from the Jodie Foster film ""Foxes"" but also the title of her best-selling Greatest Hits package. By the fourth quarter of 1980, it was time for another studio album from Summer to hit stores and that effort was ""The Wanderer"". Treading carefully to ensure this album would not immediately fall victim to the cut-out bins due to the Disco backlash (see Sister Sledge Love Somebody Today), the album is given a more pop-rock feel overall but still retains some Disco overtones as not to alienate those who fell in love with Donna's music in the first place. The result is a well-produced, varied effort that actually sounds better today than it did at the time.The title track went Top Five in November 1980 with the help of Giorgio Moroder whose production gives Summer's vocal a unique echo/reverb. ""The Wanderer"" the single also frames verses with some coarse guitar licks to balance out the techno aspects and give this one more radio-friendly sound than the hypnotic club anthem ""I Feel Love"". ""Cold Love"" was the second single which inexplicably bombed in early 1981, despite it being one of Summer's best performances on record and a perfect example of why she could have easily attempted a full album of rock-oriented material. The third single also failed to make big dent in the charts. ""Who Do You Think You're Foolin"" along with album cuts ""Looking Up"", and ""Breakdown"" employ a danceable pop-rock sound that continued throughout the first half of the '80s on which others such as Laura Branigan based their entire careers.The remainder of the album contains the eerie, futuristic synth number ""Grand Illusion"" which is made all the more hypnotic by Donna's high-pitched vocal; ""Running For Cover"" has a slick, sophisticated urban opening before breaking into a fast tempo for the rocking chorus making it the most musically ambitious cut. Fans of Disco Donna will love ""Nightlife"" which echoes the thumping percussion of ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls""; ""Stop Me"" is another musically ambitious effort that sounds very '60s bubblegum on the verses then rocks out on the chorus. ""I Believe in Jesus"" closes the album, and while I have nothing against Gospel, the melody isn't very catchy and arrangement just isn't exciting enough. Still, this remains a personal favorite of mine and sadly underrated album of Donna's. I prefer this over any of her 1970s efforts.FOUR STARS","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AGQKNM9UMY2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0FN5YK#wasThisHelpful","R2AGQKNM9UMY2F","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Boasting the same production values and sound as her landmark album ""Broken English"", Marianne Faithfull was worthy of commercial success in 1981 with the equally stellar but more radio-friendly ""Dangerous Acquaintances"". Seriously, the upbeat numbers on this album are so chock full of killer hooks, if they had been recorded by a more conventional female vocalist, we'd still be hearing them on radio today. But Marianne is anything but a sell-out and I'm glad these remain hidden gems.The punk-reggae sound that worked so well on ""Why'd Ya Do It"" gets some variations on the terrific opener ""Sweetheart"", which sets the tone for whole album. When Marianne cries ""My freedom means too much to give up now"" she sounds more apologetic than threatening. This album is not as acidic and nasty and pessimistic as ""Broken English"" but it's not Sheena Easton either.Horns and sax contrast the weary, depressed vocals on ""Intrigue""; there's a Motown vibe that comes through with all the tambourines and handclaps on ""Tenderness""; the simmering ""Easy in the City"" is easily the most infectious number; while the sinister guitars of ""Eye Communication"" contribute to the stalkerish feel. The funky '70s ""Brother Louie""/""You're No Good"" sound works well on ""Strange One"" which finds Ms. Faithfull's lover with a boyfriend of his own; she's at her most plaintive and introspective on ""So Sad"" and ""Truth, Bitter Truth"".I tend to think of this album as ""Broken English""-lite. It's a more upbeat Marianne and a terrific follow-up to her masterpiece. The Japanese remaster is definitely money well-spent.FIVE STARS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3RXGA5VJSBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUTEXFE#wasThisHelpful","R1J3RXGA5VJSBS","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kim Carnes' ""Lighthouse"" was released in 1986 and was her swan song for EMI records.

The shouting male chorus is prevalent on both of these. ""One Kiss"" is kind of bland; ""Begging For Favors"" on the other hand, is one of Kim's best album cuts ever with the melody and dirty little sax licks giving the song an appropriate seediness that matches the lyrics.

"Madonna's ""Rebel Heart"" is a mixed bag, but a step-up from 2012's ""MDNA"". First, the bad: the Electronica thing has been done-to-death since 1998 and that, along with the lyrical religious references have become beyond tiresome. Don't even get me started on the vocoder. A lot of the songs are overproduced but not to the extent they were on ""MDNA"". The absolute low point comes in the downright embarrassing, ultra-hyper ""Bitch, I'm Madonna"" where she tries to convince us how badass she is by employing hip-hop speak and yet another unwelcome guest appearance by the execrable Nicki Minaj. I guess if Minaj had to appear it would make sense that she show up on this unlistenable turd of a song which makes ""Gimme All Your Luvin'"" sound like ""Ray of Light"" by comparison.The good thing is that the songwriting is better than it was on the last album for the most part and there's an attempt at making a more diverse-sounding collection of songs for ""Rebel Heart"". The piano used on ""Living For Love"" gives the song a much-needed organic slant before the sick beats kick in on an album opener that is just the kind of irressistible dance number about spiritual empowerment that embodies everything Madonna (it helps that the song is everything ""Gimme All Your Luvin'"" WASN'T). The reggae-tinged ""Unapologetic Bitch"" scores points for originality; Madonna channels her inner coffeehouse chanteuse in ""Body Shop""; there's the unique militant/gospel fusion of ""Heartbreak City"", a stark confession of vulnerability in ""Joan of Arc"" and the understated ""Wash All Over Me"".Of the Bonus Tracks; the winners are the sultry ""Best Night"" with it's Middle-Eastern flavour and spoken passages reminiscent of ""Justify My Love""; the clever, lyrical checklist of past hits makes the self-reverential ""Veni Vedi Vici"" fun instead of what could have been annoyingly narcissistic. (Though it could do without the Nas rap at the end). There's an irresistibly moody piano riff (shades of Eminem's ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"") and hypnotic bassline that drives the cheeky ""S.E.X"" (which is like the musical equivalent of ""50 Shades of Grey""); and the charming and folksy ode to self-acceptance and title track ""Rebel Heart"" inexplicably didn't make the cut for the official album.The rest of the album offers nothing particularly noteworthy and is no better than anything she's done since ""Confessions"". There are no instant classics like ""Vogue"" or ""Hung Up""-esque earworms. This is an album I will use for mind-numbing workout music more than anything else, but I will give her points for better songwriting on some tracks than we saw on ""MDNA"". This would be a stronger effort if the Bonus Tracks had been made part of the official album with weaker tracks like ""Bitch, I'm Madonna"" deleted.All fans will have their favorites here, but IMO this would rate Five Stars if the album had been composed of these 11 songs:Living For LoveDevil PrayVeni Vidi ViciUnapologetic BitchS.E.X.Joan of ArcHeartbreak CityHoly WaterGhost TownBest NightWash All Over MeThree-and-a-Half Stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22P6EF299135Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RA10R6E#wasThisHelpful","R22P6EF299135Y","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How do you follow up one of the biggest singles of the 1980s?

"Of all Kim Carnes' albums, this one took the longest to grow on me, even though it was her best-selling and contains her signature song. The indelible keyboard riff from ""Bette Davis Eyes"" and Kim's trademark raspy vocal made it one of the biggest singles of the decade and is still well-loved and remembered nearly 35 years later.The synthesizers on this album bring a new dimension to the Country-Rock numbers and give them an '80s touch, though ""Hit and Run"" is oversung by both Kim and the backup singers and suffers for it. Conversely, ""When I'm Away From You"" is pure perfection with a terrific reverb-guitar solo.The lite-jazzy title track has Kim delivering a pensive, wistful vocal as she prepares herself to close the door on a dead-end relationship, while ""Break The Rules Tonight"" is a wonderfully brash, head-bopping, rousing roadhouse rocker. ""Still Hold On"" is an achingly desperate ballad with pretty chimes and another highlight is the simple synth-pop ""Don't Call It Love"" which recalls last album's ""More Love"" right down to a sax solo but this one's got a little more bite.The album's second single ""Draw of the Cards"" remains an oddity with Kim doing little more than chanting and shouting random bizarre phrases over a percolating, airy keyboard backing track and hypnotic, ominous bassline. The remaining cuts are the ballads ""Miss You Tonight"" and ""My Old Pals"" of which the former is the better of the two built around a synth backup and the latter is straight piano and the album's weakest link.While it contains her biggest hit, this album is not Kim's best effort overall. ""Cafe Racers"" and ""Barking at Airplanes"" are better albums, but if you aren't a big fan of the MTV-era synth sound, you will probably like this one better than those.FOUR STARS","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EDYWNADCELXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095V6CTS#wasThisHelpful","R1EDYWNADCELXY","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Australia's Raven Records gives us a 2-for-1 in this release that contains Kim Carnes' first two albums: 1979's debut ""St. Vincent's Court"" and the 1980 follow-up ""Romance Dance"".The first album is heavy on late '70s Country-Rock and Kim comes off little more than a Linda Ronstadt imitator on several cuts (""What Am I Gonna Do"", ""Jamaica Sunday Morning""). At the time, Kim hadn't yet fully developed that trademark rasp and at times she doesn't even sound like the Kim we know and love. She sounds like Toni Tennille on ""Paris Without You"", and Nicolette Larson on the jazzy, infectious ""Skeptical Shuffle"". The bass-driven, laid-back ""Lookin' For a Big Night"" is a highlight and Kim's rep as the ""female Rod Stewart"" is never more evident than on the bluesy ""It Hurts So Bad"". The rest of the first album is not bad but is quite forgettable.The second album kicks off with much more energy in the Rod Stewart-esque ""Swept Me Off My Feet (The Part of the Fool)"" which is like the female version of ""Maggie May"" and arguably the best cut included here. The two covers of '60s chestnuts ""Cry Like a Baby"" (The Box Tops) and ""More Love"" (The Miracles) also fare very well with the latter making a dent in the Top 40 during the summer of 1980 although it deserved to be a bigger hit than it was. Special mention also must go to the kickass country-rocker ""Tear Me Apart"" which Kim rips into with great gusto and to ""Where Is Your Heart"" because it's synth-heavy chorus foreshadows the musical direction Kim would take on her next album.This CD would play better if the best numbers from both albums were combined into one having weeded out the filler. For completists and a decent listen; just not as good as her '80s output. For a better representation buy ""Cafe Racers"" or ""Barking at Airplanes"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTISXL90UUSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000085RRG#wasThisHelpful","R2LTISXL90UUSE","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps I am biased since I've loved every one of Mink Stole's scene-stealing antics in all those John Waters movies, but I really like parts of this oddball album. This is one of those CDs that's great to have in the car to keep you amused during a traffic jam. It's unpredictable, diverse and for the sheer audacity of embarking on a singing career in her 60's, Mink should be commended.Though Mink's voice is too soft and fragile and lacks power (her version of Divine's ""Female Trouble"" done in light jazz-style lacks bite), she surprises every so often by lashing out on a song like ""Born of a Restless Spirit"".Cher's ""Bang Bang"" is covered in French and though I can't understand a word she's saying, Mink sells the song with a passionate delivery. ""Thank You Baby"" is a quirky cross between Helen Reddy and Spanky McFarlane and the lyrics are unintentionally hilarious (or are they?). Mink sings it so straight I can't tell if she's kidding or not.My personal favorite here is the blissfully forlorn and moody ode to her hometown ""Baltimore"" (written by and recorded in 1977 by Randy Newman--Mink's version is better) with an arrangement full of doom-and-gloom but other bright spots are when Mink channels Blondie circa 1977 on the fast-pumping ""Waiting for the World to Catch Up"" or does her best Astrud Gilberto impression on ""Sometimes I Wish I Had a Gun"". Mink does a terrific take of ""No Nose Nanook"" from ""Vice Palace: The Last Cockettes Musical"" which is a hybrid of Eskimo folk song and Broadway showtune.I'd rate this CD higher, but Mink's cover of Lyle Lovett's ""If You Were to Wake Up"" ironically has the opposite effect on me as does the duet with Arty Hill ""Yours and So Am I"" or the jazzy ""What Can I Say After I Say I'm Sorry"".Thought not for everyone's tastes. this album is a gas--so many absurd moments--intentional or not; but I give her credit for trying. Thanks...love you Mink!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SHFJCJY2FAIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZCC67Q#wasThisHelpful","R3SHFJCJY2FAIV","A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a ginger fanatic and have tried almost every ginger ale and brew on the market. At first, Bruce Cost Ginger Ale has a nice, crisp, clean taste. You can see the real flecks of fresh ginger floating in it, and it's clearly supposed to be an elegant, elevated soda both by taste and by virtue of only having four simple ingredients. But it is lacking in carbonation and a bit watery, especially as you near the bottom. By the time I got to the last few swigs, the chunks of ginger kept getting into my mouth and were totally gross. So don't try to drain the bottle! Where Bruce Cost Ginger Ale really lives up to its name is it ""costs"" more than any ginger ale on the market. Too bad it's not worth it. For my money, the best ginger ale is made by Maine Root. That stuff has bite!

"Let me begin by saying I own all the sets and most of the Promo Cards. I am a huge Dominion fan and avid player for five years now. This ninth expansion set is the best and worst of Dominion in one box. I do NOT recommend it be the first one you buy (try Seaside or Prosperity instead, then Dark Ages or Hinterlands). I say that because some of these cards are quite complicated and fiddly with a fair number of annoying new rules to remember. That's true of any expansion, but seems to be amplified here.My biggest complaint is the horrible cheapness of the new cardboard tokens. They are ugly, amateurish, and feel like they belong in a different game. Definitely NOT up to the same standards as the metal Victory tokens and gold coins of previous sets. With the exception of the tavern mat, the images are all too dark and tiny to read well, and the text (although easy to read) is weirdly right justified. These poor quality tokens are a cheapskate, rip-off move by Rio Grande Games who are usually much better at including quality components than this. I have never been more disappointed with this game than these new tokens.Now, on to the rest of my review: There are a lot of new cards of all prices, some quite fun, some not, and some so weirdly complicated, I can't be bothered to learn them. There are more orange Duration Cards (first introduced in Seaside), including ones that last the entire game once played. These seem too powerful, even at a cost of 6. Example: Hireling lets you draw 1 extra card per turn, every turn. I'd call this a 7 or 8, but it only costs 6.A new type of card is the Reserve Card, which goes on your Tavern Mat when played, then may be ""called"" into your hand on a subsequent turn to produce a secondary effect without costing an action. These are quite handy. The problem, like any cards that are set aside, is remembering to use them.There are two sets of Progression Cards that act as pseudo-adventurers you can upgrade all the way from a cost of 2 to 6, and each time you do, you swap out your current card for its next one up the chain. Each card has different powers, but the best are of course saved for the permanently put into play final upgrades that cost 6 and are super-powerful, including the Champion, which grants you +1 action every time you take an actionmeaning you can always play every action card in your hand. Oh yeah, and you're immune to attack cards too!So you can see there's a lot of interesting stuff going on with the new cards for the supply piles, but the super-star of this set are the new oversized Event cards, which do not form a supply pile (there's only one of each event). Instead, they stay in play all game and available to buy their effect just for that turn by using one of your buys on them. Examples include getting +2 Buys and place one of the gained cards on top of your deck, or placing a -2 cost token on one of the supply piles so that future purchases of it by you cost 2 less. You generally use one or two Event Cards per game, and these really change how the game is played. They breathe new life into the game and are the best possible way to get this game back on the table if your group has grown tired of it after all these years. Note that the Event Cards are of the same high quality as the rest of the cards (it's only the new tokens that have the quality control issues).By the way, the new regular cards and Event Cards are easily integrated with the previous sets, so you can mix-and-match things however you want. This has always been one of Dominion's greatest strengths. I'd like to issue a warning that the example set up games they included are horribly designed and not much fun, but that's been a problem in the past too. Just pick cards randomly and you'll probably create better, more balanced set-ups without even trying. And don't play with too many of these new cards in any one game or you'll go nuts remembering all the new rules.To sum it up, if you're already a Dominion fan, you're going to want this, and even the horrible cheapness of the new tokens shouldn't stop you from buying it. But if you're new to Dominion, save this purchase until well after you get a few more expansions sets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FISDSTBW33D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF7YMVW#wasThisHelpful","R8FISDSTBW33D","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An astronomer and a handful of former green berets discover the government is covering up a massive asteroid strike that will hit North America in 90 days. The asteroid will kill 90% of the population when it strikes and create a nuclear winter from the resulting dust and ash in the atmosphere. There is nothing that can stop it. The berets purchase a decommissioned missile silo and set about stocking it with supplies to survive 18 months underground. They also invite 50 people (mostly single mothers and their kids) to join them to give the human race a chance to survive. Meanwhile, the world outside descends into chaos, turning all ""Mad Max"" with warlords taking over and turning to cannibalism to survive (hence the book's title).I listened to the audio book and enjoyed it. The narrator was good and production level excellent. As for the story itself, it was pretty good, but the prose (though well-written for a first novel) was a bit dry and took forever to get to the apocalypse. The asteroid didn't even hit until near the end of Disk 4 (of 12), which is way too long. On the other hand, once I resigned myself to the fact that this was the direction the author wanted to go, I began to appreciate the level of detail he put into how the decommissioned silo was being set up, stocked, and populated: who and what was chosen to survive in the shelter and why. I liked Jack, the main character and commanding officer, for his confidence and sense of humor, as well as his vulnerable streak.Cannibal Reign takes a more thoughtful approach to how the apocalypse would go down than the cheesy B-movie title would indicate. This is both its greatest strength and weakness, because it didn't match my expectations. So in some ways, I got more than I paid for, and in other ways, I got less. With a more serious, less exploitative title, I may have had fewer issues with the long, drawn-out beginning of the book that was firmly stuck in ""prepper"" mode. Then again, without the gory title, I might never have picked it up in the first place. It definitely jumped off the shelf at me. It isn't really a horror book though, despite some of the horrific things that happen in it.The one thing I hated about the book was the code-breaking sections, where huge chunks of code were thrown at me in the most boring, obnoxious way possible. These seemed to drag on forever. I fast-forwarded past them, much like I skipped past all the boring cathedral-building architecture descriptions in The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett. Nobody reads these kind of books to get that level of academic detail. We signed up for action and adventurean interesting insight into other people's livesnot a cryptography lesson.Another, lesser issue was the sprawling, split-nature of the story. While the majority of the book focuses on the Green Berets and missile silo, some chapters spend time on other characters in different parts of the country. Yes, these characters all meet up with the Green Berets sooner or later, but it made the story seem a bit bloated. In other words, it messed with the pacing.Overall, I liked Cannibal Reign because the author tried to do something a bit different while still hitting a lot of the ""check boxes"" fans of the post-apocalypse genre want.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WIHO9EQPL0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062025821#wasThisHelpful","R20WIHO9EQPL0D","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this book more, but found Peter Rabe's writing too cold and detached to get into. Noir should be white-hot, desperate, doomed, and sexy. All I got out of these stories was desperate and doomed. They take way too long to get to the action, and without an engaging femme fatale, fall flat in the sexy department. I've read a lot of Rabe's Gold Medal contemporaries like Gil Brewer, Bruno Fischer, David Goodis, Jim Thompson, etc., and managed to enjoy them even at their worst. These two novels (The Box and Journey into Terror) are supposed to be Rabe at his best. Not a good sign. That said, they're certainly readable, but I don't get how anyone could put Peter Rabe in the same class as the other authors I mentioned. This book does include three different bios of the author that I found more interesting than the actual novels.Also, the Stark House version I got had one of the worst, most amateur-painted covers (not shown in this listing), poor cover and interior design, and plenty of embarrassing typos. Not sure if they cleaned it up for whatever version they're selling now (with the boat on the cover), but I doubt it. Stark House does a good job finding rare noir but a poor job presenting them (although the bonus author bios are always a nice touch).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQQIZR5C3LSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=096678488X#wasThisHelpful","R3QQQIZR5C3LSE","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never played Descent, but everyone else in my group has, and this is basically the same game with a Star Wars theme added on. It plays like a role-playing game without any role-playing, just co-op tactical miniature battles. It is similar to the old WotC Star Wars Minis in this regard, but better--except that game had prepainted minis, and a lot more to choose from. The minis in Imperial Assault are clearly superior in detail, but unpainted.Unlike Star Wars Minis, where you can just throw any old map down and start fighting, Imperial Assault's set up takes forever and is confusing with all the tiles to choose from, especially since you can't organize them numerically in the box (this is due to the radically different sizes involved).The quality of all the components is excellent, very sturdy, from the minis to the map tiles to to the little punch out damage and condition tokens. We did find it impossible to completely assemble the AT-ST Scout Walker, however. The laser cannon under its ""chin"" won't fit no matter what we do, and we're afraid of breaking it if we try to force it any harder. Other than that one problem cannon, the AT-ST snaps together no problem.We played two games, the basic ""learn how to play"" scenario, and the first adventure in campaign mode. Campaign mode gives you better abilities and the chance to earn money from completing missions to buy cards representing better weapons, armor, or equipment. This is fun and allows you to customize your character, similar to leveling up in Dungeons & Dragons.You begin play as either a melee combatant (like a jedi) or a ranged combatant (like a stormtrooper), but with campaign mode, you can add ranged or melee weapons and powers. You need a mix of ranged and melee types to win. Jedis are good, but not too unbalanced against non-jedi. I played a Rebel sniper and kicked plenty of Imperial butt with my blaster rifle. A third type of character you can play (the officer) isn't great at any kind of fighting, but excels at giving bonus actions to others in the group (like Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars, or the warlord class in Dungeons & Dragons). Everyone enjoyed their roles. It did seem like the clock running down and a lack of focusing on mission goals and teamwork was a far bigger threat than any of the Imperial forces we encountered. Not that the Imperial player didn't have nasty surprises in store for us, but the nastiest of these were environmental (like putting force fields around key computer terminals we needed to destroy) than actual bad guys. Maybe they get tougher later on...It takes a roughly 2 hours to play each game. I enjoyed it and would play it again. Imperial Assault does a good job evoking the Star Wars theme, and is a fun co-op experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NKXS0EJ934G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616619902#wasThisHelpful","R17NKXS0EJ934G","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally got to play this after waiting fifteen years due to disappointing reviews and high cost. I would say the poor reviews are justified.CON's: The game is unbalanced initially in Japan's favor so it's absolutely no fun for the Allied players (especially poor India/Australia), and then it becomes unbalanced in favor of America thanks to its enormous income. They can replace an entire fleet in a round or two, whereas Japan is doomed if it loses that many ships.Also, it becomes impossible for the Japanese to conquer either India or Australia against a decent, experienced Axis & Allies player if that player uses most or even all the British convoy money for building stacks of infantry in India, and again in Australia (when threatened). Maybe it's not broken, but it's not a lot of fun either.The 40+ page rulebook lacks an index, so it's a pain to look stuff up, even though it's decently organized.PRO's: The new rules for combat air patrol, air and naval bases, Japanese destroyers acting as 1 infantry transports and allowed shore bombardment, along with the two-hit battleship, are all welcome additions, as are the USA marine units and kamikaze rules.The quality of the pieces and board are there.NEUTRAL: The only player who can build new factories in this version is USA, which kind of sucks, but also makes the game more challenging.The game takes forever to set up and break down, but that's the way this series has always been, so it's no surprise here. Expect half an hour of set up time, with an average play time of eight to twelve hours or more if you want to go to the bitter end. (Note: In my test game, the Japanese player conceded after five-and-a-half hours [about four or five rounds]. I would say most of the fun we had was from socializing rather than playing the game. It was a 3-player game with two experienced Axis & Allies players as Japan and India/Australia, with a war game newbie playing China/USA).This game is worth playing once if you're an Axis & Allies fan, but seems pointless to own. I can't see it ever hitting the table more than that. It completely lacks the magic and fun of the original game and the Europe edition.There is a new second edition of Pacific available that hopefully corrects some of these flaws, but I haven't played it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARL3670R4YXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005EBA6#wasThisHelpful","R2ARL3670R4YXW","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hilariously creepy nutcracker box screams, ""Buy me!"" Unfortunately, what's inside is basically just glorified trail mix without the raisins, not the amazing sense of ""Wow!"" proclaimed on the box. It's an OK product, but super-crunchy and a bit too salty and not chocolaty enough for me. The size and contents of the snack clusters varies wildly and that means you may get zero chocolate, or only a single chip per snack cluster. In my opinion, they need to up the chocolate ratio slightly (by at least +10%), because when I see the word ""chocolate"" on the box I expect to get some in every bite. Adding raisins could also help the sweetness factor.Snacklemouth was certainly cheap enough at my local food coop to take a chance on it, but I won't be buying it again. That being said, if you're a trail mix fan (I'm generally not) and your taste runs more toward salty than sweet, by all means, give this a try.WARNING: The box, while fun for adults, may frighten or disturb small children.

"Tried a two-player game and one player got all the best good cards and best bad cards to play on me. Could never catch up or hurt her flamingo production enough to make a difference. The problem with having flamingos as the scoring mechanic means the game will end suddenly and clearly, with no chance for anyone else to steal the victory from whoever is in the lead. This sucks. Also problematic in the two-player version is there are way too many trailers, so your park never gets more than half-rented to residents even if you make an effort to fill it. The rules are vague and poorly written. Too many of the cards are too complicated to remember.  The trailer cards use actual photos of real trailers and are amusing to look at, but the residents and other cards use goofy, bad art which is distracting. Not much else I can say about this game except it isn't much better with 3 or more players. It's not horrible (so I'll rate it two stars instead of one), but there are way better games out there like Ticket To Ride, Dominion, Stone Age, etc., and I certainly have no interest in playing Trailer Park Wars again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1276IGJYF4LZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CWMVC0#wasThisHelpful","R1276IGJYF4LZR","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best rice cakes on the market. They're non-GMO, with no cholesterol, no gluten, no fat, no sugar--just lightly salted whole grain brown rice. They are just salty enough to impart a pleasant flavor without going overboard. The square shape is fun, and I like how they are thinner than regular rice cakes, yet extremely sturdy. They don't fall apart and sprinkle crumbs everywhere like other cakes. Not that they don't crumble a bit here and there, but there's no wholesale crumbling or breaking in half even with heavy knife pressure while spreading peanut butter, etc., and the few crumbs are small. My only complaint is I wish they came in resealable packaging.You get 27 cakes per package. A serving size of 3 cakes contain 54 calories and 30g of sodium, 12g of carbs, 1g dietary fiber, and 1g of protein.Note: This product is manufactured in Belgium in a facility that also produces products that contain wheat, milk, sesame seeds, and soy. I require a gluten, dairy, and soy-free diet and had no problem eating them. Those with basic intolerance to any or all these ingredients should be fine, but those with celiac disease or other extreme food allergies may want to exercise their standard level of caution or email the company to find out what the facility's cleaning process between different product batches is.Another quality, good-tasting gluten-free brown rice cake is Lundberg Eco-Farmed Brown Rice Cake, Lightly Salted, 8.5-Ounce Units  (Pack of 12), but they are the standard size thick disks, seem a bit heavier on the salt, and are much more prone to crumbling than these.

"My kitten had IBS: chronic diarrhea and loose stool even after being dewormed, so it was a food allergy issue. I tried vet-only sensitive stomach dry food (too expensive, didn't help much), then Science Diet Sensitive Stomach dry food (cheaper), and began supplementing her diet with organic canned pumpkin to help with fiber intake. The organic pumpkin helped a lot more than the Science Diet seemed to, but the kitten still had issues. I switched to Blue Basics Sensitive Stomach and haven't had any real problems since. I kept up the pumpkin for awhile, but she is doing fine without it now, just eating Basics. It really is a miracle food. No grain, no proteins except turkey and potatoes. As someone with multiple food allergies, I know how important it is to eat the right things and what happens when I don't--I was able to solve my IBS/food allergy issues by radically changing my diet, so I knew it would work for my kitten if I could just find the right food. Blue Basics is the best on the market.IMPORTANT: Note that the other Blue Basics formulas are NOT grain-free (at least at the time I'm writing this review) and use different proteins. I tried one when my local pet store was out of this type, and my kitten instantly got diarrhea, so I switched back and she was fine again. Also, please be aware that many cats are allergic to poultry (such as chicken!) and turkey is NOT poultry, but its own type of meat altogether. That's what makes it an ideal protein.UPDATE: Bad news: As of June 2015, Blue Buffalo has discontinued this food without notice, leaving customers like me in a lurch. Good news: The first food I switched to NULO NUL DRY GF CAT DUCK 12# (Duck and Lentils recipe), was a perfect replacement for the old Blue Buffalo. It's been several weeks now and my cat hasn't had diarrhea once after the switch. I also think it's even higher quality food.UPDATE: September 27, 2015: It's been four months now since I switched to Nulo Dry Grain-Free Cat Duck Food, 5 lb and my cat's diarrhea has gone from about once a month on Blue Buffalo Sensitive Stomach to NEVER. Hooray! And the Nulo has chicken in it! My vet had previously suggested she had a chicken allergy, but I'm no longer convinced that's the case. Anyway, she loves the Nulo even more than the Blue Buffalo, and it's a super-premium, healthy food on top of stopping her diarrhea. Win-win!If you need a different choice, try Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach & Skin Dry Cat Food - 15.5 -Pound Bag. It worked about as well as the old Blue Buffalo, but was not foolproof like the Nulo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU92IUZJ5HQ3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084FNW3K#wasThisHelpful","RU92IUZJ5HQ3E","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't understand the bad review. The box I got, the cookies were in perfect condition and never fell apart, but I bought mine at a local store. Maybe the other reviewer's cookies (bought online) were damaged in shipping? The cookies were expensive, yes, but delicious. Plus, they are dense and you probably won't want to eat more than one or two at a time (you get 10 per box). They taste like ""real"" cookies, not gluten-free. Salty, sweet, and crunchy. Would buy again, but any seller charging more than six bucks a box is overcharging!

"Some of my gaming buddies are all hyped up about the BSG board game. They have a bunch of expansions and have been trying to get me to play it for years. OK, so I finally got suckered into it. And I was underwhelmed. It was OK--not great, and kind of boring. I am not a fan of SyFy's BSG series (preferring the 70s version I grew up on), nor do I tend to enjoy cooperative games or backstabbing games, so there was pretty much zero chance I was going to love this game. However, I did not hate it, or dislike it enough to say I'd never play it again, so three stars is fair.The problem was for the first half of our six player game, nobody was a Cylon traitor, so nothing exciting happened. Everything was way too easy. The game improved somewhat afterward, when two of us became Cylons, including me, but before I could do anything, the other Cylon, not realizing I was on his side, had me executed, then got executed himself! LOL. Even though we were both resurrected, I hardly got to do anything fun as a Cylon, but at least we were able to make the humans run out of fuel, so we won the game.Other things I didn't like were the constant voting, and trying to decide what to do on my turns (I was the Admiral, by the way). There were too many cards, too many choices, or in the case of some players like the pilots, no choice at all. Most players turns took too long, including mine. The game lasted about three hours, which my friends told me was rather short for this game! Things I liked were the cool spaceship miniatures, and overall production value of the boards and misc. components. As for the rules . . . whatever. They're OK, but a bit complicated for my taste.Note that we played with more than just the base game, including the Battlestar Galactica The Board Game: Pegasus Expansion, and maybe a few others, but I'm not sure which. These added cool Cylon basestar miniatures (the base game came with dumb tokens), and more options for the Colonials and Cylons, and these seem like a good value if you are a fan of the game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI1WO42SRUEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589944607#wasThisHelpful","RI1WO42SRUEG","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Other reviews can tell you about the bone-chilling plot, etc., but I wanted to specifically recommend you get the unabridged audio book version. It is amazing, simply flawless, and the actress who performs it is absolutely spot-on. She captures the voice of 13-year-old ""Alice"" perfectly.Although not technically listed as YA, Megan Abbott's The End of Everything: A Novel tells a similarly haunting, twisted story, only from the perspective of a 13-year-old girl who is coping with the abduction of her best friend.

"This is the absolute best cat litter I've ever used and would never, ever, go back to using any other. I used mostly Arm & Hammer Double Duty Clumping Litter, 20-Pounds before, but the cats spread it everywhere (making a mess), and it didn't do a good job at odor controlling either urine or feces. Plus, it wasn't even that great at clumping--at least not without wasting a bunch of litter. This new walnut-based litter from Blue Buffalo eliminates both urine and feces odors much better, it cleans up easily when changing out the box, the cats don't track it everywhere, and best of all, it clumps perfectly without using too much litter--which means it lasts significantly longer than any other brand, easily 2 or 3 times as long. Yes, sometimes my cats do get their white paws dusty brown after using it, but that's no different than the gray dust they got from other litters. I've never found particles of it stuck under their paws like my old litter. However, this litter does track about as easily as any other, but I don't use a mat, so your experience may differ there.The negative reviews are dead wrong!

"Enjoyed this bread mix very much. It rose and produced a nice crust. Inside was soft and chewy. We added rosemary, garlic powder, honey, and molasses. I think the molasses might have made it too moist and it took an extra five minutes to bake before quickly achieving the ""perfect"" temperature of 206 degrees. Will leave out the molasses next time to see if that helps. Despite that, this tasted almost exactly like ""real"" bread, though I would only eat it hot with butter, and with honey or jam. The texture and flavor are nice, but it's a bit dense and not what I'd call sandwich bread. It's great as a side dish or appetizer for a meal.My favorite gluten-free presliced sandwich bread is Food 4 Life's Multigrain (in the frozen section), but it's over eight bucks a loaf and you have to toast it to make it taste good. Once you do, it's amazing.If you are in Western Washington, you should check out Olivia Super Free breads and desserts (from the same people that own Wheatless in Seattle). They make amazing pizza crusts, sourdough boules, brownies, cupcakes, french mini-baguettes, hamburger buns, and a variety of sandwich breads--there's an even longer list of products on their site, but I can't find them in stores). Also, there is 8 Arms Gluten-Free Bakery in Olympia, WA, that make jalapeno cheese bread, rosemary + kalamata olive loaves, chia-millet bread, and ""sunshine"" bread. For good gluten-free desserts in Olympia, I recommend Pockets Full of Pies (cinnamon rolls, cupcakes, donuts, and pies).

"I did not like Thebes my first time playing it, and have little desire to play it again. Even my friends, who own it, say it's a game they only enjoyed their first few times out of the box--it got old fast and now they want to sell it. The artwork is bland, though the boards 'n' bits are durable with cute Indian Jones meeples and cloth bags for each of the five dig sites. Although the first part of the game is all strategy getting the knowledge you need to get the most treasures from the digs, when you actually go there, it becomes a ridiculous luck-fest as you try to blind-draw variable value treasure tokens from a cloth bag that is also loaded with zero-point sand tokens. You could literally draw nothing but sand and waste a ton of time for nothing. Not much fun there!I can't recommend this game and have no idea how it got such great reviews. The game drags on and on and there were many turns where none of us could do anything except inch the game toward completion by moving one space and doing nothing, hoping the cards would change by the time our next turn rolled around.

"This is a super-fun collection of horror stories, from the gross-out to comedy, covering vampires, aliens, zombies, cannibals, ghosts, psychos, and all sorts of things that go bump in the night. Not all the stories are great, but most are at least decent to downright fantastic. While these may be fine on paper, I heard the audio book version and Macleod Andrews (the actor who reads them) is amazing! He does all kinds of different voices and accents perfectly, especially the moronic rednecks that populate a lot of these stories. They're all brought to life so brilliantly that I can't imagine imagine anyone else ever reading these stories half as good.As for the stories themselves, by far and away the best ones are the two vampire stories: ""The Screaming"" and ""Trailer Sucks."" These will stick with you in a way few other vampire stories can, and both for completely different reasons. ""The Screaming"" is a (relatively) classy homage to Dracula, while ""Trailer Sucks"" is a full-tilt redneck sleaze-fest that still manages to add a new twist to being a vampire--one which I won't reveal here.If you're a horror fan--especially of the gross-out kind who loves EC Comics/Tales from the Crypt style twist endings--there's a lot to like in this collection. What keeps it from being a five star collection are the stupid, not funny comedy stories (at least five or six, and which take up most of disks 6 and 7). Things like were-squirrels, were-canaries, radioactive monkeys, etc. I would have much rather seen these stories put into a separate anthology--one I could have avoided.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRDJQGZCO5IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AOA6BG#wasThisHelpful","R1VRDJQGZCO5IM","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The plot: 12 teenagers in high school join a Satanic cult led by a fellow student (also a Neo-Nazi) who convinces them to kill themselves so he can steal their power to become a great wizard. Only it doesn't work and the cult members come back as evil ghosts with some kind of power to hypnotize other students into killing themselves. So then instead of having the central heroine be a student (which would make the most sense), instead we get Tess, a stupid lady art teacher, who starts a romance with the hunky gym teacher. That's the ""A"" plot. Lame! The ""B"" plot involves one of the dead girls' unpopular sister moping around and dealing with her parents and joining the Nazi Satan cult. Then the ""C"" plot is the Nazi Satan kid trying to form a new cult so he can get them to kill themselves ""correctly"" this time so he can steal their power. Hardly any time is spent with the cult leader or ghosts' POV. Just a lot of boring, badly written nonsense with people hearing spooky sounds and seeing shadows, or a crazy mom taking her dead daughter's books to school thinking she's still alive. This has ""Lifetime Movie of the Week"" written all over it, and that's not a compliment.Oh yeah, and the cult leader is named after a Ninja Turtle, which the gym teacher makes a joke about a hundred pages in. That might have been a timely pop culture reference back in 1994 when this dreck was written, but it's still a bad idea to name your villain ""Donatello"" after a famous cartoon character... or an Italian painter.The writing is awful, so bad you can skip tons of pages and not miss a thing. I ended up skipping over a bunch of the ""A"" plot with the boring teacher because nothing interesting ever happened. While hardly brilliant or original, the ""B"" plot with the high school girl moved at a much better pace and was the only reason I was able to finish reading this mess. The book is loaded with unnecessary ""who cares"" details, clunky big words (like ""adamant"" and ""inverse proportions""), awkward sentence construction, run-on sentences, and stilted, unrealistic dialogue that info-dumps all over the place, plus a lot of telling us how characters feel instead of showing us. The cover art is kind of cool, and the basic premise had promise, but in the untalented hands of ""Abigail McDaniels"" (aka Dan and Lynda Trent, according to the copyright notice), none of it matters. The Uprising is not scary, not clever, not sexy, not anything really but a time waster typical of the hack fiction factory at Zebra Books. Yes, that Zebra Books--the Kensington imprint who are guilty of churning out more bad horror novels than any other publisher on the planet (except maybe Leisure/Dorchester).Here's an example of the dull, phoning it in crap writing from p.119: ""Knowing it would be at least seven that evening before the first of her volunteers returned to school [to help her paint scenery for the school play], Tess treated herself to a leisurely meal at Paulson's Family Restaurant. The food was good, the service adequate, and even though she preferred company when dining out, the break from routine was enjoyable. Or at least that was what she told herself."" Yawn. Why do I care where Tess ate or how well her dinner went? It does nothing to advance the plot or inform me of anything useful about Tess. Pretty much everyone prefers company when dining out. That's kind of the whole point, right?And check out this excerpt of awfulness from p.121 after Tess gets to school: ""As she progressed toward the stage, her pace diminishing in inverse proportion to the increasing darkness, she tried to remember where Janis had told her the stage light control panel was located. Janis had been adamant that the replacement bulbs were too expensive to use for scenery building. Instead, she was to use the smaller ones that were recessed into the ceiling above the stage. Unconsciously trying to repel the fear-provoking sensations that threatened to seize her, she tried to recall whether the front of the stage was upstage or downstage. Drama had never been her best subject."" What a bunch of nonsense! None of that information is important. The whole book is written in this plodding, amateur style. I can't believe it was published. Oh wait--it's Zebra Books, so yes, I can. The only thing missing are the blood-dripping skeletons their other terrible horror novel covers are (in)famous for. Want to see some? Check out Runaway and Wait and See.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ICCIQZ06ZQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0821745018#wasThisHelpful","R7ICCIQZ06ZQN","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from ""analysis paralysis"" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPCXZGZAW6YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786964502#wasThisHelpful","RCPCXZGZAW6YZ","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently watched a bunch of professional game reviewers gush all over the internet about how great Trains is. They said incredible things like ""the best game of the year,"" and ""you can throw away your Dominion sets now!"" I was really hoping this game wasn't overhyped. Well, let me tell you, it's not! I just played my first two games of Trains and it manages to out-Dominion Dominion, with a touch of Power Grid and Ticket To Ride thrown in for good measure. Players take on the roles of competing 21st century Japanese rail barons. You get a starting hand of 10 cards (7 coins, 2 lay rails, and 1 station expander). Pretty much just like Dominion. You draw five cards, then play your actions and/or buy new cards. Unlike Dominion, you can buy as many cards as you can afford, and take as many actions as you're able, which is a welcome relief from Dominions restrictive 1 action, 1 buy mechanic. There are 8 decks of different cards (bigger money, additional lay rails, additional station expanders, victory point cards, and waste, which are filler cards that you get for laying rails and building stations. Then there are eight randomly determined cards to mix it up and make each new game different. Again, all this sounds very much like Dominion. Where it rapidly starts to diverge is by providing a double-sided hex grid map board of Tokyo and Osaka. Whenever you lay rails, you place a cube of your player color on a hex. If that hex contains a city, another player, a station, a remote location, and/or difficult terrain, you must pay extra money to build there. Although you can't block your opponents, you can make it very expensive for them to move in and through your territory. Stations in cities score victory points as do remote locations. Different cities can support different numbers of stations (1-3). Although it's possible to win by ignoring the board and concentrating solely on deck management, it's just as possible to win by ignoring deck management and going crazy on the map. Most players will strive for a mix, as it really is more fun to engage on the map while still trying to maximize deck efficiency.The game is for 2-4 players, ages 12 and up, and takes about  45 minutes to an hour or so to complete a game. The game ends when any 4 card decks get bought out, or when all the stations have ben placed, or when a player runs out of all their wooden cubes (each player has 20). Most of the points will be tallied at the end, but some cards may let you score in-game. There are a lot of cards here (many reminiscent of ones seen in Dominion), and randomizers are included and clearly marked on the card face (unlike Dominion). A larger file card is included to help sort the cards in a Rolodex-style fashion (the bottom of the plastic tray insert is corrugated to allow for card traction). The box comes with a bunch of foam pads that can be removed later to help store future card expansions. The rule book is 12 pages (including a reference sheet on the back cover), but with a lot of white space, large font size, and pictures, so it's really not all that hard to learn. If you know Dominion, you already know 80% of how to play Trains.The production values are high, the cards are thick and have a nice sheen to them with lots of nice, photo-realistic illustrations of railroad life, and everything seems durable and well put-together.My only real complaints are:1) I wish the game used little plastic bullet trains instead of wooden cubes (and the blue player color is super dark and easy to get lost on the maps).2) The ""mountain"" hexes look like forests. Seriously, the picture is just a bunch of trees, no mountain visible. Get a clue, designers and artists! If you call something a ""mountain,"" it better look like one.3) The maps look rather amateur, just like they did in the original Japanese limited edition. How hard would it have been to have a better artist make the maps look super cool? At least the scoring track around the board is nice, with plenty of room for scoring markers to share the same space.4) The game goes a bit too heavy on the icons, so many cards have zero text, just symbols you have to memorize (there aren't very many, but it is annoying at first).5) Some cards provide BOTH action(s) and money, but they aren't readily apparent because they are color-coded red (action) not blue (money), and the designers screwed up by not making such cards coded red AND blue (like Dominion does for treasure/victory combo cards) so they are easy to tell apart. Also, a money card (""Tourist Train"") also scores you one in-game victory point each time you play it, but it looks too much like the regular money train cards and it's easy to forget to score it as a result.6) The ""Tourist Train"" card may be overpowered according to some players. I ignored it the first game and bought none while my opponent had 3--I lost on a tie. In the next game, I bought 4 of them early and often (my opponent bought 3 of them but not until at least mid-game) and I easily won, scoring off the chart. So if this card is available to buy in the game, you have to buy some and do it fast or you might be guaranteeing yourself a loss no matter what happens on the board. The safest thing to do if Tourist Train is OP is just not to use it.7) There are multiple cards that discard cards or trash waste, but only one card that trashes money, and one card that trashes itself for money. There are a fair number of boring, underpowered action cards and expensive rail laying cards that negate some situational penalties, but the latter are nearly worthless in a 2p game. Some of these cards suck and will never get used. Although that leaves a fair number of interesting, fun, and decent cards to choose from, the game is screaming for more variety and better cards, including a card like ""Chapel"" in Dominion that lets you trash multiple cards of whatever you want.8) The game needs bigger money and victory point cards like the Platinum and Colonies from Dominion Dominion: Prosperity. None of the victory point cards are as good as in Dominion but (mostly) cost the same--this seems intentional, however, as you cannot ignore the board in favor of a strategy of buying victory point cards alone--you will lose this way, so that's a good thing, but I'd like to see one more Victory Point card comparable to Colony. And the money-trashing card, ""Temporary Timetable,"" becomes a deck clogger once you upgrade most of your money cards and/or one of the bigger money card stacks runs out and you have nothing to upgrade to.I know these sound like a lot of things are wrong with the game, but they are small enough--and the rest of the game is awesome enough--that I can still highly recommend it. Trains isn't perfect, but it is a great game. The theme is tightly integrated (unlike Dominion's loosely medieval-inspired nonsense), and frankly, Trains feels more like I'm building a railroad than Ticket to Ride ever did. It's also easier to learn and a lot more fun than Power Grid, with way more variety. This is a better game than Dominion without much added complexity. In fact, it's the added complexity and challenge of the maps that helps make it so much better. Once Trains gets a few card and map expansions under its belt, I doubt Dominion will ever hit the table again with my group.By the way, if you can't wait for the official expansions, you can get some free promo maps online at Board Game Geek. Maps so far include GenCon (Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area), Northeastern USA, China, Germany, Nagoya (Japan), and Poland. Also, you can find rules for running Trains as a 5 player game there. Basically, you deal everyone their usual starting hand of 10 except they get 1 less normal Train (Money) and 1 Landfill (trash Waste) card instead, then add two random extra card stacks to buy from, and the game end changes to when any 5 stacks run out, or all stations are built, or all rail (cubes) have been laid. You'll need to add 21 tiny wooden cubes from another game you own in a color that is not red, green, blue, or yellow for the 5th player (one is a score marker, the rest are rail tokens).UPDATE #1: Played 8 two-player games now and still absolutely loving it (though I discovered a few more nitpicks I've added to my original review). I can tell games with 3 or more players are going to be tough and brutal, hotly contested affairs and can't wait to try some!UPDATE #2: Finally have a 3 and 4 player game under my belt, and it does radically change things. The maps become infinitely tighter with lots of interplayer conflict (or at least the potential for it), and card stacks, stations, and cubes run out much faster. I love 2p Trains, but 3 and 4 are even more fun (but lower scoring). You pretty much have to build into opponent-held cities to win. 3 of the 4 new players loved it (the other wasn't sure yet, but he lost badly). All were experienced Dominion players. 2 of them thought it wasn't quite as good as Dominion (at least not yet), and 2 of them thought it was already better. Everyone agreed it needs more maps and cards, but I'm sure those are in the works. I've played all the cards and 3-4 player games now, so the only thing left to try is the unofficial 5 player rules. Will post my results as soon as I can put a 5p game together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9ZOLHDY2ZLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3FHVQE#wasThisHelpful","R1P9ZOLHDY2ZLR","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You take on the roles of greedy Indian merchants trying to outdo each other to become the Maharajah's personal trader. This is a light, simple to learn 2-player resource trading game that you can teach in five minutes and be done with in twenty. And yet the game is fantastically balanced and requires careful thought, planning, and strategy. Most games are just a few points apart. You can try it for free online at Board Game Arena. Once you try it, you'll be hooked. This will be a game you'll be playing for years, great for couples, and great for quick filler between other games (I also recommend Guillotine for that, which works for 2-5 players). The artwork, box, and components are all beautiful and durable. Best of all, the cards are pre-shuffled and the pogs are pre-punched and pre-sorted! Everything is ready to play right out of the box. Zero effort required. Nice!I found some rules to increase the number of players to 3 or 4 over at Jaipur's page on Boardgame Geek.For 3 Players: Deal out 4 cards, hand limit 6. Game ends with 4 coin colors depleted. No end for cards, just shuffle the discard pile when needed.For 4 Players: Deal out 3 cards, hand limit 5. Game ends with only 1 coin colors remaining.

"OK, after the epic literary disaster that was The Libertines, Episode One, Max's writing is clearly a bit better this time out. There are less typos, better and more varied sentence construction. However, his writing skills still leave plenty to be desired. Word repetition is rampant. For example, in chapter one, I counted three uses of the word ""committed"" or ""committing"" on the first page alone, real close to each other. Big no-no. Also, Max uses the hero's name, Connor, way too much. Connor said this, Connor did that. Dude, we know it's frickin' Connor, because you just told us it was him fifty million times already! Try and use the word ""he"" instead. First establish it's Connor, then switch to the ""he"" pronoun for a bit before switching back to the hero's name again. Also, it's bad if too many paragraphs too close together begin with the same word or name--in this case, ""Connor.""Max is still faking a bunch of 5-star reviews to make himself look like a better author than he is, and using fake profiles to attack people who post negative reviews. Seriously, man. Stop. If you put half as much energy into improving your writing as you do into pimping yourself, you will EARN some real positive reviews that will make you feel like a king.

It's got a decent standard energy drink flavor that's pleasant but nothing special (it tastes like a smoother, lighter Rock Star). The real star of the drink is not the taste but that it's made with pure cane sugar (not nasty high fructose corn syrup). It offers a good mix of vitamins and other energy-boosting stuff without a crazy amount of caffeine. I never get too wired or have a sugar crash after drinking it (though I never try to drink the whole can at once, so your experience may vary).So what's the verdict? I may not love Whoopass, but I certainly like it enough to make it my new energy drink of choice--at least until I can find an even healthier, organic one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCQ8CU5TFHYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071279ZO#wasThisHelpful","RRCQ8CU5TFHYI","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lords of Waterdeep is a fantastic light worker placement game, and along with Stone Age Board Game, the perfect gateway game for non-gamers. Experienced gamers will likely also love it. It is so elegantly designed, so easy to teach and remember, yet difficult to master, that it is a classic of its kind, right up there with other great gateway games like Ticket To Ride, Guillotine, Stone Age, and Dominion. The quality of the components is excellent with (mostly) nice art throughout. The board is easy to understand and only rarely runs out of room for new buildings (10 slots are provided, but there is room in the center of the board to fit a few more in). Sure, the D&D theme feels slightly pasted on, but the mechanics are sound and it's a hell of a lot of fun, with excellent replay value.At the beginning of the game, each player gets dealt a secret Lord card, representing which of the secret lords of the city they are playing. Each lord prefers two different types of quests and gives a 4 point end-game victory point bonus for completing quests of those types (no two lords prefer both the same quests, though many overlap with one). There is one exception, a lord who gives no quest bonus, but instead a 6 point bonus for each building you control at the end. This lord is harder to win with in games with more than 2 players, but in my experience, can be almost impossible to beat it in a 2-player game. You also get dealt two random quest and intrigue cards, which I'll explain below. Intrigue cards are kept secret until played, but quest cards are public knowledge and kept face-up until completed.You get a number of meeples (""your lord's agents"") who are placed one at a time in turn order until everyone has assigned all theirs. On the 5th round, everyone gets a bonus meeple. Most places, only one person can get the space's offering that turn. Two of the spaces allow up to three meeples to be assigned (including multiple of the same player's meeples). These are for gaining new quests or playing intrigue cards. Intrigue cards let you get a bonus, or mess with another player, or give everyone a bonus (but the person who played the card gets the best). The Builder's Hall space lets you choose from three different buildings to buy. Buildings offer cubes or money or intrigue cards beyond and better than the spaces on the board. They cost 4-8 money each. When you buy one, it is instantly available for use by all players. Whoever assigns their meple to the building space gets its offerings, but the owner of the building gets a reward too, which is usually a lesser version of the building's offering, but some offer in-game victory points. So you want to buy buildings and hope other players use them. If you use your own building, you don't get the owner reward, just whatever anyone would get for using it. All the other spaces give money or one or two of a specific color cube (""adventurer for hire"").You usually score in-game victory points by completing quests, of which there are five types: Warfare, Piety, Skullduggery, Commerce, and Arcana. Each requires a variety of colored cubes and/or money to complete, and the type of quest determines the bulk of the cubes and/or money it requires. White cubes are clerics (Piety), Purple cubes are wizards (Arcana), black cubes are thieves (Skullduggery), and orange cubes are fighters (warfare). Commerce quests all require money to complete in addition to a mix of cubes. Some quests offer an ongoing bonus power but are worth less (these are called Plot Quests and clearly marked on the quest card). However, most just give you an immediate victory point bonus and/or some other cool thing, such as bonus cubes or money. One even gives you an extra, special colored meeple, but is worth no points and is a pain to complete. Get it early enough, and you can have a huge advantage. Get it or complete it late and not only will it not be of much help, but will likely cost you the game if you waste resources on it that could be better spent collecting other quests that hand out victory points.The game lasts eight rounds. Each round, all the spaces you can place your meeples on refresh with whatever goods they are offering (money, buildings, intrigue cards, etc.). There is also a space for getting the first player token. There are always four face-up quests available, but if you don't want any of those, you can choose to discard them all in favor of four new ones, but then you're stuck with keeping one of whatever new ones come out. There is no penalty for uncompleted quests at the end of the game.My only real complaint is with the box itself. The way it is designed is arty-farty with a dumb extra ""fake"" bottom that can't be removed and exists just to look cool, so don't put any weight on it, as that bends/crushes the box easily, which is not acceptable, especially for a game that costs this much. And, due to the stupid design of the bottom, you can't put the top lid over it. It won't fit. The plastic insert tray holds everything separate and mostly snug (but way too snug in the case of the money and jewel tokens which are an absolute nightmare to put back in). As seemingly snug as things may appear, however, I wouldn't go turning the box upside-down if I were you. Also, after owning the game for a month, the inside bottom part of the box is split on two corners! Do you know how many game boxes have done that to me? Zero, at least in the time frame I'm talking about here. Normally, it takes years, possibly decades, for a box to fall apart, but not this one. In my opinion, this is the worst-designed game box in board game history, and the plastic insert tray is no prize, either. All the other components (cubes, cards, meeples, etc.) are solid and durable, however.The new Lords of Waterdeep Expansion: Scoundrels of Skullport (D&D Boxed Game) is due out August 20, 2013, and the rules are available to preview now as a free PDF on the Wizards of the Coast site. This double expansion contains two new add-on maps (one for the evil underground town of Skullport, one for the infamous dungeon of Undermountain). There are a ton of new buildings, new quests, new intrigue cards, six new Lords (including the beholder crime lord, Xanathar), a new resource called Corruption (and an associated Corruption Track board), as well as optional rules, important rules clarifications and errata for the base game, and a set of gray meeples to add a sixth player. It also includes an extra meeple in each of the original player colors for longer games, which are mandatory when adding a sixth player and optional otherwise. So a two-player game would have you begin with five meeples, then add a sixth one on round five. This expansion--the first of what will hopefully be many--adds a ton of replayability and new ways to strategize and win. After reading the rules, it looks like a must-own.Note that a guy in Canada is selling custom, laser-cut, painted ""DnDeeples"" (search for them using that term). For hardcore lovers of Lords, these can replace the cubes with meeple-looking clerics holding maces, dual-dagger wielding thieves, wizards with staff and pointy hat, and viking helmeted fighters with a sword!

"These are generic ""who cares?"" meeples and a waste of money. In what way do these represent adventurers better than the cubes that come with the game? Also note that although these are being listed as ""Lords of Waterdeep Mini Meeples,"" they are in no way official or endorsed by Wizards of the Coast for their game. I'm no entertainment lawyer, but this sounds like trademark infringement to me. They should probably be re-listed as ""Mini Meeple 100 piece set, suitable for use with Lords of Waterdeep"" not made to sound like they are a Wizards of the Coast product.A guy in Canada is selling custom, laser-cut, painted ""DnDeeples"" (search for them using that term).

"I grew up in the 70s and 80s playing D&D like the author, but had a completely different, positive experience gaming. The author clearly hates himself, his life, and blames D&D for everything when he is the problem--and the other jerks he gamed with. Throughout the book, he constantly bashes D&D and gamers, and paints himself as a completely obnoxious, unlikable twit. Yes, this is occasionally hilarious, but gets old quick. There is no real character arc here. He just goes from being a geeky loser to a regular loser and never redeems himself, just gives up gaming practically overnight. He says bullies were right to assault him on the street and throw him in the fountain because he was wearing his elf cloak in public. Not only that, but he aspires to be like them and bully others, including his readers. He ditches his best friend for a sadistic idiot and then, when he sees his ex-friend twenty-five years later, calls him fat and a failure and explains how his ex-friend might've turned out better and done less drugs if he'd kept hanging out with the author. He also blasts the poor guy for turning religious and equates that to trading one fictional fantasy kingdom for another. The author then goes on to state how anyone who plays D&D is sick, delusional, obsessed, and addicted, and should promptly trade in their books and dice for what amounts to a bow tie and a 9-5 at an accounting firm or else they are wasting their lives. The message of the book is totally anti-gaming, anti-imagination, pro-bullying, and pro-conformity. You can tell by the author photo on the back flap of the hardcover that there's something wrong with Mark Barrowcliffe. His smile isn't so much a smile as a sneer, and his eyes are cold and dead inside. The photo is creepy, and that's what I thought before I read what a vile person he is in the book.The fact is, outside *maybe* a few people in the UK, nobody knows who Mark Barrowcliffe is or cares. The only reason anyone picks this book up is to read about a fellow gamer growing up in a similar time period and hopefully recounting similar experiences in an amusing way. What we get instead is to be kicked in the teeth and insulted page after page, with far too little about D&D and far too much about the rest of his stupid, boring life and racist, fascist friends. As such, the book is, in the parlance of today's youth, ""an epic fail."" Another annoying part is the frequently impossible to understand British slang. These stop American readers dead in their tracks to scratch their heads and go, ""Huh? What the hell does he mean by that?"" The one mildly interesting thing I did learn from the slang is that British gamers don't ""roll"" dice. They ""shake"" them. LOL. Wish that had been on page one so I could have chucked the rest of the book in the trash.Shame on the author and his publisher for tricking people into thinking this was a pro-gaming book, but who would buy it knowing it was actually a hate-fueled journey into an angry jerk's mind?","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16U5HG7B3VSP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569476012#wasThisHelpful","R16U5HG7B3VSP4","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally released by Rio Grande Games, Zman Games has licensed the game and put it back into print as of May 1, 2013. I talked to ZMan Games and a rep there assured me the only changes are some minor rules clarifications (not new rules). All the original high quality components (including the leather dice cup) from the Rio Grande version are going to be included.Stone Age is an awesome, amazing game that only takes a few minutes to learn, but is challenging to win, with multiple winning strategies. Suitable for experienced gamers and the whole family. It takes about an hour to play, maybe 90 minutes. This is a great gateway game and introduction to the worker placement games popular in Europe. Can't say enough good things about it. It scales well regardless of the number of players. Never gets old. A true modern gaming classic right up there with Dominion: Big Box and Ticket To Ride.I also recommend the super-fun expansion, Stone Age Style is The Goal, which lets you add a fifth player, plus new huts, new cards, a new resource, and a new village location with its own trade track that lets you convert your existing resources into the ones you need.Another awesome light worker placement game that's like this one but with a fantasy theme is Lords of Waterdeep: A Dungeons & Dragons Board Game, but it does feature some ""take that!"" screwing your opponents over mechanics.For a game without that, I highly recommend Hawaii, which has a lush, tropical theme. Hawaii is slightly more complex (at least initially), but offers more variety. The board is modular and where each location goes is randomly determined at setup. Plus, the price of everything changes each round, ensuring you also get a different experience in-play, not just at set-up.NOTE: You can try both Stone Age and Hawaii out for free online against real opponents at Board Game Arena (live) or Yucata (remote).

"This is a useful book any writer will find helpful. It's got you covered no matter what market you're trying to crack, from nonfiction to fiction (including screenplays, magazines, poetry, etc.). Written and electronic submissions are covered. Samples include a ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" version for side-by-side comparison with the reasons why each works or doesn't clearly pointed out. Most of the information you need to know how to properly and professionally submit your writing to any market is here, spelled out clearly and concisely.There are a few problems however:1) There is absolutely NO information on how to pitch an anthology or series! With more and more publishers wanting to establish franchises like Harry Potter, Twilight, Divergent, and the Hunger Games, this is a major oversight that needs to be addressed in future editions.2) I would have liked to see a few extra sample pages for the ""correct"" novel outline that encompassed a complete chapter rather than just the first page. As presented, it says to write ""chapter-by-chapter outline"" on each page of your outline, but is this really necessary if a chapter description requires an extra page? Which many easily could, because of the 1"" margins, double-spacing, and line breaks! This is not made clear.3) Furthermore, there is not enough advice on the best way to write a synopsis, which is your novel's most important marketing tool to agents and publishers. I had to search all over the web to piece together the necessary advice when this should have been provided in the book.4) There were not that many ""exclusive tips"" from leading agents and editors as promised on the cover, and they were all pretty much just common sense advice, nothing earth-shattering.5) Lastly, I would imagine many writers are only interested in writing for one or two of the markets presented, making large chunks of the book wasted space for them.Verdict: I bought my copy used knowing I would never need most of the info in this book and am happy with my purchase, save for the criticism above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7C0VLOXHF00C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158297571X#wasThisHelpful","R7C0VLOXHF00C","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dominion Guilds is the final expansion and the best of the three ""small box"" sets (Dominion: Cornucopia and Dominion: Alchemy are the other two). The gimmick this time is cards that grant you bankable money tokens or allow you to ""overpay"" for the cards in order to get an immediate bonus when you buy them. There are 13 cards and 5 blanks included along with the rules and a small bag of metal coin tokens (identical to the ones that come in Dominion Seaside). There's a great mix of cards that can really change the game, some more complicated than others. Not all the cards are standouts, a few being overly complicated or hard to use like Butcher and Doctor, but that's true of all sets. My only major complaint is the rules only include three sample card setups for the Dominion base set and three for Dominion Intrigue. There's nothing about the best setups using the other expansions. Of the included setups, all the ones with the base game were fun and balanced, but the ones for Intrigue seemed extremely poorly thought-out and lacked any kind of fun. Guilds mixes really well with all sets, including the big money games you can have with the Dominion: Prosperity expansion.Overall, I really enjoyed this set. There was a little bit of a learning curve adjusting to the new mechanics as is often the case with Dominion, and I don't recommend it for beginners, but Guilds is definitely less complicated than Dominion Dark Ages Expansion and more versatile than Alchemy. If this is truly the final expansion, the designer went out on a high note.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4UAM4LNGBKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9T4KM4#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4UAM4LNGBKC","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a decent but flawed teen vampire tale. I'll lay out the pros and cons below:PROS: The writing is a bit better than average for YA fiction. It certainly starts well and doesn't waste any time getting into the heroine's head and racing off to the first vampire attack.Having a strong heroine who does smart, logical things in her own defense is a refreshing change from the weak, mopey, helpless kind that populate a lot of YA fiction (I'm talking about Bella from Twilight, Rhine from Wither, etc.). Although not a fan of vampiric super-speed, I still enjoyed her resourceful of thieving clothes and equipment from the mall and local stores as well as setting up her lair's defenses.For me, the best part was that the author tries (more or less successfully) to create his own unique take on vampires and their powers, including some metaphysical concepts that I found interesting. However, he tries to make it all explainable by science and that was a bit of a turn-off.CONS: The author loves to show off his knowledge of the NASA facility (where he works) and astronomy, but I don't care about math, space, or science, so I found it annoying and boring. Plus, having the love interest be named after ""Cosmos"" host Carl Sagan was too clever to be believable and I hated hearing the heroine call him ""Sagan,"" over and over. Frankly, as soon as I read it took place mostly at a NASA facility, I almost didn't want to read it. The location was too unique and yet not all that interesting. The book could have been set anywhere, so why pick a place that most readers have no clue about? It makes it harder to imagine. Everybody understands an abandoned factory, but not an abandoned test silo or whatever it was supposed to be.The book needed tighter editing. The same word (such as ""pretty"") would appear in adjacent sentences or within the same paragraph often enough to be annoying.For some reason, all the vampires speak German, despite only the main villain obviously being of German heritage, and the overuse of the foreign language was distracting and annoying, especially as it seemed to serve no real purpose. The story doesn't take place in Germany and all the vampires are Americans from the mid-1800s to early 20th century with nothing called out in their backstory or names to imply they were recent German immigrants. Not all the German words are translated, which is super-annoying. Like I'm supposed to type them into an online translator to read those parts of the book? Fat chance. There's way too much German in the book, and way too much untranslated German. Again, including it serves no point I can see as Germany itself has absolutely nothing to do with the story.I didn't much care for the epilepsy parts, especially calling the grand mal seizures ""tonic-clonics"" because not only does it rhyme, it sounds stupid. It doesn't matter if that's what the seizures are really called or not, it's distracting. I know the heroine's epilepsy was a major plot point, but I never found it all that interesting or credible in how it related to her bungled transformation into a half-vampire.The author frequently fails to credibly write the heroine as a believable sixteen-year-old girl, sounding more like some middle-aged dude trying to write like one. There are a lot of big, technical, or uncommon words throughout the text that no teenage narrator would know or use (the book is told in the first person from the girl's POV). Another example is when the heroine finds inappropriate moments to recall romantic details during scary action scenes. Trust me, you're not going to stop and think about your first kiss while being chased by a vampire through the spot where you had it. I mean, unless you *want* to die. This type of poetic detail does not belong in an action scene as it slows and dilutes the tension. Keep those thoughts for the quiet moments.All the swear words are cut out with ellipses ( . . . ) or are intact but in German, making me feel like the book was more than a bit old-fashioned and prudish, having been dumbed down for its target teen audience when most YA books these days include at least a little cursing, and the book feels like some kind of neutered throwback to 70s/80s YA without any, even the milder ones.There was not enough romance (and no sex), but some fairly explicit gore. Twilight fans should look elsewhere.The middle drags. There's not much in the way of vampire attacks, and it takes forever for the villain to show up in person, instead he shows up in her dreams, astral projecting into her room a few times. I liked the astral projecting part, but it's not enough to sustain the suspense. I was anxious for the book to be over. It should have been *at least* a hundred pages shorter. The side-story about a good vs. evil vampire war never really felt fleshed out and worse, didn't go anywhere, making the heroine's entire time spent with the good vampires an info-dumpy ""who cares?"" None of the other vampires in the entire book were fully realized, interesting characters, including the cartoony villain. This side-story should have been cut.Some tech items that seemed like they would be important for the climax turned out not to be (like the solar flare viewer, the deadly acid vial, etc.) or felt underused or used incorrectly. For example, the heroine brags about possibly using a garden hoe to kill vampires, then never uses it herself. She brags about the acid vial being so deadly she's afraid to even carry it around, then the villain drinks it on his own and nothing happens to him except he gets a sore throat! Dumb, dumb, dumb. What's the point?The heroine has specialized knowledge it does not seem credible for her to have about medieval siege tactics (despite the info-dumpy way the author tries to justify it), as well as rigging up home defenses, alarms, and safe zones, plus knowledge of technical names for things like a ""gantry"" that a girl of her age and background would never believably know. It's like she turns into Rambo all of a sudden. That felt forced and was never properly set up. If she came from a survivalist background, then sure. But she doesn't.I was disappointed by the ending which tries to turn the book into a brain-dead action movie, but then fails to commit even to that, having the girl hesitate or decide not to kill her attackers when she knows it's a fight to the death situation and mercy will only get her and her friends killed. Also, nobody on the NASA base sees or hears the explosions or comes to investigate all the screaming, a jeep being thrown through the air, or the raging fire. Way too convenient. Which is one of the biggest problems with setting the story on a NASA base, even an abandoned part. There's still people working on the base and round the clock guard patrols.The cover art, title font, and overall book design are cheesy and cheap-looking, making me not want to pick it up. Only the fact it was a teen vampire tale made me give it a chance.VERDICT: The unique vampire powers/physiology and metaphysics like astral projection and auras are what really make this book worth a read. The rest of it (past the great opening) is just OK. Although the cons clearly outweigh the pros, I didn't dislike the book enough to give up on it and I will try other books by this author. All in all, Throat tries hard to stand out from other teen vampire books and give us something different. I respect that even if the author doesn't always succeed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VMHEEGVETFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375861386#wasThisHelpful","R39VMHEEGVETFT","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are certified organic, gluten-free noodles with just a hint of pumpkin/ginger flavor to them. I wish they had more flavor on their own, but they do easily absorb the flavor of whatever dish you put them in. You get three single person servings per bag, each one parceled out and bound. The lack of quantity is kind of a let down. Overall, I do like this product when I'm making asian noodle dishes. It has the taste and texture of regular wheat noodles only without the wheat/gluten so I can eat them with my food allergies and they are ready to eat in under 10 minutes. My only real concern is all King Soba products are made in China, which makes me slightly concerned as to their integrity even with the certified organic label on the package. They also make gluten-free King Soba Brown Rice Ramen (Pack of 3) (see my review) and buckwheat ramen. The package includes multilingual directions in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.Tinkyada makes a variety of delicious non-asian, non-flavored gluten-free Italian pastas (in natural and organic varieties) and their products are made in the USA.

"A bunch of alien energy beings, research scientists from another planet, are sent to earth on an experiment on humans by possessing them. Some of the aliens, unused to having physical bodies and emotions, learn to enjoy indulging themselves in sex and violence and turn selfish and evil as a result. They have a fight with their alien brethren by pitting the possessed humans against each other. The story is told in the most hateful, homophobic, and politically incorrect way possible. It read like a parody of right-wing values, that's how far right it went--straight off a cliff.The basic concept of the story is OK, and I think I can see some sort of angel/demon religious allegory in the subtext, but in the hands of prolific hack fiction author, William W. Johnstone, it becomes a muddled mess even worse than his usual brain-dead nonsense. THEM is without a doubt the dumbest, most poorly written book in his entire career. None of his 200+ books are what I would call good, but some are at least entertaining in a cheesy, guilty pleasure sort of way (for example, the first three books in his over-the-top ""Devil's"" series: The Devil's Kiss, The Devil's Touch, The Devil's Heart). Unfortunately, THEM is entertaining in a whole different way. You will be laughing at the author's feebleminded incompetence from page one. The torture of reading this monumental failure is beyond words. It's like a bad 50s sci-fi movie written by a paranoid rightwing redneck choking on his own hatred and lack of I.Q. This is hilarious, pathetic, ridiculous junk that never deserved to be published. I doubt it was even edited or went much beyond a first draft.Johnstone was one of those crummy authors who had to publish something like ten books a year because he couldn't write one good blockbuster instead. Which would be OK since some of his early to mid-1980s stuff was so bad it's good, but by the mid to late 1980s, even the subpar quality he'd set for himself started going down the toilet, and kept plummeting in that direction right up until the day he died in 2003 (THEM was written in the 90s). Instead of putting entertainment first as any good fiction writer should, Johnstone became increasingly obsessed with editorializing, forcing his bitter, hateful, grumpy old man far-right political and religious opinions into everything, including a manifesto for creating a fascist Christian dictatorship (ostensibly written to complement his From The Ashes: America Reborn post-apocalyptic series, but it seems obvious to me that this was what he wanted America to become in reality).Note: To be fair, somehow Johnstone has mindbogglingly managed to get on the New York Times bestsellers list (more than once, even after his death), but I think this speaks more to the fanaticism of a fanbase that shares his far-right values than to Johnstone's alleged ""talent.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VEPPEIA1EIFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786014253#wasThisHelpful","R1VEPPEIA1EIFB","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good, comprehensive book detailing hero and heroine archetypes and how they interact with each other. Followed by Tami Cowden's solo sequel, Fallen Heroes: Sixteen Master Villain Archetypes, which is also good, but unfortunately does not attempt to explain how the villains interact with the heroes and heroines in this book.Another book I like that offers the same idea as this one is 45 Master Characters, Revised Edition: Mythic Models for Creating Original Characters by Victoria Schmidt. It not only has a character archetypes, but a complete breakdown and worksheets for charting the different adventure paths for males vs. females. Also recommended is The Virgin's Promise: Writing Stories of Feminine Creative, Spiritual, and Sexual Awakening by Kim Hudson, which focuses on a step by step guide to creating feminine adventures vs. male ones (but a slightly different system than in 45 Master Characters). Both 45 MC and VP provide an easy to understand breakdown of Maureen Murdock's The Heroine's Journey, which itself is a feminine version of Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell) (the Hero's Journey; theory of mythic storytelling structure used in Star Wars, The Lion King, etc., which Christoher Vogler breaks down for writers in The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, 3rd Edition).And not just for its screenplay advice, but because it is easily adapted for novelists, I recommend My Story Can Beat Up Your Story: Ten Ways to Toughen Up Your Screenplay from Opening Hook to Knockout Punch by Jeffrey Schechter. It espouses a Jungian theory of a ""unity of opposites,"" so both the hero and the villain and their teams will be mirror images of each other and be out to prove the opposite (or some more reasonable compromise) of the story's theme (such ""faith vs. technology"" in Star Wars). It provides great examples of this theory from blockbusters like Star Wars, Star Trek, the Dark Knight, etc. If you go to the author's website (with the url link in the book), you can download a cut chapter that extends the mirror image theory not just to the characters, but the first half and last half of the story. So some action that happens in the first half is repeated in the second, only on a larger scale with more dramatic results, which readers like because of its circularity.Unfortunately, not all of the archetype books mesh well with each other's systems (nor do all the story structure ones), so you might want to pick one to get you started. What's nice about The Complete Guide to Heroes and Heroines is it has the villain sequel, however, that doesn't mean these are the best books on the subject. They're a perfectly good choice, and deliver exactly what they promise, but I love getting the mythic hero/heroine journey story structure help and find myself referring far more to those books throughout the writing process than books that solely provide archetypes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W49RT9BVOVUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580650244#wasThisHelpful","R3W49RT9BVOVUX","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roundworm/tapeworm infestations can cause secondary bacterial infections in their gut, such as spirochetes that cause insanely chronic diarrhea, so you may need to get your dewormed cat both a probiotic like Endurosyn (to restore the healthy bacteria) and an antibiotic (to kill/reduce the population of the unhealthy ones back to normal levels).The dispenser syringe is kind of annoying and doesn't come with instructions how to work it (at least, mine didn't, but I got mine directly from my vet so maybe it does come with some, I can't be sure). You have to unscrew the base ring to the dose line to get it to work. Once it does, you do get totally accurate dosing, but my kitten does not like the taste of this stuff, which means I always end up with about half the dose on her ruff or the outside of the tube. I have found hiding whatever I can scrape off the tube inside pill pockets works well at getting the rest in her, even when I do a sloppy job of hiding it. Other than the (at first) counter-intuitive syringe and bad smell/taste (plus it's poop brown and looks and feels like paste, not gel), Endurosyn works well at getting your cat the probiotics it needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R290WKFY7WEP3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E308BA#wasThisHelpful","R290WKFY7WEP3N","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why this is selling under a different title, but it appears to be the same book as The Bitch Posse by Martha O'Connor (lots more reviews for that version, by the way). The story alternates between three different women--in high school in 1988--and years later in 2003 as 33-year-old adults. The chapters switch point of view and time as each woman recounts her messed-up life with and without her friends from the Bitch Posse. Little by little, the terrible secret that bound them together and tore them apart is revealed. Has some similarities to Lois Duncan's 1979 Young Adult feminist thriller, Daughters of Eve and to Kerry Cohen's Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promiscuity.Although this is technically considered ""chick-lit,"" it's more like ""bitch-lit."" It's got a very dark, gritty edge to it with swearing, cutting, mental illness, abortion, drinking and drug abuse, plus many graphic sex scenes that make this book appeal to both male and female readers looking for a well-written, twisted story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10R2EUMF2VPCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752867393#wasThisHelpful","R10R2EUMF2VPCE","A14TUWXDA5WQ7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14TUWXDA5WQ7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"XEN-TAN Moroccan Tan Ultra actually does an excellent job of simulating a natural sun tan. It mimics my natural sun tanned skin color very closely, great for extending my tan through the winter months. The color lasts a few days before it starts fading significantly, though it doesn't streak or leave any splotchy patches like some products do. Application is very easy and foolproof if you follow the provided instructions.One thing to note is that I have mildly sensitive skin and I tend to get a little itchy from the drying effect of most of these sunless tanning products.

"This is a great value in a basic indoor cycling bike. The heavy steel frame is extremely durable and all of the joints are fully welded, not tack welded like some lesser quality brands. The bike comes well packaged and the parts protected, the smaller parts bagged. Assembly was incredibly easy and only took about 15 minutes total. The provided tool allows you to assemble the bike without the need of any other tools of your own.Thanks to the wheels on the front support bar, lifting this up and rolling it around is an absolute breeze. The seat and handlebars are both fully adjustable up and down as well as forward and back, not to mention the seat pivots and locks securely in place. This indoor cycle fits my 5'6"" frame fine and can easily adjust to fit those well over 6' without any problems at all.The 40 pound flywheel provides a smooth and consistent resistance that is easily adjusted on the go with just the turn of a knob that also doubles as a brake, and the brake will definitely stop the rotation in a hurry; I was a bit surprised at just how smoothly and quickly the brake works.Even the water bottle holder is heavy coated wire that is very durable and held to the frame very securely with two strong bolts. No cheap plastic cup holder... I think that actually impressed me more than anything.

"When you buy cheap furniture, you get less than stellar quality, and this South Shore piece is no exception. For what you get, it's okay, but it does have some disappointing areas even knowing it's low-budget furniture. First off, it is a nice size chest of drawers with a decent capacity. The laminate coating that gives it a finished woodgrain appearance came without any scuffs or marring, which was a pleasant surprise. The unit is also heavy and stable on it's feet, which is a very good thing. Another nice surprise was it came with the ability to mount the back of the chest to the studs in a wall to provide extra stability should you have tots that insist on climbing around on everything they shouldn't.The assembly experience could have been a lot better. While I had no problem doing the entire assembly by myself, the instructions were lacking in description and details. You pretty much just had to follow the little pictures and hope for the best. At least all of the necessary hardware was there with no missing pieces. They were even thoughtful enough to throw in a touch-up marker.Sadly, the assembled piece is about as elegant as a brick. It is rectangular. Every part of it ends in sharp, square edges. There are soft contours to be found, no sculpted edges, no fancy lips or corners on anything. Even the drawer pulls are small and simplistic.Any major problems? One of the legs (or front feet, if you prefer) was partially cracked through along the grain, but not enough to effect stability or integrity. I just hid the cracked side to the inside where nobody could see it.All of the drawer runners and and sliders are plastic and they simply press into the MDF panels. I can see these getting wallowed loose after a while just from the natural weight shifting caused by opening and closing the drawers. It's just a matter time. They are also non-adjustable, which is a shame because the drawers DO NOT line up perfectly even. Some of them cause the drawers to sit slightly cockeyed which is noticeable when all the drawers are closed.Also, some of the drawers stick out slightly father on one side than the other when the unit is completely assembled. This is confirmed to be caused by a combination of misaligned holes drilled from the factory that aren't even from one drawer section to the next, as well as from the front panels of each drawer being slightly warped, which was confirmed by checking them with a carpenter's square.Still, this is a cheaply priced chest of drawers, so it's no surprise that it's cheaply made. Nonetheless, it is a perfectly suitable chest for a guest room, a child's room, or anywhere else you don't really need or particularly want nicer furniture to be located.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24S2SUZM22OJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H24EMFQ#wasThisHelpful","R24S2SUZM22OJQ","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fleece shirt from Wrangler is everything you'd expect from the brand. It has quality seams with even stitching and a true to size fit with generous shoulder and arms for freedom of movement. The pockets are nicely sized too. The fleece material is slightly warmer than your average flannel shirt, but it isn't as heavy duty or rugged as a chamois shirt. The fleece material is perfect for light-duty wear where you won't be subjecting the shirt to much abuse. It is a warm shirt for those cool autumn days, and it can even be used as a shirt-jacket on breezy days while helping to keep the wind out. On bitter days, better break out the chamois shirt though, as a harsh winter wind will definitely cut through the less dense fleece material.

For those new to the countertop espresso makers, you'll probably find the instruction books a bit lacking, they tell you how to use the machine, but it doesn't really tell you how to USE the machine to get good results. For that, you'll either want to buy some books, watch some online videos, or get help from some experienced friends. Once you actually learn how to use the machine properly, you'll get excellent results time after time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS38CJ8Q8UG5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6ZNU#wasThisHelpful","RS38CJ8Q8UG5C","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ace bandages have been a trusted name in my household for as long as I can remember. They are quality products that get the job done. The fastener on this bandage is leagues better than the old metal clips with sharp pointy teeth; they hold better and don't bend or poke like the old ones did. As a compression bandage, this can be adjusted for various amounts of compression, and while it does seem to stretch a little over the course of a day, it isn't nearly as bad as some cheaper products do.

"CAD has been around a long time and is well known in both the pro and home-recording circles. They are known for producing good quality products with performance that in many cases exceeds their price bracket.With the ZOE USB condenser mic, you have an affordable recording solution that is virtually plug and play. Just plug it in and Windows will automatically detect it, and you're ready to start using it within seconds. It really doesn't get any easier than that!Build quality is decent. The plastic housing is lightweight, but doesn't flex or feel flimsy. Sure, it's no tank like the old Astatic D-104, but it can surely hold it's own against a few bumps and bruises. (Like the cat jumping on the desk and knocking it over).The little supplied tripod is easy to set up, just extend the legs all the way, screw the mic onto the mount, and plop that baby down. Of course this little tripod stand is no good at damping vibrations, and it just doesn't feel all that sturdy. Luckily, the screw mount is the same size as most universal mic stands and desk stands, so go spend 15 or 20 bucks on a more solidly built stand with a shock absorbing base pad if you feel you the need, since the mic will screw right on and be good to go.The microphone size is actually pretty darn small. I was impressed with the small size, which is great for travel since packing it in the laptop bag is a lot easier when you don't have a lot of bulk. For comparison sake it's about half the size of my Heil PR-40 broadcast mic, or about the same diameter as my Heil PR20 stage mic and half the length. Yes, it really is that compact! For those wanting to record in 24-bit mode, you're going to be sorely out of luck. You have two choices with this one: 16/44.1 or 16/48. For things like Skype calls, Google Hangouts, recording podcasts, video conferencing, and assorted VOIP platforms like TeamSpeak 3, Mumble, or Ventrillo, then these settings will be just fine and are perfectly suited for those uses. It even works great for EchoLink if you're an amateur radio operator.Headphone output is loud and clear, and it's really easy to adjust the volume with the buttons on the front of the mic body. It had no problem whatsoever giving a solid, loud signal to my Audio-Technica ATH-M50s headphones. In fact, there was plenty of volume adjustment loudness to spare.Finally, sound quality. At this price point you aren't going to get sound quality that matches pro recording gear, and you shouldn't expect to. But here's the thing: it'll get you 90% there, and most people with untrained ears wouldn't be able to notice that last 10% anyways. Especially not for things like VOIP and podcasts going to Youtube where the audio is butchered and usually highly compressed anyways.The sound is a little bit mid-present with articulate highs that help with intelligibility, but not so mid-forward that it imparts that godawful stuffy, nasal honk I tend to hear far too often from other mics (at least on my voice). You do get a nice warm proximity effect up to about 3 inches away from the mic, but any closer and it starts turning to mud. Considering that this isn't a dynamic mic, you should be trying to eat the mesh anyways. Anywhere from 6 to 3 inches provides a rich, full sound. Just play with the placement for your particular voice and situation and use your ears; you'll know when it sounds good and when it doesn't.The 50 Hz low frequency roll-off is an interesting choice. It helps eliminate deeper LF rumbling, while preserving a good amount of the lower octave of the voice for that chesty resonance. Most other mics either don't roll off at all, or they'll start to roll off at 80 or 120 Hz which tends to suck a little too much of the fullness out of a lot of voices. I think CAD made a wise choice choosing 50 Hz for this mic.Overall, it's a decent little mic with a lot of good going for it. Some people might need a slightly longer USB cable than the one provided, but for most people the one included will be fine. In my case it was barely long enough, but did work. Sound quality is decent and you'd be hard pressed to find anything audibly better at this price point. If you need a compact USB mic with low-latency monitoring and good sound quality, I really can't see any substantial reason not to recommend getting one of these and giving it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38XTQ5ZHENC2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFMPBA4#wasThisHelpful","R38XTQ5ZHENC2B","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being the owner of a couple different Heil microphones (the Heil Goldline Pro and the Heil Heritage) which never fail to impress, I decided it was time to step up to the Heil PR-40 to see what it was capable of as well. I purchased the Heil PR-40 to serve a few different purposes, mainly as a new mic for my ham radio, but also for use in VOIP applications, and finally to use for recording narration for videos. It suits all of these purposes just fine, but of course I knew this already since the same source is used for all those applications, that being my voice.The mic itself is everything I would expect of a Heil microphone. It build ruggedly, and has a beautiful, flawless finish. The PR-40 comes in a padded leatherette carrying case that also holds the included mic clamp. The clamp has an adapter that screws in to allow the clamp to be used on different sized stands and boom arms. Also included was a Heil Sound decal. I have to say I'm disappointed the Heil mics don't come in the wooden presentation boxes they used to, but I am quite happy with the padded case they use now too.The XLR jack on the mic is a little tight, it took a lot of effort to get the Neutrik XLR connector on my mic cable to lock into place. Removing the o-ring from the Neutrik connector on the mic cable allows the cable to lock into the PR-40 with no effort, but I prefer the slight amount of compression the o-ring provides to help keep dust out as well as prevent any rattling.The thing about Heil mics is they pretty much occupy their own audio space in the world of mics. Nothing else comes close to sounding like a Heil mic, their timbre is unmistakable, but in a good way. A lot of people have trouble getting used to Heil mics because they're used to older design mics that need a lot of EQ to make them sound good. With Heil mics, they don't require an obscene amount of EQ to make them sound great, they pretty much sound great with the EQ set flat.What I really like about the Heil PR-40 is it has a slightly scooped mid-range that takes the nasal ""honk"" and stuffiness out of my voice. I've never used a mic that sounded so broadcast-ready right out of box, and much of that is helped by the extended low-frequency response (when compared to most other dynamic mics) that picks up more of the deep chest resonance of the person talking or singing into the mic. Of course, this also makes the mic more prone to picking up low frequency rumble, but installing the mic in the optional accessory shock mount takes care of that problem without having to EQ out the low frequencies, which EQ really should always be left as a last-ditch bandaid only anyways, as you're essentially EQ'ing out an entire octave of the human voice.Proximity effect is really sweet on this mic. With the PR-40 anything more than 6 inches away from the mouth starts sounding way too thin, with the sweet spot being around 2-4 inches from the grill. However, you can literally get your lips right up against the grill and the proximity effect is still controlled to the point that the bass never becomes too thick or muddy, the mic just takes on an extremely warm, intimate sound that is absolutely spectacular.Even though the mic comes with an internal sorbothane shock mounted capsule, the mic is still fairly prone to picking up low frequency through the mic stand or boom arm. I highly recommend getting the accessory shock mount to go with this mic, I guarantee it will make a world of difference.What can I say? I'm more impressed by the mic than I thought I would be. I can gladly say I have absolutely no buyer's remorse whatsoever. This one is definitely a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAA6F62S482D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQYBRNY#wasThisHelpful","R1JAA6F62S482D","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice rice cooker overall, but there are a couple small issues that could be improved which I'll cover last. First of all, the brushed stainless finish is very pleasing to the eye and it goes nicely with the rest of my kitchen appliances. There are thoughtful little things like the carry handle, as well as the slots  on the sides to hold the included utensils.Functionally, the rice cooker is very easy to use. The included instruction manual is thorough and easy to understand. The included clock even holds the time while the unit is unplugged. So far I have used this cooker for white rice, brown rice, and sticky rice. It has cooked all of my rice selections wonderfully well, and without the hassle of conventional cooking. The convenience is absolutely worth it to me.Cleanup is a breeze. The coating in the cooker pot is very non-stick and any residue just wipes right out with a damp cloth; no scrubbing necessary.The reason I gave this rice cooker 4 stars instead of 5 is as follows:First, the sample I received has a slightly marred control panel. For an item of this price level, it should have had better quality inspection before it was boxed. While it doesn't affect the performance, it is an ugly blemish on what should have been a gorgeous kitchen appliance.Second, the feet are very slick. This cooker slides around on the counter-top effortlessly. A small child or a curious cat could easily send this thing careening off onto the floor with no problem whatsoever. It would have been nice if they had added some rubber feet or other grippy material to the base so that the cooker doesn't slide around so easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O51ZR2184WAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLSIINU#wasThisHelpful","R3O51ZR2184WAG","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black & Decker has a very nice slow cooker with this model. The stoneware pot does a great job of holding an even heat across the entire cooking area, and is also very easy to clean up. The tempered glass lid is vented enough where it meets the pot so that steam can escape with causing any rattling. The printed design on the cooker looks nice and fits in well enough with my kitchen decor.I am especially impressed with the sticky rubber feet that really grip smooth countertop surfaces, keeping the cooker exactly where you put it.I am not as impressed with the lid handle, main cooker handles, or the control knob.

I'm not knocking off a star for this though, as they are performing fine so far and only time will tell as to their durability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13FS1T4IT1K3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5XJ9FG#wasThisHelpful","R13FS1T4IT1K3K","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The compact size of this Eton FR1 radio is one of the major conveniences when stocking your emergency kit. The features are fairly basic for this model. AM/FM radio, WX radio, flashlight, and hand-crank. There is no solar cell on this model like others, but for most purposes it wouldn't be needed anyways.Reception is decent, though not great. There are other models from other brands at this price point that do a better job at receiving local FM and WX stations, but they are also more bulky. If you're in a rural area that might be a problem, but in more populated areas and major cities, the performance would be absolutely fine.The plastic housing on this radio is creaky, and not as durable or rugged feeling as the older models were. Whether that affects its longevity or durability has yet to be seen, but for an emergency product that will see infrequent use, I doubt it will pose any problems.The only real issue I have with this device is not the product itself, but the owner's manual. The manual lacks much in the way of detail or specifics. For instance, this device allows for charging it's internal battery from a USB power source. It does not, however, state whether it's okay to leave it plugged in permanently via USB to keep it topped off via a maintenance charge, or if this will cause the battery to overcharge thereby damaging it and shortening it's life. Including details like that in the instructions would be very helpful.Overall it's a good basic emergency radio.

The flippers only turn in the forward direction, but don't work in reverse (this is expected as the trap is on the rear only). The concept is similar to that of a carpet sweeper, only this is for hard floors.

Knowing the brand so well, I had high expectations for this bar of body soap, and I can say without a doubt that it lives up to the fine reputation it's earned with me. The soap is quad-milled and creates a smooth, creamy lather that is top-notch.

It is great for cutting down saplings and removing low hanging branches from trees. Don't expect it to take down 8"" diameter oaks though, as this thing will definitely choke on those. When applying a little common sense to using the right tool for the right job, this tool definitely has it's place and usefulness. The battery life is seems to be okay, it hasn't run out juice during work sessions, and I make it point to recharge the battery each time I finish a job so it's good to go for the next.I only give this 4 out of 5 stars though, as the construction feels a little flimsy, the plastic creaks and flexes more than I'd like. I also had to sharpen the chain before the first use as it was relatively dull right out of the box.  Other than that, it's a good light-duty tool for those that don't need the power or longer bar length of a gas chainsaw.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O458WAG39C7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVT18I2#wasThisHelpful","R1O458WAG39C7Z","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it's still too early to know if this is going to have any tangible, lasting benefit, the LED device does at least give the face a nice warm massage. The science behind the product says that it stimulates an increase in collagen. While this holds true for very expensive professional treatments, this handheld device skirts the lower limits of what might be considered ineffective. Time will tell, but I'm not going to down-rate a product based on an unknown. What the device does do for certain is make your face feel good.

"I was skeptical of this camping pad, thinking the design would make it be uncomfortable. I'm happy to say I was wrong with my skepticism, and this camping pad has turned out to be something I don't want to be without when I'm out camping. This thing is very comfortable to sleep on.The small, lightweight design makes packing it into camp a breeze as the storage size when not inflated is relatively compact. Because of it's design, it can be used either inside or underneath a sleeping bag, but I've found I prefer it to be inside a roomy sleeping bag for the most comfort. The design allows air pockets to be formed that help keep the body at a comfortable temperature, neither too warm nor too cool. If you're one who sweats a lot in their sleep, this will definitely be a help in keeping you from getting damp and clammy or feeling like you're stewing in your own sweat.I've not owned this long enough to speak of it's durability, but it seems to be a well made product and I expect no problems out of it for the foreseeable future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYLB6O2NTH0VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","RYLB6O2NTH0VY","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This unit replaced a much older entry level Fellowes paper shredder that I bought many years ago. While the old one still worked fine after years of nearly daily use, I was glad to set it aside and give this new model a try. This model comes with it's own basket to catch the paper shreds, which is very convenient and more secure than the adjustable slider on the old one. The noise level is about the same, there is no mistaking this one is running. Since the shredder covers the entire basket, it adds a more refined look to my office area. The window near the top of the basket is great for seeing when the unit needs emptying.This shredder is very efficient at shredding paper and cross-cutting it, which makes for a more secure shred and harder to reconstruct. (Always reminds me of the Penguin in the Batman movie ""a little patience and a LOT of tape."") Though I haven't tried shredding at max capacity, it handles 5 sheets of standard copy paper at a time just fine. Does a number on unopened junk mail too, which would jam up the old unit half the time.The safety lock is a nice additional feature on this shredder. Especially when the cats try to use it as a jumping platform.My only nitpick is the power cord isn't all that long. It would have saved me an extension cord if the power cord would have been about 2 feet longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQI9FUYJXCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLRLFSU#wasThisHelpful","RKQI9FUYJXCZ","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really liked how easy it was to get this grass seed started. It seems to be heat resistant enough to handle full sun here in Florida, though it tends to start browning out a little faster than some varieties during an extended dry spell. With that in mind, this is the grass for you if you're a regular with keeping up with watering. On the other hand, if you're a water-miser, you might consider looking elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YVQTQ1DAIA37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8NI648#wasThisHelpful","R1YVQTQ1DAIA37","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tend not to give very many books a five star rating because I'm such a nitpicky reader. If the story doesn't completely gel, if the ending feels too rushed, or if the characters are generic and one-sided, it all just takes away from what should have been a wonderful journey of book reading. Consume managed to tick all of the boxes for me and earn that coveted 5-star review. Now, this isn't a book report, I'm not going to sit here and ruin the story for you by giving you a TL;DR play by play of the important plot points. What I will say is this book is fantastically fun to read. It held my attention from the start and didn't let go even after finishing the last page. The wording is artfully styled, I hesitate to say a ""beautiful prose"", but it is far from dry reading. The characters are well developed and each one has its own personality that you'll love or hate. Everything about this book shows that the author put a lot of time and effort into crafting a memorable and enjoyable story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7H5Z8JH2CRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373210876#wasThisHelpful","RR7H5Z8JH2CRR","A3G007LQX6KGOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G007LQX6KGOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this trimmer to replace an almost-identical Conair trimmer (model GMT170B) I bought 10 years ago.  The old one had finally become dull.  Do yourself a favor and forget the rechargeable models...AA battery-operated trimmers are the way to go.This trimmer works as well as the old one.  It is slightly noisier, but not bothersome.  The beard trimming head snaps off and a nose/ear trimming blade easily snaps on (my old model did not do noses).  Both implements function very well.Complaint:  The adjustable blade guard fits **VERY** tight.  It is a real struggle to move it it.  It feels like you are going to break it.  IT IS WAY TOO TIGHT!

"Part arrived very quickly from supplier.  No trouble there.  Supplied motor was a perfect mechanical replacement for the motor in a 25 year-old Kenmore dryer.  My old motor had no wiring harness or plug; all the wires were connected individually.Had the usual trouble (read other reviews) getting the blower fan off.  No need for it to be that tight, considering the fan and threads are made of plastic with a square mounting shaft.  It is incredibly easy to round this shaft off, no matter how careful you are.  Believe it or not, I had to finally use an air impact wrench on the front motor shaft to remove the fan.Part came with two sets of wiring instructions...one larger and one smaller, apparently identical copies of each other.  Followed the wiring instructions, would not start.  Two frustrating hours later, examined both sets of instructions with a magnifying glass, and noted that they were completely identical, except for the placement of one wire!!  Of course this was after I had made all the wiring modifications, and used up all the weirdo wire terminals supplied.The instructions and wiring diagrams are not just terrible; they are misleading...even for a relatively handy person.  BTW, the instructions that were ""correct"" for my dryer were the ""small"" ones.Motor is tremendously loud, to the point where you would swear something is wrong.  I actually took the back of the dryer off to see if anything else was amiss.  Nothing else is wrong, it's just LOUD.

"These cameras are amazing! Until I started doing some research, I had no idea these cameras each encompassed a tiny computer and web server!  My mind was still back in the day when analog video went down a wire.I studied the reviews of this camera here on Amazon for a couple of hours, trying to figure out where most of the snags and pitfalls were, in advance of ordering.  For example, here is a handy tip from another user: ""If you want to use the preset camera positions you MUST first uncheck the ""disable preset"" box in the PTZ menu under Administrator.""  You could spend hours trying to figure out the 'presets' without that little tiny tip.  Thank you!  Once I compiled a list of things like that that were likely to go wrong, and fixes for them, I ordered two cameras.It took me a couple of hours to get two of these set up, with my bare-bones knowledge of IP's, routers, and networking.You have to take the setup step-by-step, and test between steps!  Don't try to do it all at once! Once you get one function working, proceed to the next level.  There is a lot of useful information written in straight English on the Foscam site, so I hardly looked at the manual.The little program they supply called 'IP Camera Tool' is incredibly useful in getting things set up.I did NOT use the CD.  I just downloaded the latest firmware from Foscam, and updated that on the cameras once they were hooked up (one at a time) thru the ethernet cable.  There are two parts to the firmware, a ""System Firmware"" and a ""Web UI"" firmware. Update both. My cameras were one version behind.I was able to get video through the ethernet cable in a couple of minutes.  I set mine up as fixed IP's so their IP addresses would be a different numerical series than computers, but you don't have to do that if you don't know how.  Wireless setup was easy; once you set the IP, enable wireless, and reboot (the camera), you should pull the ethernet (NOT the power) cable.  The cam should then communicate by wireless after a minute or so.  Once the wireless was working, it was easy to set the motion alarm.  Once I got the motion alarm going, I had the system start emailing images to me (had the camera trained on a busy suburban street).  In order to test the email settings, you have to hit SUBMIT before you hit TEST, another little tip.  And when you see the mysterious words ""Network Lamp,"" that particular function turns the blinking green network light on the back of the camera on and off.Pretty soon I was getting more email messages than I could stand, so I set up a FTP service to a website I own where I can store the pictures.If you use Internet Explorer you are home free, you can view an array of cameras with one login, and monitor sound, too.  I don't like Internet Explorer, I use Firefox, so right now I have to login to each camera for live viewing.  There are plenty of free or cheap monitoring solutions out there.  Last night I tested out iSpy which seems to do the job of monitoring multiple cameras for not so much dinero.  Once I get it all figured out, I will settle down on a permanent monitoring solution.  But at first, you will just monitor through your Internet Browser.Setting up port-forwarding for worldwide-internet-viewing was pretty darn easy considering how much jabber there is in these reviews about it (You need to use a proxy, or go to the coffee shop, to test port-forwarding...I couldn't get it to work until I logged in with a proxy...found that tip on Amazon, too!).Everything is crystal-clear, with no noise.  The night-vision will light up a large room.Seriously, if you have no concept of what an IP address is, or you don't know how to access your router (and you don't want to learn), you should avoid messing with these cameras.  If you just want to run these on your own local network, and you know a little, the complaints about difficult setup are way overstated.These cameras are an outstanding value, but research carefully to understand the limitations before you buy one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZB7AWI0UGDBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZP8UOW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZB7AWI0UGDBT","A2R4BU3S05BGQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R4BU3S05BGQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own both a Lasko 2521 and 2527.  Despite the similar appearance, the fans work differently.  The 2527 is considerably louder, and blows substantially more air.  The 2521 is quieter, and does not blow as much air.I like having some background noise in my office, and I heat up easily.  The 2521 is (barely) quiet enough to be positioned 8 feet from me, while set on ""low"".  However, the 2527 provides too much noise (and air) for this use, even on ""low"".The 2527 is used in another location where I need more airflow (blowing air between rooms), and I am not as concerned about the noise.  Therefore, it works better in this situation than the 2521 would.Neither fan could be considered anywhere near ""whisper quiet"" when used in a quiet room, and the fan is within 10 feet of you.  However, if you want the quieter of the two, go with the the 2521. If you want maximum airflow, or you're working in a noisy shop, no doubt the 2527 will serve you better.By the way, my 2521 and 2527 replaced two other Laskos that each ran 9 months a year, 12-16 hours per day, for 15 years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JHYLSGBW4XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RMKPME#wasThisHelpful","R2JHYLSGBW4XP","A2R4BU3S05BGQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R4BU3S05BGQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This microphone stand is cheap, and it does a good job holding a large microphone steady.  However, I purchased this stand so the microphone could be extended forward towards me, perhaps hanging a little over the desktop.  Unfortunately, the gooseneck as pictured on Amazon is much longer than the one I received.  My gooseneck is approximately 7"" long; the one pictured in the ad is at least 12"" long (See the user pictures I posted at the top of the listing).I did try a 12"" gooseneck with this stand, and it was unstable with my 1-pound microphone.  So, Pyle probably decided it was too unstable and substituted a shorter gooseneck.  Amazon should update the picture to show what you will actually get.

"I am going to concentrate on the heating characteristics of this appliance, as others have covered most of the features pretty well.All ""modern"" slow cookers cook food to hotter temperatures in faster times than the old slow-cookers of yore.  The trouble these days is finding a slow-cooker that does not get too hot...too fast; this defeats the entire purpose of buying a ""slow-cooker"" in the first place.I recently tried another brand of cooker that, when set on ""low,""  brought a full load of water to a rolling boil in less than 2 hours!  This is unacceptable for a slow cooker.  If you expect to leave such a ""fast-cooker"" for a full work day, your meal will be petrified when you return.I tested this slow cooker by checking the temperature of a full pot of water as it heated on ""Low"" over a 6 1/2 hour period.  The GRAPH OF THE RESULTS is available in the product pictures at the top of the listing.  In summary, this slow cooker heated a full load of room-temperature water to a temperature of approximately 205 degrees Fahrenheit over the test period.  This seems to indicate that this particular appliance will be less prone to overcooking in a given time period than some other slow-cooker models, though it will still cook faster than a ""vintage"" slow-cooker!In comparison, my 35-year-old vintage slow-cooker reaches a maximum temperature of 195 degrees Fahrenheit over a 12-HOUR period when set on ""Low.""  My old ""vintage"" cooker will not ruin a meal during a workday.  However, slow-cookers that actually cook ""slow"" seem to be unavailable these days, due to the manufacturers yammering with the heat controls.By starting off with refrigerator-cold ingredients (instead of water at 74 degrees, as I did), you can probably manage to cook a decent meal in a normal 9-10 hour workday with this thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5AT2R2S42BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026A7GRM#wasThisHelpful","R2W5AT2R2S42BO","A2R4BU3S05BGQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R4BU3S05BGQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE AFTER TEN DAYS OF USE:  Absolutely amazing.  The barking fron next door has dwindled to nothing.  You would not even know there were any dogs there.  I can't believe we suffered so long.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Based on the reviews, it looks like the Lentek Bark Free works about half the time.  So I took a chance.  So far, it's working!  The two dogs next door quit barking the moment it was put out there, 4 days ago.  Tonight I detected a minor amount of barking, nothing like previous to the Lentek.  The dog was now standing on the other side of his yard (away from my fence and the Lentek) barking occasionally at about 1/4 of his former volume, so I can no longer hear them....unless I'm trying to hear them.  My back yard is the standard small suburban back yard, about 50' deep by 90' wide.  I can see how this thing would not work on an acreage; the dog needs to be within a few feet of it to trigger it.  It is completely silent to (my) human ears.  The 50' cord and power supply is great, who wants to worry about batteries in these things?

"Beats the heck out of a plastic bag.  Be sure to carefully measure your arm and order the right size.  Somewhat difficult to put on the first time; over a few uses it ""stretches"" and becomes much easier.  Probably tougher than it looks.

"I didn't have much hope for this book when I picked it up from a giveaway pile.  Once I started reading it, I was dumbfounded.  Halfway through their round-the-world trip in their 43' schooner, this Swiss-Family-Robinson group was attacked by killer whales off the coast of South America; their boat sank in less than 2 minutes.  With virtually no provisions, the master led them through a 37-day ordeal in a hair-raising voyage that easily rivals Shackleton's 1916 16-day voyage in the James Caird.  Several reviewers commented that not much emotion is shown in the telling of this book; I submit that I would rather have Dougal Robertson or Shackleton saving my life than someone who is more emotionally ""connected!""

"I'm going to compare this watch to my old Data Link 150, which this watch replaced.Benefits: Cheap, display very easy to read-much more so than the 150, easy to adjust bracelet...took 5 minutes, don't pay $15 to a jeweler for this unless you are a klutz, locking bracelet, USB transfer works great, crown scroll wheel much better than the button-pressing 150 mode, free software is very adequate, password system is very useful and a real necessity to use this thing in the way it was intended.Reservations: It's ugly.  I don't trust the part-plastic bracelet.  I would much prefer (and would GLADLY pay more for, Timex, hint) an upgraded, dressier, all-stainless, silver-and-gold toned case and full stainless bracelet like my 150 came with.

"I bought the D-520Z as my third digital camera. I have many years of photography experience, and have owned more than two dozen 35mm film cameras.This is a great camera for the person who is somewhat fussy, but still wants an easy-to-use optical zoom platform. For the benefit of people who don't read instructions, one may view a just-snapped picture by pressing the display button twice or (better yet) setting the camera up to display the picture for about 2 seconds after snapping it. Also, all settings can be memorized so the camera is ready to go as soon as you fire it up. For instance, I use fill flash on nearly every outdoor shot that involves people, and I have a preference for spot-metering. Both of these items are selectable and memorizable.Although the flash recycle time is a little slow, I consider it a very fair trade-off for being able to use AA batteries and only two of them at that.  Performance with NiMH batteries is outstanding; on a recent vacation I took over 100 pictures, most with flash, with extensive use of the LCD, and never changed batteries.Low-light performance is acceptable to me, and I take a lot of pics indoors.The camera is quite compact (fits easily in a shirt pocket with room to spare), and most important, the body is relatively thin.  Before you buy ANY camera, consider whether you really want to lug that clunky (and expensive) digital camera around for the sake of a possible tiny increase in picture quality.The true measure of any camera is picture quality, and I find this one to be very good.  I'm finicky, and I'm pleased.This camera is not as sexy-looking as some of the competition (read ELPF), but the price is right and I feel beginners and amateurs will be able to take a very high percentage of good pics with this one. Highly recommended...hats off to Olympus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPGZ7WLT5PGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063CWO#wasThisHelpful","R3RPGZ7WLT5PGB","A2R4BU3S05BGQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R4BU3S05BGQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This production is inferior to the 1973 movie in almost every way.  Glenn Carter's portrayal of Jesus is listless...the one exception being the 39 Lashes scene....where no singing is required. Jerome Pradon, while fairly capable, lacks the extra oomph required to do justice to his character.  Pilate (Fred Johanson) deserves jail time for his criminal overacting.

Ideal as a vehicle for getting anyone interested in the history of polar exploration.

Daring, heroic, determined, and intelligent...and caught up in a time before the widespread use of some of our most common and powerful technologies...like internal combustion engines and instant communications...their story is practically without equal in the annals of adventure writing.Whenever I feel I am having a difficult time, I think back to this story and these events, and it certainly helps me to put things in perspective.People who have never known a time without radio, motorized travel, telephones, 911, or rescue helicopters will hardly be able to believe the true events chronicled in this book.A more exciting, tension-filled, true-life chronicle will be very difficult to find.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2000","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0OOTXU74I0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078670621X#wasThisHelpful","R3S0OOTXU74I0I","A2R4BU3S05BGQU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R4BU3S05BGQU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What perfect timing!  I received these gloves just yesterday.  Today, we got our first snowfall of the season with temperatures in the high 20s.  We had to finish up on a job outside, that involved metal (brrr) and I grabbed my fur lined leather gloves, out of habit.  Before long, I was inside to grab these new gloves.  We were outside for a couple hours, working and shivering but my hands stayed warm.Most importantly, my fingers stayed warm.  That is totally rare. I live in Minnesota and sometimes it gets cold.  It's hard to be outside and keep my fingers warm without wearing two or three pairs of gloves and mittens.  Now, clearly, I have a nice, warm pair of gloves here.These gloves will be the ones I use when I shovel the driveway, or even go check the mail.  These gloves are bit bigger than my hands but I'm wondering if I may need that for a warm liner for when it gets cold.  The inside is so cosy and warm, though.I'm so happy to have warm fingers today.  These are really good gloves.  They look cool too.

This is a great, and safe, alternative to fire candles.All 24 of these  tea lights work very well.  I tried everyone of them.

"These case are really nice and pretty too.  The outside is smooth but the texture from the inside shows through and it looks cool.The edges are frosted all the way around, for a better grip.  The design is octagonal with clear lines separating them. The octagons are sparkly on inside and outside. The inside is textured.The cutouts and buttons are just right and the Apple window is clear.

"For $10.99 headphones, these are pretty good.  No, they are not the quality of some of the famous name brand headphones but they don't carry the big price, either.  At this price point, these headphones are a steal.  I am quite happy with the sound that comes from them.To check out the bass I listened to some of John Carpenter's horror music.  Lots of bass there and it came through very well.  I listened to a mix of highs and lows with Phantom of the Opera and then I listened to a mix of music I have on my phone.I sort of forgot I was checking out these headphones and just enjoyed the music.  I have had these headphones (the ear buds)  in my ears for hours two days in a row.  The volume will get very loud, with no distortion or interference.  There was no crackling or anything from the cables.Can I tell the difference between these and the $100. headphones I have?  Sure I can.

"I have been using loofah pads for years.  I love how my skin feels after a thorough scrubbing then a gentle wash.  I have not had a back scrubber though.  Usually, I bend and stretch and am happy to get to what I can.This back scratcher is different.  It is easily long enough to get to any area of my body.  It feels very good on my back.  It softens quickly in the shower and holds soap because of the sponge type material on the other side.This loofah does look different than others I have used.  This is more of an open weave.  It still feels good though.  Really good.  The smaller loofah is good for the easier to reach parts of the body.  I use liquid soap and it's very easy to get a good lather going with both of the loofah.This is a nice part of pampering that we all deserve.  It's easy to use.

She has made cake pops before but the mold was not silicone and it was not pink.She had a recipe to use, one is not included, so she got busy baking while we chilled.  After awhile, she brought us each a cake pop and a report.  She said the mold worked well.  She didn't spray it because her recipe calls for enough butter, she didn't think she needed to add anything else.  The little cake balls came out while.She was able dunk them in the candy frosting she uses and still they held up.  The mold was put it the dishwasher to clean and it did come out just fine.

"I am thrilled to have this solar panel charger.  This will be wonderful for when hiking and camping.  No problem keeping the phone and tablet charged.What I am thinking is the best use for this solar charger is this winter, and future winters.  When the power goes out, the battery backups I have will be wonderful, until the charge is gone.  This one works on light power.  It's so easy to charge this charger up.  I literally lay it down, or lean it, panel side up.I am so excited to know regardless of the weather, I will be able to keep my phone charged.  The last time we lost power it was for three days and nights.  The only power source we had was the car and we couldn't go anywhere because the roads were icy.  That was horrible but now, thanks to this solar charger, I won't have to waste gas just to charge our phones.The flashlight works very well and will also come in handy for camping, hiking and in case of power loss.The blue lights, that show charge, are only lit up while the solar charger is charging.  Just turn it over to turn the lights off.  This is a must have item for us northerners or anyone that has ever lost the electricity to their home.

"Excellent quality wireless headset. Phone calls are clear, music is clear and stereo quality.Setting the headset up was very easy.  In fact, it took less time to connect it to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge) than it did to get it out of the package.  The packaging is protective for the headset yet a nice display for easy viewing.The headset is nearly three inches long and not even an inch wide.  The outside does have leather that looks good and feels good too.  Mine came with an extra silicone bud, ear hook and two rotatable hooks.  Also a usb charging cable.  The body is made of silicone or hard plastic but it looks like metal, to me.The headset was super easy to connect to my phone. There was no waiting, for me, because my phone found the headset before I got to the settings.  The multi function button is easy to press and does the job for me.  I was able to make a couple phone calls, which sounded as well as just talking on the phone.  Then a couple quick presses and I had the music going again.Music sounds clear and has a full range of sound.  I do not get any interference from my hair, moving around, nothing.A favorite part of this headset is that it is small.  It is comfortable and not in the way of anything.  I can still wear glasses and a hat and they are unaffected by the headset and vice versa.This headset would make a wonderful Christmas gift.  Get hands back on the steering wheel where they belong.

"Wow.  Music from my phone sounds so good in these headphone.  Surprisingly, to me anyway, the music sounds just as good from my Kindle.  I have found a new way to use it.  Usually, I have the tv on for background noise.  Now, I am an active listener.  These headphones are my new best friend.They are comfortable.  I had to get used to them though.  I usually wear earphones when I am outside or working out.  I do enjoy not having anything shoved in my ears.  Don't get me wrong, I really like some of the earphones I have, but these headphones are like five steps beyond the earphones.  With the earphones, the music is in my head and after awhile I don't like that.  I just need a break.  With these headphones, I am enjoying the music but it is noninvasive.  I like this better because I can hear it more clearly and it's more enjoyable.I was listening to opera earlier today.  Wow.  It sounds amazing.  Of course, I don't want to do anything but listen then.  Currently, it's Barry Manilow.  Yes, I like him and his music sounds great.

Not yet, at least.I especially like the little cubbies that will hold my serums and face creams.  Plus the essential oils we like to keep with us.  I really like these items, well all liquid items, to stay upright.  With this bag, no problems.We can keep toothbrushes, toothpaste, larger bottles of shampoo, deodorant, floss.  Well, this list goes on.There is mesh and straps to hold everything in place.  There are even two mesh pockets with zippers.The best feature is the hook.  It hangs up and everything we need is right there.  I really like to be organized when we travel.  It drives me nuts to have to search for something.  This way, we have it all right there.I plan on keeping this travel organizer with my bag.  Pack them both at the same time.  Lately, I have not been taking everything I wanted because I wasn't happy with my system.  Now, I get to take whatever I want.  Yes!I know I'm gushing, but I really like this bag.Discount or sample provided for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZVB7ALIKQG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CPL028#wasThisHelpful","RZZVB7ALIKQG4","A2CSUBM1565NGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CSUBM1565NGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bra is a pretty shade of light pink.  It is made from  nylon and spandex  and very stretchy and soft.  There are no seams in the cups for a more natural look but the support on the inside sides does help create a little cleavage.The pads can stay in place or be removed.  The straps are the usual with the adjustment in the back.  And the clip to lower the cup is in front.It's really a very nice, soft comfy bra.  Not required for nursing moms only.  It does seem to run a bit small, though.

"The handle at the top is big enough for a clip to attach to a backpack.  My favorite feature is the straw.  I love that it folds down into the lid to stay clean.  Press the button and it releases the latch so the straw can come up for use.  Press the straw down and then press the latch to lock it back down.The bottle is stainless steel.  I remember using stainless steel products quite a bit before plastic became so popular.  The best qualities of stainless steel, and this bottle, is it is extremely sturdy.  It does keep liquids hot or cold much longer than plastic.  Especially since this bottle is double walled.Bad quality is, it does sweat.  Air temperature versus bottle temperature and all.  I get past the science by using a cozie. Problem solved.Good bottle that I recommend.

"We can't use these at our house.  We live in the country on some acreage and could definitely use this mouse trap.  We have mice in the barn and some other little creature with claws that scare me.  Unfortunately, we also have dogs, cats and chickens that go the same places as the unwanted little beasts.My sister-in-law has the rodent problem in her porch and no sweet pets to get caught in the glue.  So, we took these traps to her to use.  These trap are bigger than expected.  I can see they would be big enough to catch a rat (eeww)  and the glue is pretty sticky.  I didn't open it because I am a bit klutzy and didn't want the glue on me.  Sis had no problem opening and setting it out with no glue on skin issues.She did catch a mouse in the night.  She called us to say she had her neighbor pull the mouse off the glue.  She wasn't sure if it was ok or not, but it was gone from her porch.  She put the same glue trap back down to reuse.So, yes, they work.

"This is a very sturdy, pet car seat cover.  I really like the feel of the cover.  It won't catch toe nails or let the nails tear the cover.  The material is tough enough to hold up to German Shepherds and Chihuahuas.Installation is easy around the headrest but this also has the best feature, non slip dots on the bottom section.  It helps keeps the cover in place so it is not pulling so tight on the straps.  There are also anchor handles that can be hooked down inside the backseat.  They thought of the little, yet big deal things, with this cover.I had another one of these covers but the straps eventually tore from the weight and activity in the back seat.  But it did not have these additional features.  The non slip section is my favorite feature.  I love that this seat cover also protects my cars leather seats from doggie toe nails.My seat cover came with an unpleasant odor and a few hours outside in the breeze blew it away.

"Wonderful little stove. The weather is unseasonably nice these days. Our fall has been great so we are still hiking quite abit. How nice to hike the bluffs for a couple hours then take a break and make some hot tea.This stove is tiny. About three inches, or so, tall. It is super easy to use, even I got this one figured out very quickly. It goes on top of the butane-propane canister and that's it for installation. There is the valve to turn on, off and adjust the gas flow. An ignition switch and a place to set a pan or pot.This stove leaves no mess behind, so no cleanup and we have left the land how we found it.

"The first thing you will notice right away about this bag is the exterior, it's leather, which IMO is a better choice then vinyl or canvas giving this bag an immediate advantage.Another plus is the interior composition has a core wrapped in foam, and this is going to make your hits a bit more safe if you plan to not wear any protective gear on your hands or feet, although if you are new to using a heavy bag I would strongly recommend investing in some protective gear, especially if your looking at jumping into MMA.Provided with the bag is a set of heavy chains allowing this to be hung easily with proper installation on a strong support system. I'd really make sure that the structure you plan to hang this on is properly equipped to handle the weight of the bag, especially over time. While this is a great bag for home use, proper installation and support can really be the deciding factor of preventing some long term damage to your home, so do your research before hanging.Overall this is a great bag for a home gym, or small private gym that should provide you with years of use before succumbing to the inevitable after being worn out. There's not really anything here that I can write that would be a negative, and it's really priced very nice considering the quality of the bag.Very much recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S870L0SN3QBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K410MW#wasThisHelpful","R3S870L0SN3QBH","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OtterBox is simply put the best protection for your smartphone and there's absolutely no debate, if you're going to protect your device always go with OtterBox. There may be cheap knock offs that look like an OtterBox, but there really is only one OtterBox and you're taking a HUGE risk by going another route. Why would you?The SYMMETRY Cell Phone Case for the Samsung is going to give you the insurance, style, and access to function that you need, and that your device deserves. If you risk going cheap by getting a knock off that pretends to be an alt to OtterBox, you're basically saying that you'd rather gamble your $700 device then spend a little more to get the real deal. Don't do it, get the OtterBox. I made that mistake of going cheap a few years back, and I will never do that again because it cost me a lot more then a few extra dollars to replace my phone.

This also leads into the ease of storage and hold it folds up so it's not taking up space when it's not in use.The cradle itself is also well made and ensures confidence that your little bundle of joy is well protected with fear or worry that the cradle will break down while in use or over time.Bravo!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3OLWYOA9UL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRB3NTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2G3OLWYOA9UL9","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about Turtle Beach headsets and my experience with them over the years is consistency! Every single one I have owned except for one, has always impressed and this new entry is no different especially if you are budget conscience, but still want a rich gaming audio experience.The new Recon delivers excellent sound, and a great feature of being able to have mic control on the PS4/PS3 so you can hear yourself in the headset. Sounds were full and have plenty of bass.I also used these on the Xbox One and they work without any additional add-ons sans the Xbox One headset adapter which is sold separately and is specific to the Xbox One as being a needed item to use 3rd party headsets. The only feature not available by using it with the Xbox One as a plug and play is the mic ability with being able to hear yourself, that feature is specific to the Sony systems because you will need the adapter that IS included here only for the Sony systems.My only word of caution is that this headset is a snug fit, and for me having a small head that is perfect but some with a larger head could run into discomfort issues, so a little word of caution here. However after gaming with these for some pretty long sessions I found no personal discomfort.Excellent job Turtle Beach!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LPFX1DE8F7HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UI6#wasThisHelpful","R3LPFX1DE8F7HK","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After a few uses I can say the mop does work as expected and I really do like the way it purges the dirty water to drain and clean the mop dry after first coat on the kitchen floor. The spinning function of plunging the mop works better then expected, and the mop itself holds a decent amount of water for first coat.I did not experience any leaking from the bucket as some have so that's good.The mop itself detaches easily for throwing into the laundry and held up in that test too.My only real complaint is that the way the two buckets attach and keeping them together does not always work out and I had more then one occasion where the two adjoining parts separated which was annoying. I wish there was a locking feature on the buckets the way there is on the mop itself to prevent it from pushing down to prevent that from happening so I have to be more mindful when picking the bucket up after full.Other then that one minor flaw, I do like the mop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJRIR36GV9MGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","RJRIR36GV9MGF","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am gonna be honest, before the camera arrived I had low expectations, and it was not because of the reviews but just prior experience using a camera that promised what the Myfox does and not delivering. Let me tell you up front, YES this works exactly as described and was above and beyond my expectations.First off lets talk about the size. The camera is much smaller (happy about this) then what I was expecting when the box arrived. The camera itself can fit in the palm of your hand and it's very well made.Set up is extremely easy.*plug it in*download the MyFox security app*set up the account*activate*start monitoringThat's it.Side note. MyFox also comes with power adapters for various country requirements, meaning you could take this with you on a trip to Europe and use it in a hotel abroad if they have WiFi to monitor your hotel room. I kid you not, it has 4 attachments enclosed and this was a pleasant surprise and IMO this makes it great having for the traveling business person or family vacation. That being said it was easy to find the proper attachment for US outlets and assemble by snapping into place.How's the video quality? AMAZING! Clear as can be on my Samsung Note, and I can even hear the audio in the room! There are also options on the app to go backwards and view footage from moments before, save, or screen capture! You can also zoom in by simply using your fingers on your smartphone to widen the shot. The aspect ratio FYI is widescreen with a fish eye on the outer edges.I also tested the night vision, and again - knocked it out of the park!There's really not one negative thing to say here except, I wish I had more then one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5JEQI5EDJQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWBURWI#wasThisHelpful","R2S5JEQI5EDJQ9","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price point this is a very good helmet and the fact that it's solar powered for me is a huge plus. I had no issues so far with any flashing and the helmet fits perfectly on my head. I should say however, I do have a small head and I could see the potential that if you have a larger sized head this could be a bit of a tighter fit for some.The lens area is a bit bigger then your standard job helmet.There is no grind mode, but that's not really a big deal to me so you will be switching on your own.My only concern which is not enough to knock it down a star is that I can see the potential after a lot of use that the shiny black coat will wear out, but that's a cosmetic issue and does not impact the main purpose of the helmet. It's not a fashion statement, it's protection and so far it does that very very well.I will update my review later on after some solid time with it but so far I cannot find any real negative as to why you should not buy this helmet considering the cost is very reasonable and it gets the job done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7R652S428OX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFJLRD4#wasThisHelpful","R1G7R652S428OX","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow! I have owned a Forman Grill before, the smaller ones when they first hit the market which I loved before it finally outlived it's usefulness. This grill however blows that out of the water for many reasons. First of which this is a full sized grill which means that you can prepare more food and it eliminates the need of using a grill that requires charcoal or gas which IMO is better. Why? Well you can use this grill literally inside the house, you could never do that with an outside grill. This means year round use rather then use just during the warmer months.Now lets talk about the assembly. At first glance when you remove everything from the box it may seem a bit overwhelming, but once you realize where everything goes (I did this without even looking at the guide FYI), it's extremely easy and quick to put together. You will need a phillips head for the cover.Cooking is a breeze to, I made burgers and for me I am on the Atkins diet so I had been using the outdoor grill which required a whole process of cleaning with the brush, turning on the gas, using a lighter, etc. With the Foreman you simply plug it in, turn up the heat, place your food on and within mins you have perfectly cooked burgers! The other advantage the grill has is the same advantage the smaller grill has, it removes a large portion of the fat from the burgers making them a more healthy choice then using the standard grill.Another advantage the Foreman has over a a gas or charcoal how easy this is to clean which I wanted to reemphasize. You simply pop off the grill from the base after unplugging the power cable and wipe it down in the sink with warm soapy water using a soft cloth and dry it off with a soft or paper towel. No grill needed or steel brush.You can also pop the grill off the stand and use it on a heat safe surface, which also means when you are ready to store the grill after use break down is as simple as setting it up.Save money on propane, and no more messy charcoal!This grill is awesome.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCFV95HKX6YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRH3HA#wasThisHelpful","R3DCFV95HKX6YT","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GolfBuddy is simply put, an amazing device that will improve your game tremendously by doing some very useful things, and I am gonna break it down for you.Lets go over the key features of what it does*Precise yardages - displays front, middle and back yardages of the green, wherever you are on the course*Dynamic green view and pin placement - the user can alter the yardages based on where the pin is located on the green*Digitial scorecard - allows you to keep track of scores*Shot tracking - find out far you really hit that drive*Auto-course and hole recognition - turn it on and head straight to the first teeIt works from the first time you turn it on as you approach the course by logging you in as you approach, but the real magic of the GoldBuddy is it's ability to pinpoint yardages to the front, middle and back of the green from the golfer's angle of approach by simply looking at your wrist.You can even track your shot to see how far your drives are going.Want to dial in yardage to the flag?

"This is a fantastic tooth brush and idea to get kids in brushing after every meal mode. It makes brushing the teeth a fun experience instead of a chore. This does require you to own a smartphone or capable device however in order to make use of the app associated with the tooth brush and after awhile of course you can ween your child off the app and into just using the brush itself which is perfectly built for their teeth and hands.Lets talk about the brush itself a little bit. The brush does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth with the perfect amount of strokes to get into those hard to reach places that little hands may have a hard time cleaning on their own without the aid of the stroke. Just enough power in the charge to get the job done leaving the little pearly whites glistening, even after a hefty chocolate cone. As far as the strokes, we're talking 500 brush strokes per second. The other major benefit is the timer that used to lets kids know how long they need to be brushing those teeth, teaching them that you don't stop until the brush does! Excellent feature IMO.Being rechargeable also means, no batteries needed and the recharge time is generous enough that you do not have to worry about the brush kicking out after just a few uses incase it's not been placed back onto the charger after usage so you'll get many brushes in before it kicks out.Now lets talk about the app. Is it a gimmick? Yeah, sure but your kid does know that or care. It walks them through the process of how to properly brush in a fun easy method that will ensure your kid is on the proper path to healthy clean teeth without you having to be the bearer of implementing this as a chore.All in all this is a solid product from Phillips that I can easily recommend as a great introduction for your child to the world of brushing their teeth on their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QT9ZQKEU5ZHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7ZL6#wasThisHelpful","R2QT9ZQKEU5ZHP","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Worth every single penny and then some. Elixir continues it's tradition with quality strings and I have not one negative thing to offer here. Any bass player will tell you that the sound you get is not just the guitar, the amp, or the player, it's all of that, but having a solid set of strings is just as important as all the other pieces and can be the deciding factor of if you are getting the most out of sound.These strings are great on the fingers, and great on the pick. I play both ways depending on the song and style. They have a very cool look to them that are a little brighter then the average strings and sound wise they will provide that nice smooth phat mellow sound for the finger, or the bright pluck off the pick ala Peter Hook (New Order).All in all I can highly recommend these to my fellow musicians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RL48PJ03T2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU6JL8#wasThisHelpful","R30RL48PJ03T2S","A1E110L9ZKX6FD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E110L9ZKX6FD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And for when my friends with young children are over. I put them on the cabinets down low to keep the kids and animals out.They are easy for an adult, or older child to operate, but hard enough for a younger child to not be able to operate.I received the 2 pack, but I will be ordering more, and I suggest them to everyone I Know now.These also attach to the cabinet very well, and don't seem like they are going to come off anytime soon, if ever.Overall I recommend these.I received these for free for the purpose of an honest review.

"I LOVE these headbands. I do love that there are four in a pack. I lose them (more like the cats take off with them, or my daughter steals them) like crazy.These have a non-slip lining of silicone on the inside, so that they don't slide near as easily as any other headband that I have used. They stretch easily, but they don't stretch out, if you get what I""m trying to explain.They hold when my hair is straightened or when it's curly, when it's a mess and just needs to be out of my face. They fit me and my daughter both very well, without any issues at all.They come in four colors, so you aren't stuck with just one. You can get a fourpack mix, or just pick a certain color.I find that they do slide a little bit, through the day, but not near as much as a hairband that doesn't have the non slip grip inside of them.Overall I recommend these hair bands, and I would purchase more.I received these at a discount for the purpose of an honest review.

"These rings are fantastic for anyone who works in a field where having a real ring could cause an issue. My husband works in the oil field, and if he were to get his ring caught, it could deglove his finger, or worse.I will make a note here that these rings run small. I ordered a size 10 because that is what my husband wears. However, it doesn't fit his fingers at all. It's about a size too small, and I am betting an 11 would fit him just right. They aren't quite stretchy enough to force it onto his finger.Otherwise, these are great rings. You get two colors, so your man could wear either one, or you could each wear one that is a different color if you wear the same size.They are plain and simple, so if they do get caught on something, and torn up, they are easy to replace if needed.Overall I recommend these rings, just be mindful of the size.I received these for free for the purpose of an honest review.

No more getting that disgusted look when I tell them it's time.I can give them their vitamins, with no added flavor to whatever food I put the vitamins in.There is absolutely no way to tell that these are in their food!There are 90 - 1/4 teaspoon servings per container, so this will last a while in our house.Overall I recommend this for those who have trouble getting their kids to take vitamins!I received this for free for the purpose of an honest review.

" 3:02 Mins I LOVE LOVE LOVE this set. I am an EO FREAAAAKKKK, and was so happy to get this case.The wooden case is made very well, and sturdy. The hinges and latch are golden, which look rather classy on the plain wooden box. The only design on the box i the doTerra name. You could always woodburn, or paint, or draw on it if you wished to change it up a little.Inside the box is dividers so that you can add longer bottles if you want to, rather than the standard 5-15mL bottles that it normally holds. It can hold up to 25 of these bottles.It also comes with a 'togo' pouch and 8 - 5/8 dram bottles. So that if you wish to take some of your EOs with you, you can easily do so. Just fill the dram bottles, and place them in the to go pouch and be on your merry little way. The pouch can clip onto anything you want with the included carbiner clip as well. It comes in two colors, black and purple, so those who don't wnt the 'girly' purple color, can have black.The box and the carry pouch are both very well made and will withstand the wear and tear you put them through.Overall I highly recommend this box set to anyone on the market for an EO storage case.I received this at a discount for the purpose of an honest review.

"This is a cute little, but fairly loud alarm clock.The pink is bright and vibrant and made my daughter extremely happy.I feel that this will last quite some time with my daughter, even with the wear and tear, because of the silicone cover.This is battery powered, so you can pack it with you and take it anywhere you go.It also has a snooze function for those who are like me or my daughter and slap that alarm a few times every morning LOL.There is a night light on it, So that you can see around the room.

"My son fell in love with these headphones immediately when we received them. He stole them from me the second I tried them out to make sure they work well.They easily connected to my phone and to his phone. I have also tried my tablet, and they worked on it well also.They come with different ear covers, so you can put the ones in that fit your ear better. My son wears a smaller pair than I do.The bright blue is pretty IMO, but my son likes that it's a boy-ish color and he doesn't have to worry about anyone making fun of the color he is carrying.He officially carries them with him EVERYWHERE he goes, so that he can listen to music on his phone.The sound is full of life, and crisp and clear.Overall I recommend these, and so does my son.I received these for free for the purpose of an honest review.

"I adore this little detangler brush! It's the PERFECT size for fitting into my purse, or my handbag. I have tried so many that were fantastic, but just too big and bulky to carry around with me. This is a bit smaller than the palm of my hand, but it is easy to hang onto.The colors are bold and bright and just make me smile whenever I see them.The brush REALLY works to get the tangles out of my hair without any issues at all.It is super easy to get the hair out of this when I am done brushing my hair, and when I use this, it doesn't take out as much of my hair as a regular brush.

"This item is so good I don't know where to start. This new release is completly loaded with a TON of new features and capabilities that you can't find in other chargers.PRO's:1. Very Easy to use if you'e familiar with Balance chargers. I opened the box and tested out every feature of this supply without even reading the manual.2. Bright, clear easy to read backlit oversized (good) resolution Touch screen Display with adjustable brightness and contrast.3.  Built-in AC to DC Power supply that can also be powered off a 12 volt source. No need to buy 12V power supply or a Big 12V Battery.4.  Built in Current and Voltage Regulated Programable Power Supply worth $80-100 on its own. You read that right.  Not only can it charge batteries but It can power other items directly from this device. The built in programable power supply limits are 1-28 Volts,  1-10 Amps  and 10-80 Watts with a 10 Hour limit. This means you can power most items from 1- 28 Volts that takes under 80 Watts as long as it draws 10 Amps or less. It does have some limitations. If you want to test out a low amperage LED without a regulator you'll run into  problems  as you can't limit current to under 1 Amp, or 10 Watts but you can Voltage limit it.5. 18 Easy to store programable memories Plus one extra for your last charging parameters.6. Built in 6 cell Battery Tester that will test  for both Voltage and Internal Resistance. With the high resolution display you can see the results of 6 cells simultaneously.7.) 5 Volt 3 Amp USB Power Supply that also has a ""full page"" of features including Current, Voltage, Capacity, Watt Hour and Run time display. This will allow you to charge and test the capacity of all your Rechargeable USB devices. Example. Wondering what the battery capacity of your iPhone is? Discharge it 100% then charge it on this charger. It will show you the the total energy it took to charge the IPhone. Volts, Current, Capacity, Watt Hours, Current Charging Watts  and total charging time. An added bonus is that the output tested at 5.26 Volts.8. It's built in fan is 100% completely SILENT as it stays off until it's needed. Seems to trigger at approximately 50 Watts. I love silent Power supplies.9. You can charge LIPo, Li-Ion, LiFE cells ""WITH"" balance leads or ""WITHOUT"". YES this charger allows charging packs of cells without the Balance Leads connected. It does test for Input voltage, Main charging port connection and Balance lead connections when you hit start but it will it will allow you charge without balance if you want to.10. Built in Discharger allowing up to 10 watts total.11. Built in NiCad and NiMh cycler (sorry I haven't tested this feature yet)12. Fully customization of the charging characteristics of each battery type. You can pick not only the amperage and total Amp Hour limits but you can adjust the cutoff voltage (High and Low) of each cell. No more being forced into what the charger thinks you should terminate the charge voltage at.13. Built in speaker for end of charge alarm, button presses and confirmations. Safety timer up to 10 hours, Built in programable temperature cutoff on the charger and battery using a  thermistor (not included)14 Nixx Cycle, Delta, Waste time, DeltaV control on NiMH and NiCd cells15. Built in Servo Tester16. Full Bar Graph display allowing x-y plot access when charging and discharging batteries. Not as good as graphing to your computer but great then one is not available.17. External USB port so you can add the optional $8 TENERGY PC BATTERY MONITOR SOFTWARE KIT FOR BALANCE CHARGERS. Example: http://www.onlybatterypacks.com/product/tenergy-pc-battery-monitor-software-kit-for-balance-chargers-tb6b-tb6ac-tb6ac4/This software allows you to monitor charging status (input/output voltage capacity current Power) display cell voltage of a pack individually record the data over a period of time and plot into graphs18. Firmware updatable if you have the optional $8 Monitor software kit.CONS:  The programable power supply for some reason has a 600 minute 10 hours limit. It would be nice if you could power item's indefinitely. The programmable power supply can't be ""Current"" limited to under 1 Amp. Meaning if you wanted to current limit an unregulated LED to 100 Mah's you can't without using Voltage limiting.Overall this charger is simply the most featured balance charger you can buy anywhere at this price range and . Build in AC to DC, Built in Programable power supply, Huge Backlit display with Bar Graph, the ability to charge all types of batteries with or without balance cables and endless new features really do set this item apart from the crowd.

"Overall they are a good product with the LED's under-driven so they won't get at all hot allowing for a very long run time. The manufacturer claims they have a 13 lumen capacity but that's actually incorrect and it's much more then this. Each of the 5 SMT White 5050 LED's inside each bulb is capable of producing 13 lumens (each) so each bulb could produce over 60 Lumens. Remember these are a Cold White at 8,000 K (kelvin) so they will be not match your 2,800-3,000 K incandescent reading light or stock 4,200 K HID lights. If you want nice warm lighting to read by or in a motorhome these will be ""too cool white"" and a 3000K bulb would be better.Overall these are at a great at the low price point, should last a very long time and as long as you use them in the correct application they should fulfill the bill.

"I've owned over 30 Solar powered lights over the years and really like some of the unique features of this one making it my new favorite. I also have much bigger and more expensive solar lights but this one beats them out in features and practicality. First off when I opened the box I instantly noticed that it had a little more weight for such a small light. Actually the battery inside is larger then my $40-50 Solar lights. Inside it has an accessible and removable 3.7 volt 18650 1500mAh Li-ion inside. So when the battery dies out 3-5 years from now like it will. You can simply drop in a new 18650 cell without tearing the light apart and re-soldering in some proprietary flat hard to find li-poly cell that costs more then the light. That alone makes this light a great value.18650's are cheap and easily available. Stating at $2 each on Amazon and will give you about 300-500 full charge discharge cycles or and maybe 1000-1500 day night cycles as your light usually won't run out at night. You can even drop in a high end Panasonic 3,400mAh 18650 NCR18650B that will give you over double the capacity.Most of my other solar lights come with a ridiculous tiny little pin hole and pin to turn the light on and in only one position. I always hated that idea as if you have a power outage you can just move one or more of your solar lights indoors for emergency lighting. My other lights might work in a power outage but they will be constantly turning on and off or getting dimmer brighter with motion. That's great outdoors but not if you want to read a book. This one has a nice easy to use 4 position switch on the back. Not only does it have a switch but the switch is useful. You can set it to be on continuously on a lower brightness. Or Low/High when someone walks by. Or completely OFF and then it turns ON high if it detects motion and OFF again in 15 seconds. Since the battery is accessible and this light has a full time ON feature you can use it as an emergency indoor light for many days if you have some spare 18650 batteries.As for the light output. It's very bright  (I didn't test it with my photometric integrating sphere) the 160 Lumen rating seems accurate.  The LED's project a perfect WHITE light with no blueish or greenish tint that most solar lights have. The color Temperate looks about 4,500 Kelvin, about the color temperature of a vehicles factory HID lights or 300 Kelvin higher. The LED's have a great CRI or Coloring Color Rendering Index. Out of all 30+ of my Solar lights this is the only one that gives off a natural looking light that is spot on. It's also  surprisingly bright for it's 8 LED size and beats all my 16 LED solar lights and is equal to my 20 LED Solar lights.As for the solar panel. This is a smaller solar light with a proportionally smaller solar panel. In no way can it gather as much sun as my much bigger lights but the larger battery makes up for it some as it can store more reserve. The Motion sensor is claimed to work at a crazy 26 foot long max distance and 10-16 feet high. I haven't tested those claims as mine are only 10 feet high.I also haven't had it long enough to do full charge/discharge cycles so I can't say of the solar panel has the surface area to handle the light when subject to frequent battery draining motion detection. What ever you do you really need to mount Solar lights in the best spot to gather sun light year round. If you don't, after a few days of use you'll notice the lights will cut off later at night.If this is your first solar light you might want to attach it with velcro. 8-10 feet high is plenty. This will allow you to quickly detach it and use it as an indoor lantern during a power failure or even camping. If you like that idea of using this as a dual purpose camping/emergency indoor light you can pickup 4 spare 18650's (with twice the capacity) and a charger stating at in $9 total. http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=18650  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WOIRZYTGW6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0171NQFK2#wasThisHelpful","R8WOIRZYTGW6A","A2FGFD21RCWP13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FGFD21RCWP13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a chance to test these cables out on my new iPhone 6s Plus 128gb that just arrived today and surprisingly they beat out Apple's on cables in how fast they can charge the new iPhones. Most of us want our phones to charge as quickly as possible. Nobody want's to wait hours for their phone to finish charging. I'll tell you how to Charge your cell phone in half the time below but it will come at a cost.First off Apple ""intentionally"" ships out a horribly slow charger and cable setup with it's top of the line Phones. Don't get me wrong I love my new Plus but Apple intentionally reduced the charge rate on their charger/cable combo to HALF the phones charge rate capabilities. The reason Apple is shipping out slow chargers is to maximize the charge cycles the battery can receive before the capacity is shot. This prevents endless warranty claims and phones that have wrecked batteries in the first 1-2 years.Battery life is greatly influenced by the charging rate. There is a limitation as to how quickly the Lithium ions can enter into the intercalation layers of the anode. Trying to force too much current through the battery during the charging process results in surplus ions being deposited on the anode in the form of Lithium metal. Known as Lithium plating, this results in an irreversible capacity loss.Charging a typical cell phone Li-Ion battery at a slower C2 rate can almost double the batteries service life compared to charging it at C1 or twice as fast so Apple bundled the new phones with a tiny 5 watt charger. A charger that can barely put out more then one Amp at the peak portion of the charging cycle. This will allow the Li-ion cells to take closer to 500 cycles before dropping down in  the 80-90% capacity range. Now charge the cells twice as fast and you can end up with a battery that in just 250 cycles holds less then 50% of it's original capacity. At that point the phone becomes almost unusable. See my random attached li-ion C rate image to get an idea of what I'm talking about here.OK so what about these Zakix cables I'm reviewing here? They use a thicker Gauge wire and work surprisingly well. With a better 2.4amp  USB charger you can Charge your iPhone in HALF the time.For example in my images I have a brand new  iPhone 6s Plus 128gb that was just released today. It's using the stock Apple USB charger and apples stock cable. In the images you'll see that the chargers voltage is already sagging to 4.67 volts at 1.18 Amps for a total of 5.51 Watts.Now I switch over to the lower resistance Zakix cable that I'm reviewing here and a better USB charger that can handle over 2 Amps with out the voltage sag. The output is now 5.26 Volts at 2.06 Amps for a total of 10.83 Watts. So now my new iPhone is charging at almost DOUBLE the speed of the stock Apple Charger/Cable setup.Conclusion.  All 3 of these cables work perfectly for the newest iPhones. They feel solid, they look good and they allow a faster charge then Apples own cable. Will they last? Who knows but for $3 each they are great fast charging cables.I took the time so that you guys can weigh out the benefits of Fast charging and the resulting shorter battery lifespan. I fast charge and I'm willing to swap the battery out in a couple of years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHGDRH19IG8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEIWKQK#wasThisHelpful","R2MHGDRH19IG8J","A2FGFD21RCWP13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FGFD21RCWP13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shimano is finally replacing it's well proven XT PD-M780 SPD Mountain Bike Pedal line released in 2011 with the new Shimano Deore XT M8000 SPD race pedals. Physically they're a slightly more refined version of the M780's. The M8000's are ""claimed"" by Shimano to offer increased stability by increasing the Platform contact area width of the M780 by 2.8mm. Shimano ""claims"" this increased pedal-to-shoe contact area also improves efficiency. The stack height of the platform is also .5mm lower then the M780's allowing a ""very slight"" increase in ground clearance to help avoid pedal strikes .5mm is about 1/50th of an inch so I don't think it will be noticeable.As for the weight they are virtually identical to the older M780's 169.6 grams each.I weighed these M8000's in at 169.5 grams each. (339 grams for the pair) [Not counting cleats] See images:While these are racing Mountain Bike pedals you can also pair them up with mountain bike shoes for use with your road bike.Mountain Bike Shoes have a fairly stiff sole for efficient pedaling, but have enough flex and a rubber-lug outsole to allow good traction for walking on slick or rugged trails. The cleats on mountain bike shoes are typically recessed into the soles so that you don't walk on the metal cleats. This makes for much easier walking and you can usually walk on your homes wood floors without destroying the wood. Mountain bike shoes are a popular choice for more casual road biking, touring and indoor cycling classes as well. Personally I also use mountain bike shoes 95% of the time on my Trek Madone road bike. With mountain bike shoes you can make bathroom stops, go shopping or even take a hike without the ridiculously impossible chore of trying to walk on the back of road shoes. ""clank clank clank"". With mountain bike shoes if you break down on your road or mountain bike you can still walk home without a problem. I've walked about 20 feet in the road shoes, took them off and just went barefoot instead of destroying the shoes. I've also walked 10+ miles in mountain bike shoes in a day when several spokes broke. I pretty much only use road bike shoes in racing situations.Pros:(1) These are the refined and updated version of the M780's with no price increase.(2) Relatively light weight at (339 grams for the pair)(3) Slighter wider shoe contact area  (7.7mm) allowing for a ""claimed"" increase in comfort and pedaling efficiency(4) Very slight increase in stability and ground clearance to help avoid pedal strikes due to the stack height being .5mm lower.(5) The bearings are much better than the lower end Shimano pedals.(6) They come with two Shimano SM-SH51 Cleats but will also work with the optional SM-SH56 Cleats if you need(7) The tension can be set in 20 increments. Each click can be felt and is 1/4 turn or 90 degrees in rotation.Cons:(1) The Pedal Wrench Type is a [hex] 8 mm. This larger size allows the ability to use more torque to remove the pedals but ""some"" saddle bag tool kit's are limited to 6mm(2) The clip-in tension setting seemed to be randomly adjusted as shipped from the factory. One Pedal side was set at 5 from loosest, the other side 13 from the loosest.  The other pedal was 7 and 9 from loosest.Anyone new to riding an SPD-style pedal should adjust the tension to the loosest (-) setting to get a feel for using them. Practice unclipping 50-100 times with each foot and work the tension up if you find you're unclipping unexpectedly. It's best to error a little on the loose side until your confident you can unclip without falling.Overall, These are excellent pedals with great bearings that should last many years to come. If you already own the PD-M780's you probably don't need to upgrade but if your ready to buy either the PD-M780 or these Deore XT M8000's then buy the M8000's as they are the mid 2015 update to the older 2011 PD-M780's at roughly the same price.BTW:Shimano makes two types of SPD cleats - ""Single release"" clips the ""normal"" SM-SH51 SPD cleats that you'll find in this box. and the optional multi-release SM-SH56 cleats.With both types of cleats you have to twist your feet to unclip, but the single-release cleats only allow a twist to the side. The SM-SH56 cleats allow a few more angles of release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EBPX373AXX32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMP5CF2#wasThisHelpful","R3EBPX373AXX32","A2FGFD21RCWP13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FGFD21RCWP13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PRO's:These Silicon Devices bluetooth Headphones have a crisp clean sound and surprising bass for such a small package. I found that you can even tune the bass simply by swapping for a smaller or larger size. I also noticed that with the twelve included inserts you can control if these will be closed or open air design to a large degree. While this might not work for you my ears are just the size that when I size down to small these become open air that I prefer as I like to also hear the outside environment more. Even when I went the lower size they still stayed in my ears snuggly with no worries of falling out. Going up a size seals the air and blocks the external sound more.While I don't think these were designed to allow open air listening it worked for me. Open-backed headphones allow air to circulate, which is more comfortable. They also can help give the impression that sound is coming from around you, as opposed to emanating from your corpus callosum, which is a characteristic of closed-back and in-ear headphones. Closed-back models are better at sealing off the outside world, but your ears may get hot from the lack of air circulationWhile my first extended use was with my iPhone I found these also work superbly as a PC or MAC gaming headset. I didn't realize how freeing it would be to not have my headphones connected via the earphone jack or to my Computers USB port. No more cords to rip out and when mountain bike cycling these are a must for me. My iPhone with it's GPS and my Power meter are affixed to waterproof stem mounts so I'm locked in by the cords length. I've broken at least 6 headphones over the last 3 years by ditching my bike (still connected to your ear while the other end is connected to the bike mount) in a jump or by the spokes catching it. I cant even guess how many times over the years Ive knocked one or the other ear buds out of my ear because I accidentally hit the cord.Bluetooth has come a long way in the last couple of years and these are unbelievably light. You would think sound quality would not be as good but these sound better then my much more expensive corded sets. I was offered these at a discount for my review and I was a bit shocked at how far the technology has advanced in the last year or two. When you hear these speak back to you you realize that theres a tiny CPU drawing micro-Watts capable of doing more then the first PC's of the past.These also have a ton of hidden features. Besides the built in human speech prompts, these also can control my iPhone and allow me to jump up and down tracks, pause and even control the volume from my right ear. Pairing was as easy as holding a button down for a few seconds. These also allow pairing of two separate devices so I can switch from my iPhone to my MAC or PC without repairing.I see that these have other functions some I having tried yet like: music playback, pause, skip tracks, last number redial, caller ID and headset operation volume controls. They also compatible with in-car navigation systems.CONS:If I could find faults there are two but they are very minor. The right ear side has a push activated power switch that has a tiny rattle when tapped by accident. This is not noticed when listening, just if you bump the right ears case. Not a big deal.The second fault is the lowest volume setting is not low enough at least with my iPhone. With the IPhone and these Anear's you have about 28 steps in volume. These headphones seem to reach about 120 dB SPL at the loudest setting (way louder then you'll ever need unless you like ear damaging levels) but on normal music and audiobooks with the lowest setting the lowest average db's still seems to be in the 60-70 db range. If your listening to music to sleep or relax another 10-12db lower might be preferred but these headphones don't allow that low a volume.Example of relative sound pressures on the quieter side:Quiet whisper (1 m) 30dbQuiet room 40dbWhispered speech 50dbNormal Conversation 60dbInside a car at 60mph 70dbIf you have an iPhone I found a trick to drop the lowest sound levels about 12db's. Go to ""settings"" then ""music"" and turn ON ""Sound check"" Then turn ON the EQ ""equalizer"" and set it to Loudness. Sound check is meant reduce the volume of music that's recorded with too much modulation but it tends to have about a 6db cut and so does the loudness turned on. The reason loudness drops the average sound pressure on the iphone is because in order to boost the bass it would cause over modulated audio on the boosted frequencies, distortion and the bass would clip. By dropping the average db down your can boost bass without over modulated audio.CONCLUSION:BUY THEM!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WX1WD5ZKFPTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V45K5YQ#wasThisHelpful","R2WX1WD5ZKFPTC","A2FGFD21RCWP13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FGFD21RCWP13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pre-workout supplements are a great example of the ""wild west"" approach to nutrition for weight lifters and various other jocks. There is minimal accurate scientific data to back up the individual agents used in the products and no data for the mixing ratios of the components used for the intended ""indication"".  Most pre-workout supplements are simply various amino acids like Beta Alanine mixed with an assortment of vitamins (typically B vitamins and Niacin) with varying amounts of caffeine to give the workout ""jolt"". I've tried a lot of these products - Spark, Hydro Hit, NVIE and Dymatize to name a few. Insert an ""s"" to the word ""hit"" in Hydro hit and that is the effect it had on me. No wonder it vanished from Amazon.PE1  smells and tastes pretty lousy. It's also a sucralose (Splenda) bomb. The flavor I bought is ""tropical punch"" and it's far worse tasting than the worst fake juice product you've ever tried. PE1 mixes fairly easily in cold water and it does not clump like the now unavailable ""Hydro Hit"" product I had been using. PE1 does provide a decent energy boost for lifting and the product does not induce tachycardia (rapid heart rate) or the ""jitters"" but I use a fairly low dose of the product - 1/2 scoop prior to the gym.In summary, PE1 works OK, is relatively inexpensive compared to most pre-workout products and it tastes lousy.

"Decent inexpensive headphones. For the folks who cannot tell the difference in the three sound inserts, you must be tone deaf. The three screw in music inserts do exactly what is described in the instructions. I liked the track controls higher up near the actual ear bud. The chest level ones stink for the gym if you are doing any forward facing exercise with a chest pad (upright row weight machine comes to mind)  because the contact between the pad/chest and the controller either advances the track or shuts it off.

"This is a quirky hoodie. I'll get to that in a minute. The XL fits me fine but I prefer a tighter fit to a looser fit. I'm sort of large - 6' 1"", 225 pounds with a 48"" chest and a 38"" waist. I've been a weightlifter, hockey player and martial arts practitioner for decades. This H2H hoodie fits snug about the waist and just right around my chest. It's fairly thin and stretchy material - not the thicker, standard no stretch cotton hoodie material.Now for the quirky part. This is not a USA made product - the zipper is on the wrong side and it zips up left handed. I guess that's the better side if you are left handed.  I double checked the description and it says ""Men's"" and it fits like a men's size unless you a size 20 chick who can wear a men's XL. If you don't like left handed zippers, look elsewhere.The other quirk was that the left handed zipper has two slider heads so you can unzip from the top and the bottom. It was a bit hard to engage the zipper slider at first and I could not get the zipper to work at all. I looked closely at the upper slider and it had some excess paint or something binding the slider head. I cleaned it out with a pocket knife blade and it worked fine. I thought about returning the hoodie but I liked the fit, the cut, the length and the quirkiness grew on me and I hate returning stuff. The body is long and I have a long torso so it fit me well.It smells really crummy right out of the bag - that foreign ""sizing smell"". It's a very chemical odor but it was gone with one quick wash.Be aware that when you pull the actual hood over your head, it makes you look like the Grim Reaper and there is no hood drawstring. And there is that zipper thing but quirky and weird suits me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCXL58RSIC3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O44TAKE#wasThisHelpful","R3CCXL58RSIC3N","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cryostim Probes are the device of choice for deep tissue icing that and ice bag and cold packs cannot reach. They are ""targeted icing"" for specific tendon injuries and tendonitis in general and can isolate a spot about the size of a nickel on pulled or irritated tendon. I have had shoulder problems for well over a decade and have had three rotator cuff surgeries. My most recent right shoulder surgery was in 2009 and I had it fully rehabilitated. I aggravated the injury lifting weights in the gym over the summer and really aggravated it this week in a martial arts class.I went to my highly capable chiropractor who identified my shoulder issue as biceps tendonitis or perhaps a slight tear of the biceps tendon with some shoulder capsule damage. He showed me the precise spots on the tendon to ice with these probes and they work much better than general shoulder ice packs. Make sure you use the gel with them - it's a critical component to prevent freezing injury and to allow the probe to move around and target deep tissues like tendons. I have also used these cryostim probes with great success on small burns. Last month some molten solder fell onto my left hand and the probe worked great for treating the affected area.If you are unsure how to use these properly, consult a trained medical professional to best understand how to use these probes for deep tissue icing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWYXI69REDXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052ZWN9O#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWYXI69REDXW","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had about 100 widows to caulk at all different angles inside and outside along with 500 lineal feet of concrete seams that required polyurethane caulk. I grew weary of messing with hand powered caulk guns, especially for the polyurethane, so I sprung for this unit. It has worked great so far (about 40 windows are finished). You just have to be sure to cut the tip opening smaller than you think when you start and cut larger if needed and dial in the flow control based on the caulk. 100% silicone is a breeze even with a tiny tip cut. The flow control is easy to adjust on the fly. The real test came with polyurethane caulk which requires Hulk hands to dispense from a hand powered caulk gun. It worked great with the polyurethane caulk.It has a ""reversing"" mechanism that requires some getting used to because if your hand slips off the trigger, it pulls the plunger back immediately and when you restart, it can leave a big caulk blob when it starts again. The ""con"" for this unit is the weight - if you have to hold it overhead, it gets heavy fast. I'm no lightweight - 225 pound weigh lifter and hockey player and it's a lot of work using this for 15 minutes overhead. I also wish it came with 2 batteries not one because it's pretty pricey. Overall, if you have a LOT of caulking to do with heavy bodied caulks, this is a decent investment but it's not perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RR26GYLEZD2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYUMO5A#wasThisHelpful","R2RR26GYLEZD2Q","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for a Keurig K-155 machine which the description includes as a machine in which these filters allegedly work. I tried two different filters using multiple grinds of coffee from medium drip to very coarse drip using a Capresso grinder with fresh coffee beans. I used 3 different cup sizes, 4,6 and 8 ounces and both filters leaked like mad, pouring hot water out the sides and leaking into the cup. Regardless of cup size, the coffee tasted lousy - really weak, regardless of grind or how high or low I filled the filter with coffee. A total let down. They might work fine in other Keurig machines but in a K-155, they stink.I tried a 3rd filter and finally, with a very coarse grind, it sort of worked. It finally didn't leak hot water all over like the first two filters and it required a very coarse grind to flow properly. I'm not sure how the coffee really tasted because I had hit ""taste fatigue"" after grinding a 1/4 pound of coffee and making about 20 cups of coffee. I poured 19 cups down the drain after a few sips but I think the 20th cup was OK. So if you are going to buy these for a K-155, buy the 6 pack because 2/3 of them won't work. I may return all of them tomorrow after I clear my palate and try the one filter that actually worked. I'll also try the other three filters I have not used yet. Quality control with these filters is obviously not high.All I want is a simple one cup coffee maker that doesn't require proprietary company pods that cannot be recycled and are an impending ecological disaster.  If anyone has a reusable filter pod that works with a Keurig K-155 machine, guidance on a great one cup coffee maker (The Bunn MCU?) or a recyclable/degradable Keurig style pod that isn't absurdly expensive, please let me know.

"Heavy duty 6"" adjustable drain cover with 100% stainless steel mounting hardware. This is a well made drain cover that has small ""feet"" that hold it off the ground about 1/8"" so the cover will not interfere with even a small amount of water reaching the drain. It's probably 16 gauge stainless steel. The mounting system is 4 metal clips that are held to the grate via stainless screws and nuts and are adjustable in the long slots seen the picture. I could see where this mounting system might be problematic if your drain is cup shaped or rounded. The mounting clips require about 2 inches of straight drain side walls to fit really well. I wound up reversing the clips to allow it to fit a 4"" drain in a tile floor but it worked out OK.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5V84HFOZQUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KPY58S#wasThisHelpful","RR5V84HFOZQUC","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was my original 1 star review (be sure to read the addendum I added at the bottom of this review!):The Amazon wiper size chart by make and model is wrong for this Trico exact fit blade. My wife has a 2014 WRX 5 door Limited (regular WRX, NOT and STI) and the ""find your wiper size"" chart is wrong. It says the WRX Limited car takes a 12"" rear blade and it really takes a 16"" blade. The sizing chart says the ONLY Subaru WRX's that takes a 16"" rear blade are the STI and the STI limited.So now I have a 12"" peewee wiper blade that will cost me more to send back than buying a new blade that is the right size. Very aggravating but the lesson learned is wait until the wife gets home from work with the car and measure the blades before ordering rather than trusting the vehicle fitment charts on Amazon. I'll go the local NAPA store instead and make sure I get the right blade that I can easily exchange if it's the wrong size or blade mount.ADDENDUM/UPDATE - OK, I wrote a 1 star review because the Amazon wiper blade fitment chart was wrong and I ordered the wrong blade because of that error in Amazon's fitment system. Then I changed it to 5 stars after Amazon did something very cool - read on to find out what they did.I went to the ""return item"" section on the Amazon return page and entered ""description on website was not accurate"" which sums up the problem. I wanted to register the fact that their system told me to order the wrong blade even if I had to eat the $12 I paid. When I got to end of the return process, Amazon said I did not have to return the blade. OK, so now I have to extract my size 11 foot from my mouth and say thanks to Amazon for being cool and not making me ship back the incorrect blade and pay the postage.I shot a photo of my laptop screen showing that the fitment chart tells me that the 12"" blade fits the 2014 WRX Limited and another photo of the 12"" blade on top of the original equipment 16"" blade so you can see that the ordering chart was wrong and that the 12"" peewee blade is indeed incorrect. But, as I explained, Amazon made all of this go away by simply giving me an instant credit and not making me pay the postage to return the incorrect blade. Got to get to work pulling that size 11 out of my mouth.....As for the blade itself - it is exactly the same as the one on the 2014 WRX limited 5 door, it's just 4"" too short and the 16"" blade will be ideal when I order it. Just to be CERTAIN, I took the old blade off and mounted the 12"" blade to be sure it REALLY fit and it did. So I'll order the 16"" Trico exact fit 16B blade from Amazon and say thanks again for standing behind your customers and your products!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLKNRBAVYIES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052XNOIA#wasThisHelpful","RBLKNRBAVYIES","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a competitive swimmer since the 1970's - before they ""invented"" real swim goggles like these and I worn every brand you can name (Speedo, Tyr, Swim Fit and Nike) over the ensuing decades. These ""Friendly Swede"" goggles are absolutely the finest fitting, best performing and the first totally fog proof swim goggles I have ever used.A few notes on the ""Friendly Swede"" models - the black set have dark lenses if you are swimming outside and want some sunlight protection for your eyes, the black set works well. The other pair are totally clear. The side vision is good on both. The straps are comfortable and they fit me perfect right out of the box. Speaking of the box, each pair has it's own carrying hard shell carrying case which is great because my old goggles are scratched up from rattling around loose in my swim bag.The fit was important for me because I have a large, round face and a lot of goggles just don't fit me well. These were perfect. They don't leak, fog up or misbehave in any manner. Overall, a solid purchase at an excellent price and I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQR2GH2KO5DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIO824U#wasThisHelpful","R1JQR2GH2KO5DZ","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear a size 8 hat. It's tough to get a swim cap to fit without feeling like my eyeballs are going top pop out of their sockets. I looked at the various Amazon swim cap choices and I took a shot on the ""Friendly Swede"" brand.

I dunked the cap in the pool and it went on my 6.3mm hair with no problems. I don't know how these would work if you have long hair or dreadlocks but for my large cranium, they fit fine.I don't care if my hair or head get wet, it's not an issue for me so I can't comment on that if you are truly looking for a ""dry"" swim cap.

"The description is technically accurate - it says two grill plates and one griddle plate but what that means is that only one of the plates is smooth - the other two plates are grooved. The flat plate also only fits on the right side, it is not interchangeable with the left hand grill plate. It has a full length opening between the grill/griddle plates that is about 1/2"" wide and the drip tray is directly underneath that opening. The plates remove and replace with equal ease. It heats quickly and I bought this for doing panini, reubens, pancakes and eggs. If you want a large, unbroken smooth griddle surface, buy the All Clad 99014 20x13 griddle. I figured this unit had more utility than a dedicated panini press and I already own the 99014 so for me the double grill plates were welcomed.It is typical high end All-Clad quality, the non-stick surface is very well done and drip tray is full length between the plates. It's very easy to clean, heats up quickly and unless you are trying to blacken something, it gets really hot. It is very good with panini and grilled cheese sandwiches and especially with eggs. I have not tried bacon yet. The highest temperature setting is ""sear"" which is above the 450 degree setting. I'll update this review as I get more experience with the unit. The reason I gave it 4 stars is for the ambiguity in the description - it can easily lead someone to think it has two flat panel inserts and one grooved plate which is NOT accurate. I think the description should be better written so folks don't accidentally order this thinking it is like a traditional flat griddle. The 1/2 space between the plates is not clearly disclosed wither and you want to make large pancakes, it can't be done on this unit without spilling into the drip tray.Overall it's a high quality unit that I bought for almost half off at an external site so it was worth it for me. But be warned, this is not a full flat griddle and it has a 1/2 gap between the middle of the plates1/1/15 Update - Contrary to other opinions and reviews, this unit sears very well as long as you use a bit of olive oil, butter or other oils on whatever you are trying to sear, especially boneless chicken. Don't use spray oils like Pam - they will void the nonstick warranty. One ""warning"" based on actual experience. I grill a lot of Jamaican jerk chicken and used the griddle along with the very excellent and spicy Walkerswood Jerk marinade. I had the griddle on ""sear"" and the spices in the jerk marinade aerosolized and it was like opening a can of Mace in my kitchen. We literally had to eat dinner in another room while I used a fan to clear the air. If you plan to sear very spicy food, think twice or do it outside.I have quickly grown to favor this unit. It heats fast, is easy to clean and it cooks fast. It works well for pancakes, chicken, bacon and Panini. I plan to try steaks soon. The non-jerk chicken I cooked (marinated in a locally produced Italian salad dressing) was excellent - restaurant quality, better than my charcoal fired Grill Dome Kamado smoker. More to come as I gain experience and clear my lungs after the jerk chicken incident.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XY5LFOIJ2LY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZ9QPCW#wasThisHelpful","R2XY5LFOIJ2LY5","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you can get this screen protector in place with perfect alignment and no bubbles, it's 5 stars. I read and followed the kit directions to the letter. From what I read it looked pretty simple to install but it wasn't. I was really careful but I still can't get a few small bubbles out from under this protector. Make sure you have the glass cover PERFECTLY aligned with the screen because there is almost zero room for error.  You also need to be certain the Surface screen is ABSOLUTELY clean and I don't think the kit supplied moist towelette and the lint free cloth are good enough.Per the directions, DO NOT TOUCH THE ADHESIVE SIDE ON THE SCREEN PROTECTOR FOR ANY REASON because it will leave a mark that you cannot remove from the adhesive side. In an attempt to be super careful, I also wore a pair of new, dust free vinyl gloves. As I was trying to align the screen, it slipped a tiny bit and I accidentally touched the adhesive side - instant, indelible mark. I don't think gloves are totally necessary because if you touch the adhesive side with or without gloves, it still leaves a mark.I would also recommend that you have a can of computer dust-off handy and give the screen on the Surface a quick shot of that compressed air after using the moist towelette and the lint free cloth.  Work in an area with really good lighting, no dust and absolutely no air movement. Now that I have experience with one of these covers I could get the next one on perfectly and I think you can as well as long as you are prepared to be really patient and methodical prior to the installation. I would have rated this higher if the installation process didn't require such high precision and additional measures (the compressed can of air) not mentioned in the directions.Once in place, it's an awesome screen - very clear and super touch responsive and if you can get it in place without incident, it would be a 5 star product but I was aggravated enough with the incomplete installation instructions and the actual process to knock off two stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRKD5ZI97977/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGIA71E#wasThisHelpful","R2XRKD5ZI97977","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this case directly from Lifeproof in mid-November 2014 because Amazon did not stock it until after December 5, 2014 or so. I bought the belt clip about six months later when it became available. I decided to condense my prior evaluations into a simpler ""pro"" and ""con"" format with some comments and a summary.Pros:Thin, good screen clarity, mostly functional buttons (except the initial cases mute button - more on that shortly), waterproof, shock resistant, fingerprint reader cover that works better than one on the Otterbox Defender. ""Free"" shipping. I paid $79.99 for this case and now it's down to $60. When you see a price drop like this it means that demand is waning.Cons:High price even at $60. Biggest issue for me is the screw-in easy to lose/forget ""extension cable"" required for most headphones and ear buds. Lifeproof made this choice to retain a waterproof case seal. You can't plug most ear buds into this case without the extension cord except for a pair of Bose ear buds I have that just happen to fit without the Fre cable. The sound mute button was useless on my first case but after the button finally came off after messing with it constantly to get it to work, Lifeproof honored their 1 year warranty and sent me a new case. The mute button on the new case works fine.  If you bought the Apple branded converter for the iPhone 4s to the lightning power tip, it won't work with this case unless you remove the phone from the case (a total pain). The case has a tendency to separate when used with the Lifeproof belt clip and I noticed some damage to the case from the Lifeproof belt clip on the side of the Fre case after a few months of use.Wish list for Lifeproof:  I wish Lifeproof would make the headphone pigtail cable about 2-3 inches long and self-contained in either the belt clip or the case itself so it's always available. I wish the belt clip had a backer plate like the OtterBox belt clip. The three points of contact design with the open back of the current case leaves the back of the phone exposed and to prone to getting knocked out of the case. The phone mostly commonly pops off the belt holder when I'm getting out of the car and I've fished it out from between the seat and console at least 15 times.A little known fact is that the iPhone 6 Fre case WILL fit in the OtterBox Defender belt clip for the iPhone 6 - it doesn't feel 100% secure but I had been rolling with that setup for about 6 months with not a single drop as long as you insert the Fre case into the Defender belt clip with the volume buttons facing down towards the ground.Summary - Slim design and basically a decent case but it's over priced with a quirky mute button and annoying extension cable for headphones and a belt clip that does not hold the phone securely. If you require a waterproof phone case, this case is worth the premium but if you keep the phone in your pocket or carry it in a bag or purse, keep looking for a lower priced alternative or go back to Otterbox which is what I did this past week after I grew weary of the phone falling out of the open back belt Lifeproof belt clip. It's two stars because it's over priced, quirky, the belt clip design makes it prone to falling out and required headphone cable is annoying.PS - I greatly appreciate the ""manufacturers comment"" from 9 months ago telling me about the ""new color options"" and that they would provide updates on product improvements. A bright color would help me find the phone after it falls out of the belt clip. I have seen ONE improvement made by Lifeproof in their case - the mute button cover. Lifeproof FINALLY quit censoring reviews on their own website. I suspect that was due to the real world reviews from Amazon. Bottom line is that if a waterproof case is a must for you, this is a good case but for me, it has too many shortcomings and quirks that do not justify the price point.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FRSN2QPAC233/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCJ4A20#wasThisHelpful","R1FRSN2QPAC233","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasted $50 on a metal oil can for olive oil that I bought on Amazon and it dripped and eventually leaked around the seams. I needed some sort of oil dispenser because I cook every day and I picked up two of these for $10. I use one for extra virgin olive oil and the other for vegetable oil and in a word, they are excellent. I can see how much oil is in them, they do NOT drip, they dispense the oil evenly and they are easy to wipe clean. They are also very heavy glass - restaurant quality bottles - the kind you see in Greek restaurants on the tables. The pouring spout looks like a standard liquor spout but for $10 for two of them, it doesn't matter.

"I bought this to cover my commercial lawnmower (36"" Wright Stander) so I could leave it outside over the winter and put another car in the garage. I bought the small size - 8'x11'. I screwed around with it for an hour trying to find attachment points that would work so I could pull the tarp snug. I moved the clamps all over the tarp trying to get it to fit properly. I finally introduced rubber bungee cords which are pretty much required to a attach this tarp to an irregular shaped object and I snaked them underneath the mower to hook the clamps onto. Even with bungee cords, the tarp was still was loose in some areas and I had to fold over the tarp 12'-18"" from the edge and attach the clamp further up the tarp at the expense of wasting tarp coverage.The Covrall tarp might work better on something like a boat or a quad where it's easier to climb around under the item to get it covered but I still think you will need a variety of bungee cords. By the time I figured out it wouldn't work on my commercial mower, I had gotten it pretty dirty and returning it was not going to happen (I bought it right from Covrall based on an Amazon sponsored link to the company). Since covering my lawnmower was out, option B was to use the Covrall tarp over my existing Grill Dome (Kamado style) smoker table cover which is not really waterproof and with winter coming, I want to better protect the Grill Dome and table. I wound up using a woodworking nylon band clamp to cinch the Covrall tarp down around the smoker table and the funky attachment clamps are sitting unused in a tool box in my garage because I could not find a way to pull the tarp tight without having about ten different sizes of bungee cords. The tarp does not stretch as far as I hoped it would and I was concerned if I over stretched the tarp it might tear.If you are trying to cover an odd shaped object, I think you are better off with a good quality nylon tarp (NOT the ones for $8.99 at Harbor Freight) with grommet holes around the perimeter that you can attach much tighter with greater ease. You can get a darn good tarp for $40 (1/3 the cost of the Covrall small size) that will be a LOT easier to attach. The plastic hooks Covrall supplies seem to hold tight but the hooks are sort of clunky in terms of size. The actual tarp was thinner than I thought it would be. It will be interesting to see how it holds up to a Buffalo, NY winter on top of my Grill Dome - more to come on that next spring.The Covrall tarp is an expensive solution for select purposes. I think the price is way too high and the clamps require bungee cords to really be effective. I knocked off a star for the high price and another star for the aggravation of not being able to get it to fit tightly on my commercial mower, especially after seeing the photos of that precise application on their website. I just wonder how the heck they got it attached to that mower on their website and how many guys it took to attach the tarp and how long it really took. The testimonials are their website are lame - nameless blurbs probably written by their staff.  Overall I had hoped this tarp would be a really special product and I wound up being disappointed by a lot of marketing bluster, the extraordinarily high price and the limited utility.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7Y09CY1IECQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LNKO3A#wasThisHelpful","RE7Y09CY1IECQ","A364ORODKP4XFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A364ORODKP4XFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Other reviewers have said the magnetic closure is not secure, and I wonder if they fixed that in response, because mine is quite secure.  I can get it to come open if I flap it around, but otherwise, it's good.  I can carry it in my purse all day, or loose in my arm, and it stays closed.  Generally, I don't use cases alone, but in tandem with sleeves.  There is no case that will protect the lens of the rear camera, not and leave it accessible.  The top and bottom here are exposed, as are the speakers on the side.  Some of this is by necessity (for the speakers), some for simplicity of design (for accessing the ports and controls on top) and some for consistency of design (the bottom, which lacks any buttons or ports).  I've found this sufficient to carry in my purse without additional sleeves for now.  I don't see the cover coming loose and allowing anything to have access to the screen.

"It's extremely thin.  I may be a bit biased coming off the keyboard case to this, but it is about as thin a case as I've ever seen.  The inside padding clings to the device to protect it -- it's not at all prone to opening in my bag.  I favor a full sleeve around the case, but I'm paranoid mostly of it opening, something getting under the case and scratching the screen.  I don't think that will happen with this.If you close it, the device shuts off.  Open it and it turns on.  Very convenient.For videos, where you want a more acute angle between the surface and the screen you position the spine at the top and fold the three panels in to form a quadrilateral.  It'll just go into the correct orientation by itself.

"These are incredibly comfortable headphones.  The cushions on the ear are perfect and give you the ""listen to the ocean"" effect of hearing the blood in your ears if you have no sound coming in.  They are about right for noise cancelling.  You can hear traffic.  You can hear someone yelling.  You won't need to hear someone next to you blab on about some nonsense you really don't want to listen to while riding the train or bus.  They're lightweight, so you can wear them for long periods of time comfortably.I've used them for audiobooks, music, and movies, and they work perfectly for all of the above.  Fair warning, if the audio feed has a sudden moment of getting very loud, the headphones will project that.  They have tremendous range both in pitch and volume.  I review a lot of headsets, and I received a sample of this headset in exchange for a review, and these are the best I've seen in a very long time.  They compare favorably with headsets in the $100 range.They come in a very nice, hard carry case and the audio cable is detachable, which means replaceable, which is important as that is the component most likely to be damaged.  If you're spending this much on a headset, you want it to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WE0NB0SAICQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R2WE0NB0SAICQG","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept is not entirely new, and not entirely fictional.  Children of powerful families are held hostage against their parents' good behavior.  That makes this a book that must be discussed on two grounds.First is its own as a book.  For that it is quite good.  It's thrilling.  The characters are fun.  The twists, while obvious in hindsight, are surprising in the moment.  It's the kind of book you can take on a long road trip and it will not fail to entertain.  I stayed up way too late finishing it, and I'm an adult who should know better.  It's that good.Second is how a book like this may impact a child as a student and reader, and that is where this book truly excels.  There is more than enough here that overtly parallels history that, when the child encounters that history in school, and it's hard not to, they will see the connection that binds literature to history.  That's one of the kinds of magic that can make a child a lifelong longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J89ZVS2BMFX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481442716#wasThisHelpful","R3J89ZVS2BMFX0","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a classic coming of age story told pretty much on point to the archtype (not so much formula as hitting all the points that a good coming of age story should hit).  I found some of the ""find yourself"" messages to be more than a little heavy handed, but that is common enough in kid's literature, and perhaps necessary.  The characters were believable and easy to identify with, and I think kids will enjoy it and adults will enjoy it enough to make it worthy of family reading time.  Not many books can do that.  It's also a good book to read with kids and explore the theme of self-realization both in the story and in the children's own lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8BBQQVOP406/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385391129#wasThisHelpful","R3H8BBQQVOP406","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is so much nicer than the cane sword.  It fits on the left hand and the blade ejects with a snick kind of sound, and quite a bit of force.  It's spring loaded, and if you look very closely you can see the spring, but I could imagine the ""original"" was the same.  It's heavy leather and has gorgeous detailing.  This one is worthy of Comicon or serious cos play.The ""metal"" looks aged aged, a little oxidized, and not at all like plastic. It barely feels like plastic when you run your fingers over it, only a bit too warm in the cold weather.  The leather looks distressed, and a bit worn, even on the inside by the knuckles.  The stitching in the leather is impeccable, and with a great eye for detail.  Some of the stitches are a tad longer than others, which happens with hand sewing, not typically with machine stitching.  Yes, it was clearly done by machine, but the effect is to look pre-industrial which fits the game perfectly.  There is even fake dirt in the spring of the grapple line.The buckles on top are non-functional.  It stays on with velcro straps on the bottom.  It fits my small woman hands only barely and I imagine would be fine on a fairly tall man as well.As with the cane, this is not for kids.  The blade is on the sharp side, as is the assassin logo grapple point (I didn't notice in the game that the hook is the logo -- very cool detail).  It could do some damage, especially if pointed to the eyes, and the grapple hook is a bit delicate looking.  Nothing serious, but handle with some care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJD5O3OMQ67I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJE3S2G#wasThisHelpful","R2LJD5O3OMQ67I","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's an okay mix of sweet and salty, leaning more towards sweet. The pretzels are sparse. The toffee is plentiful. The pieces are substantially larger than I'd like and hard to break up if you just want a small sweet. It isn't well mixed so some pieces are just toffee. Most lack chocolate, which is odd for a Hershey product. There isn't as much popcorn as I'd expect either. Mostly, it's toffee.

"It's really soft, not at all scratchy, and very warm. You can wear it doubled, or as a hood and scarf.  Either way, it is extremely warm.  Alternatively, you can leave it as a single loop which is still warm, but less so.  Good if you (or your meteorologist) misjudged the temperature.  I wouldn't say it's ever going to be a fall weather scarf. It's too warm for that.  But it's perfect for anything from mild to severe winter days.It's a high loft fiber, more on the black than the red which leads to it being very squooshy, visually interesting (the contrasting texture of the two yarns gives it more character than is clear in the photograph) and good at trapping heat, so it will keep you warm.  The trick to a warm garment isn't that it is dense, but that it can hold in the air warmed by your body.  A high loft item like this will do an excellent job of that with limited excess weight to carry around and make you feel too bundled up and overburdened in the cold.I've been trying to dissect the pattern.  There is a seam in the inside, so it was done flat.  The seam looks like it was joined by chain stitch, which is unusual in a machined piece.  The inside looks like it alternates between one knit one purl one row in red and then two rows knit one red purl one with a thicker black yarn that leads to the image of red windows surrounding a black background.  But not quite that. There is something else going on with the black stitches and I'm not sure what.  On the front it looks like the same K1P1 rib in red, followed by a row of yarn over red, knit one black, then knit one red, knit one black. Except the yarn overs lead to long stitches, not holes so something else is going on.  I'm going to be fascinated by this all winter.  Your knitting friends will love this just to figure out the puzzle.I found one knot in the yarn, and the instructions say dry clean only.  Those are the only faults I could find with it.

"The planet had to be there, except it wasn't.Einstein's great brilliance often manifested in seeing reality as it was and in assuming that what the data told us was correct, even if the theory stated otherwise.  It is a rule that underlines how science works, and yet it is a rule too often ignored.  If the planet wasn't there, then Einstein looked for, and found, the error in the theory, or rather he created the entirely new model for which he is best known.This book is very much for a casual lay reader.  It's easy to follow.  It's friendly in tone.  It's about as light as would be appropriate for the subject matter.  Don't expect a lot of equations.  Don't expect a deep dive into relativity.

"I was able to pair this pen easily with the 2015 Kindle Fire HDX 10"" and the original iPad Air.  The Air was already paired with another Livescribe 3 and it took the second pairing without complaint.  Data transfer is quick and simple.  The app is much the same on both platforms, with the addition of a free helper app on the Kindle side (it just runs in the background; you won't need to worry about it once you've set everything up).  It can sync with a host of services, including OneNote and Evernote.The back pouch of the notebook has the normal Moleskine phamplet, along with a bookmark for all of the controls for a host of Livescribe pens (Echo, Pulse and Livescribe3) and a larger card with the same controls along with a tap keyboard for setting up wifi on the Echo.The included sleeve does not fit around the entire notebook, which is what I expected, but rather it fits just around the front cover.  There is a zippered pouch, a front sleeve pouch, and a back sleeve pouch that actually sits inside the notebook.  I have taken to keeping the generous supply of ink cartriges there, and by themselves in the little paper envolope they came in they are snug and safe and do not damage the notebook.The pen loop, and why you need a pen loop for a pen case bewilders me, but there is one there, sits towards the spine side of the book.  If you put the sleeve on the back, it sits towards the opening, but then it is uncomfortable to write in the book.  I may take it off as I get towards the end of the notebook.Digital technology is best for archival and retreival.  If you want to store information over time or need easy access, you go digital.  Paper and pen is faster for input.  If you want to jot something fast for single use, or for later transfer, you go for paper and pen.  This marries the two, and it can do OCR to read your handwriting and convert it into digital notes, with accompanying corrections.  My handwriting is notoriously bad. In my social group, I'm the poster child for illegible handwriting, beating out our group doctor (but to be fair, she has stereotype-breaking beautiful handwriting). This is running about a 99% accuracy for me out of the gate.  That's not only impressive, it's frightening.For those who love the feel of pen on paper, this is a smooth, luxurious pen, a good ink flow on par with a Mont Blanc ballpoint, and the sumptuous paper for which Moleskine is famous.Fair warning.  It comes with a one year subscription to Evernote premium.  Once you get started with that, you will not want to walk away.  It is entirely too useful a tool.The only tiny issue I have, and I certainly won't ding it a star for it, is where other notebooks have you tap the band on the outside to confirm the notebook is available, this has you tap the band to archive the book.  I'm suspecting that means archive the last book of this number of this type, which is very clever, but it's not what long time fans of Livescribe are used to.That requires some explaining.  You can use a page over again, adding more notes, annotating, whatever, and the pen will update as you go.  In order to do that, the pen needs to know which notebook you're in.  Each type of book is coded differently, so it knows a one subject spiral from a flip book.  Within the categories, there are numbers.  So a number 1 flip book is coded differently than a number 2 flip book.  You can only have one book matching both type and number in use at any one time.  When you're done with a book you archive it, and then you can reuse the type/number combination and the pen will see it as a new book.  You get a number one Moleskine book with this.  There is a number two Moleskine book available.  The only difference in them is how the pen sees and differentiates them.  So rather than test, this one just archives the prior (I assume) and lets you go from there.This is a must have item for students, busy professionals, or anyone who needs to write things down and get at that information again quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5HOQB8SZ8U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A9Z1JK#wasThisHelpful","R2B5HOQB8SZ8U0","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Collapsing a work as complex as The Secret Chord into a simple summary guide is no small accomplishment, but it is executed masterfully here.  We are given first a very straightforward recitation of what is far from a simple straightforward plot, and from there we get analysis of the characters, the themes, the world of the story and the world of the bible in that time.Characters are analyzed as who they start as, who they become, and what the journey means.

"The summary, much like the book it is based on, takes more liberal tone than would be expected from a generally conservative pundit like Bill O'Reilly. In tone the summary matches the source.  The later analysis skillfully brings in four other works, referenced in the back.  I like that it is that thorough in so short a piece.  The discussion on both the state of mental health care in the 80s, as influenced by, and then visited upon Reagan, was interesting.There are two points of concern here.  The first is that it obviously follows a formula designed for fiction.  It has a section on characters, character relationships, and themes.  Now, Reagan was something of a character, but he's usually not referred to as such in the description of a history textbook.The second is the writing style.  The author is prone to cliche.  In a very short section (locations 146 through 167) we have ""She (Nancy) controlled his every action"", ""Nancy was dogged and determined in her relationship with Reagan"" and ""He (Reagan) seemed to have no problem bending to her will"".  The book is somewhat repetitive.  ""Alzheimer's disease affects memory.  ....  Alzheimer's disease robs the patient of one of the things that makes a person human: their memory.""The book excels in that it compresses a substantial amount of information, and most of the tone of the original work, into a smaller package (and honestly, the synopsis is better than the full text in this case).  It ends with a brilliant analysis of O'Reilly's styleIf you want to know what Killing Reagan was about, this is a great overview. It was shockingly thorough for so short a work.

"This plays with much of the plot from Dragonball Super (which needs to come to the US already!).  Frieza is resurrected with the help of the newly upgraded dragon balls of earth (now Shenlong grants two wishes, the second one used is sort of a throwaway, so no reason to introduce it here).  He trains.  The Z-fighters train.  They come together in an exceedingly predictable fight and kick the snot out of each other.And it is so much fun.  Beerus is a trip the entire time.  Vegeta is at the top of his form, so much better than the last movie, Goku is that crazy combination of serious and funny that makes him so delightful and Krillian kicks it old school.

"This reads more like the history textbook of an alternate universe than a fantasy novel, and I really like that.  Micheal Livingston is an academic, with a background in history, the middle ages in particular, and it shows.  There is little here that does not convince, little that does not ring true.  The world, the time, is more the appeal than the story or characters, not that there is anything wrong with either, but the world-building is astounding.  Highly recommend for fans of Heinlein.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157C1JOM1ZS14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765380315#wasThisHelpful","R157C1JOM1ZS14","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lies somewhere between a college book report on Grey, and the Cliff Notes.  Like a good book report, it's short enough to read right before the dinner party with the friends that read these kinds of books (if you're the type that reads these kinds of books, you're not reading the summary anyway).  It's detailed enough that you will be able to talk about the book with those friends, but getting some wine in them is advised if you want to keep the charade up for too long.There are no quotes, nor selections from the book.  Like the Cliff Notes there is a character guide, is a cursory analysis of the book, dealing with the surface topics but not delving into any area, and a very interesting section of the general public reaction to the entire series.  I would have liked to have seen something on how Freud might have interpreted Christian's behavior, or how the book plays the mentor/student story archetype, but that's probably more analysis than a book like Grey deserves.It was at points quite insightful, and I highly recommend it to students who have read Grey and who want to better understand literary analysis.  This text is such a clean, simple example of how literary analysis is supposed to be done at a fundamental level it would be helpful for students struggling in lit class.The writing style is straightforward and simple, presenting the facts clearly and concisely with an understated voice.  It gets you the information you want quickly and gets out of there.  If you're reading a summary, that's exactly what you want.  It could not be better executed.

"It's a reasonably good representation of Cookie Monster, but how impressive is it to emulate a puppet?I dislike the hands in that they are flat with no filling. They look unnatural and wrong.  I absolutely hate the eyes.  They aren't googly, as would be suggested by the picture.  They are like two pool balls glued together and painted.  They're really hard, so if your child hits himself/herself with it, it will hurt.  This coming from someone who managed to bonk herself in the nose on pulling it from the box.  If your child is in the bites on everything stage, you don't want them biting on those eyes.  The stitching is good, but I found a few snarls in the thread.  Not very noticeable, but enough to show a lower grade of craftsmanship.For an adult as memorabilia or part of a casual collection, it's pretty good.  For a serious collector it has quality flaws that would suggest against it.

"This is very clever.  You push the top into the bottle a little then pump to create a suction beneath that pulls it down.  They stay in the bottle very well, but can be a bit fiddly to get out again.  Not a big deal, just fiddly.  They work even if the bottle tips to one side or the other, say if something else bangs into it in the fridge.Two concerns.  One, it's a bit more work than the simple push in stoppers, so you won't want to have it as a temporary closure while you are using the bottle. You know, pour a glass, put on the top, someone else wants more so you lift, pour, put the top back on kind of deal.  This is only good for when you're putting it away.  Second, all the instructions are in Portuguese.  Takes a bit to figure it out without being able to read the instructions.Overall it's quite useful.

"This is pretty much the sweet spot between a basic wheel that lacks force feedback and a top of the line wheel that costs more than a console.  It clamps to the table (and do clamp it, or it'll go bouncing around if you crash into something).It is fully wired.  You need to plug it in for power, and the cord is pretty short so you may want an extension cord, and you plug the wheel into the USB port on the PS3 or PS4, so you may need a USB extender if you're far from the TV.  I'm playing at about 80 inches from the TV with no issue, but that's close to the limit.The force feedback is adjustable, at least if you're playing Project Cars, and it's a good idea to flip through the options to find the one that's right for you.  It emulates a semi-automatic car with gear shifting paddles behind the wheel.  Project Cars at least responds to that.  Since I've never driven anything but an automatic, I'm basically flapping them around trying to get a sense of what they do.  The wheel is comfortable to hold and turns easily enough, but with a little more resistance than a real car.  The pedals are big, close enough to the size of the pedals in a real car as to make it hard to notice the difference.  If you are playing on a hardwood floor the pedals will slip around.  Get a welcome mat to put under them when they are in use and they will stay put, this assuming you are attaching the wheel to the table and not going all the way with a frame setup.  The pedals are responsive and adjustable.  In the default configuration the break offers more resistance than the gas.The PS3/PS4 switcher is fairly hidden in the front behind the wheel, as it should be given you will be using that switch least of all.  You have full controls for both, including a dpad, options, share, and the triggers (but not the bumpers L1 and R1 that I've seen) right on the wheel.  Project Cars (can you guess my favorite PS4 racing game?) recognized it with no configuration required.Overall this is a lot easier and a lot more fun than racing with the controller.  I'm having a blast.  Now if only I could stop crashing into the walls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Y1VQMDKF171/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014US02ZA#wasThisHelpful","R4Y1VQMDKF171","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also comes with a storage pouch that is sturdy and very useful.Press the button once for normal mode, and twice for a ""soft"" mode that slows the unit down and makes it less uncomfortable.  It becomes easier once you get used to it.  The main epilator is a double row of tweezers, making it more efficient than any other I've seen.

Just hold the play button for a few seconds and it will beep to say it's in pair mode.  The sound quality was excellent, and somewhat leveled for movies (the difference between loudest and softest is compressed, which is ideal for headphones but often not implemented).My only complaint is that it shows up as some product code in the listed bluetooth devices as opposed to ""baseball cap speaker"" or something equally unambiguous and obvious.

I have not used it for more than three hours at a stretch, but it handles that without an issue.I am amused that the earbuds are oriented properly if you wear the hat with the brim that's supposed to shade your eyes in front, such that it shades your eyes.  You can pull them to wear the hat backwards, but it's more awkward.  I kind of hope this encourages kids to experiment with front-brim orientation.

"The one thing that surprised me is that it is outlet only.  You can't run it off batteries.  That seems kind of last century, but then pencils are a bit last century.I tried it with a host of art pencils from 8B to 5H and it was able to handle them all.  The points came out clean and did not break in the process, which can be a problem with the very hard ones as they can run a bit brittle or the very soft ones as they are, well, very soft.  This was able to deal with all of them.The automatic shut off is a great feature.  No pulling the pencil out to check if its done, just press it down until the sharpener stops.

"Light, quick game.  You build bridges between islands in an attempt to control those islands.  The player with the most islands at the end wins.  You score at three checkpoints, and the tie breaking system is the hardest part of the entire thing.  It's fast to learn, and really there isn't much to it.  It's a laid back, casual kind of game.

"You can move your five explorers (you don't need to use them all) on any of five paths.  You can move one square forward on each color if you play a card of that color that is higher than the last card you played.  So if you play a two, you can play a three or a four etc, to move forward.  You can't play a lower card, but you can discard it, and your opponents can pick it up.  Along the way you get bonus points and artifacts to raise your score.  Three rounds makes a game.This game is supposed to take 30 minutes to an hour, but I have yet to find even a three player version go that fast.  There is too much strategy and planning involved.  You need to think about what cards you need now, what you need later, what your opponents might use if you discard a card, and how many ""for later"" cards you can retain.  You need to decide when to bite the bullet and take a big number jump (limiting your later moves) and when to hold off.It definitely plays better with more than two players.

"This game is possibly the hardest cooperative board game I've ever played and I love it.  You can pick up one of the earlier kits -- Rise of the Runelords was first -- or you can start right here.  The game is structured so that Wrath of the Righteous is an adventure path.  It contains seven adventures.  Each adventure contains multiple scenarios.  You can play a single scenario, a single adventure, or the entire path.  You won't finish in a day.  Figure you're going to have a regular group meet for many session to finish.  We can get through one scenario in a day, though I've heard of players who can finish a scenario in an hour.The box contains everything you need for adventures 0 and 1.  You will need to purchase the cards for adventures 2 - 6 separately.  There are other optional card sets to boost each character class, or to take the game from a four player max to a six player max if you like.  The rather huge box can hold them all.  You will probably need rubber bands to keep each character deck.This game is hard, and expect to fail a few scenarios or have at least one character dead as you come up to speed on how it all works.  But it is a lot of fun, and well worth it for serious fans of table top gaming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQZMNYRDJVQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","RZQZMNYRDJVQB","AGJRUK27RBVYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGJRUK27RBVYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's like Tetris or Tangrams as a board game.The game is played for nine rounds.  At the start of the round everyone gets a puzzle board.  One player rolls the dice and everyone uses a key at the side of the board to determine which pieces they can use.  They then must fit all the assigned pieces into the puzzle board as quickly as possible.  You get gems for finishing in time (there is a sand timer), gems for finishing first and gems for finishing second.  At the end, the player with the most valuable gems wins.  You can play solo if you like.  It's a game for 1-4 players.There is an app for iOS and Android (though I could not at the time of this writing find a Kindle Fire version) that teaches you how to play, but really, it's not complicated enough to need that.

"My cats love it, but each uses it for a different purpose.Hikari uses it as lounger. At 10, he's not an old cat, but older yes. He loves his toys, usually and while this claims to be enticing to older cats as a toy, he's not into it. As a lounger, he loves it. I put it in the living room, and if we're in that room he's lying on it, at least unless one of the girls chases him off.Shinta loves the scratching post. This thrills me because she's not good about scratching posts generally and I had all but given up trying to find one she'd use. It seems to hold up pretty well, and she's really digging into it, but if she manages to destroy it I plan to buy another. It was supposed to come with a bag of catnip, but there was no catnip in mine.Aiko likes the ball, somewhat, and again surprising since she's never been much for toys. The battery is included, just pull the protective tab. There is a tiny hole on one side in which the ball sometimes gets a little stuck, but getting it loose seems to amuse her, so I'll call that a feature.I've yet to see one cat use two of the features of this product, but each very much enjoys the one feature he or she uses. In the scratching pad and toy it has succeeded where other products have failed.

"Easy to clean. Huge crock pot. At least twice as large in volume as my old one. The hinge is nice when just stirring contents or checking on the progress or temperature. The lid flips up/down but can also be pulled straight off to open or remove it for cleaning. The ceramic pot is very large and heavy. I'd strongly advise washing it sitting on the base of the sink because it is large and awkward to hold without hitting anything. The cord is ludirously short. It's about 16"" or 18"". You therefore must have this immediately adjacent to an outlet. With the flip cover it cannot really fit under a cabinet, so be sure you have an open counter to place this one. Otherwise you will need to lift the cover off instead of flipping to open it.It cooks well on medium. I cooked grains readily with the medium temperature for about 4-5 hours. Came out very moist mixing only a couple of times. Held the moisture in well. Not quite as well as a steam/rice cooker, but really about 3/4 as good for an appliance that can do many other things. The warmer works fine, although I would have preferred a slightly lower temperature for grains (so they don't get dry), it is probably configured to have a higher temperature to keep meats in the safe range where bacteria do not grow.Overall an excellent appliance and I appreciate the simple black finish.

"I have a number of Epson printers including this ET-4550, an Artisan 830, XP-820, and an XP-830. Like all of the other Epson printers this one includes the same package of driver software with utilities for scanning, copying, printing, and faxing. The software is easy to install whether for USB or network connected. This is a great product principally because of both the value of the included ink, the long terms cost savings in ink, and just as important avoiding the wasted time of changing cartridges frequently - AVOIDED.I was disappointed using the arrow controls on the b&w screen when all of the other Epson printers I've used have larger full color touch screens. This sadly DOES NOT have that capability. That counts most when copying or printing photos directly from a USB or other memory stick device. The trays on this model are pulled out by hand (the XP820/830 come out and retract automatically). But other than the display, it is a fast and high quality printer. Never had any problems with any Epson printer jamming even with the very thinnest recycled paper! I obviously have NOT had to refill the ink wells on this model (it runs for an estimated 11,000 pages before that is necessary). So we will have to wait to see how easy or hard that is. I'm sure there are many users out there who may buy this and NEVER put ink in it for a 3-4 year life and use of the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10H00OAH9EX2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFSM#wasThisHelpful","R10H00OAH9EX2E","A261P36T13YP98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A261P36T13YP98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No problem connecting to Windows 7 and Windows 10 tablet and computer respectively. The USB adapter was quickly recognized and driver downloaded.Sound quality was good, but honestly not nearly as good (listening to high quality music) as two Sony headsets we have. Giving it -1/2 a star for this.In terms of comfort it is quite comfortable and seals out some, but not all external point. Giving it -1/2 star for this. Overall I think you can find more comfortable and better sound quality headsets, but the microphone is better than most and the microphone boom/arm is sturdy and has alert LEDs that are very helpful.Regrettably I purchase this for use with an XBOX 360 -- which it will NOT work with.

"I have an Epson Artisan 830 (a different printer), an XP-810, and an Epson ET-4550. This XP-830 is the same size as the XP-810 and has similar features, but is a newer printer. The best feature of this printer is Internet based printing. When configured for either Epson cloud printing or Google (cloud) printing, you can print to this printer from any computer, tablet, or cell phone while you are on the go. When you get home or back to the office -- your document will be there on the printer. It is extremely useful for printing something like recipes that you'd rather have on paper. I've used it to print in between errands, etc.The printer works well on WiFi. Whereas I had problems on the Artisan series with WiFi no such problem here. The print tray opens up when needed, so be sure not to store anything in front of the printer. The display is a larger color display and is an easy to use touch screen for photocopies and scanning. You can scan directly to your computer.This printer also has a nice feature for built in graph and lined paper. If you ever need graph or line paper for school work, you can just print out a few sheets as needed. This is very handy for my middle and high school kids.After many years as an HP fan I gave up because of HP's rising ink costs and horrible printer quality. I'm now fan of the Epson printers.

"This is a very solid, well made watch. It comes in a nice box and is very well packaged to protect the watch from damage. The face and band are completely covered in peel off plastic to protect it. The watch is turned off and cannot be turned on until you remove a plastic piece below the middle dial on the right side. After removing the plastic insert the watch immediately began running. The color is a dark charcoal (not quite black I think) -- it has just a hint of metallic in the color keep it from being jet-black. The other ring rotates for time zones.I found the watch to be a bit heavier than I expected from the look. The face piece is about the same as a modern large cellar linked watch like a Samsung, Motorola, or iWatch. The price is such that it is about in the same range as the Motorola 360.It's a nice watch, but I don't think it is as simple as I prefer and the metal band is not as comfortable as a well fitted leather band.

"A bit small, but large enough to work. In my case the next line doesn't go down all the way to my chest (guess it depends on the size of your neck). I'm surprised that this wasn't lightweight metal, it is just plastic. So I'm not sure how it will hold up to being dropped. The head cradle is super easy to adjust. I don't like to set mine, I like to loose it off and tighten it on and the knob is huge and easy to use on the back of the head. So it can hold tight when flipped up all the way. Field of view is both narrow and short (compared to other helmet/masks).The auto darkening works reasonably well in that it darkens the center (kind of an oval shape) of the screen. But it does not cover the entire field of view (not good there). My biggest complaint is that the helmet does not go far enough back and over the top of the head to make it ""dark"" inside the helmet. This is not a problem in a dimly lit shop, but depending on the position of lights in your shop (or barn) or if you are working outside, it is HORRIBLE because light from the outside is reflected LIKE A MIRROR on the inside of the LCD mask -- and I truthfully saw a complete reflection of the building behind me on the mask. It was in that circumstance horrible to use.You can turn it on while it is on your head, but it isn't possible to read the mode or setting really without removing it.

"Comes in a right sized plastic tube that can be used to store the cleaner. The handle is a screwdriver type handle, but the rod rotates freely. This does make it easier to place on the head.

So it could certainly be used with a longer one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXYBTCOKA3C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KFVAKW#wasThisHelpful","R1NXYBTCOKA3C8","A261P36T13YP98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A261P36T13YP98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a bit of a tight fit for the Surface Pro 3 with the keyboard on. It is difficult going in and difficult to get out compared to the similarly made sleeve I had been using from another manufacturer. I do like the little zip pocket to use with the surface pen and to stow a mouse when I do want to use it. Although the side pocket is large enough to fit the charger, it is a tight fit and I feel that it would risk cracking the screen if anything pushed against the case and power supply because this material is thin. Overall I think that the material is too thin to offer protection for anything like airline travel. As a case to slide into my bag, it is fine. The case is not, in my opinion, really designed to hold the charger. If you are just going out for 1-2 hours and won't need the charger or if perhaps you are commuting between two locations (work and home) where you have a charger at both locations, this could suffice. But without the ability to carry the charger it is of limited use/value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36J1Z3LQVOT9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWGZSWM#wasThisHelpful","R36J1Z3LQVOT9U","A261P36T13YP98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A261P36T13YP98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Outstanding fiction. It is a hard to describe mix of science fiction, action, drama, military fiction, and historical fiction. A better explanation might be that it is a mix of James Bond, Revolution, and Sliders. There are elements of time/space travel, the principal character, Caswell, is an assail, but it is loaded with Sci-Fi technology that is out of place in time (as in Sliders and Revolution). This surprising mix is always interesting and entertaining. Character development is great. The author uses the out of time/space context language of one character to show the meaning of some idiom to one or another character in a way that is both entertaining and which makes a statement about our own (English) language and culture. I've read a lot of science fiction and I have to say that I was at first turned off by the killing, but keep reading. This isn't blind violence. Beyond the fiction that is later developed Hough manages to sneak in Caswell's own moral reflection. And although the early assassinations in the book appear in our world to never have any upright moral standing, we come to see that Caswell may actually be on solid moral ground in his current mission (think James Bond mission).If you can watch a Bond movie or read a similar story you will have a reasonable sense of the violence you will expect to find here (perhaps a bit more graphic here at times). But that isn't the story. Once you get past that both in the chronology of the story as well as getting over the moral judgment of it, you are launched to another world where even your moral judgment of what he did in the first world is called into question.Great story, amazing writing.

"We have the PSAT and three different Kaplan SAT review books and have been pleased with the quality of the books, software, and online tutorial materials and practice tests. But, there is something wrong with the ACT online setup. Creating the account for online tutorials and practice tests has students (my daughter) confused because in order to create an account you have to complete some questions including selecting which college you current attend. Since the ACT is a college entrance exam, it is pretty obvious that should not be a required question and it confuses kids who are already apprehensive about taking multiple exams. It looks to me like Kaplan somehow confused the LSAT or GRE login setup with the ACT login setup. We did NOT have this problem when using the Kaplan online services for SAT prep, just here with ACT prep. Disappointing. Like the other books, this book Includes some advice, explanation of the test, and a full exam to practice with. Beyond that there is a DVD with software included and online access to tutorials and practice exams.

"This paper is noticeably thinner than regular paper. The case itself is definitely lighter and shorter than a standard case with the same number of sheets. In terms of printing it works fine both on an Epson inkjet printer and on a Xerox solid ink printer. I wouldn't recommend it for anything where you want to present papers to clients or customers or where you have to print photos. Anything with a lot of ink noticeably bleeds (inkjet). The paper is a bit more than tissue thin.I think it is a great way to reduce paper consumption when you are printing documents for brief review or perhaps directions or information on the go. In terms of quality there's certainly a hit to the quality, but this is to be expected with a lighter weight paper. if you have a two tray printer, this is great paper stock for standard office use while keeping a heaver paper in a second tray. I'm glad to see a real eco-friendly paper that is more than just words and the color green on the side of the box. Even the packaging is thinner (recyclable paper). I've seen Staples office paper that is wrapped in plastic so it cannot be recycled (horrible). The wrappers here are paper and can be recycled.I've revised my review down from 4 stars to 3 stars.

"These are smaller than they appear (about 2-3"" in diameter). The rods are bent into a U shape in the package and a bit a of a pain to get very straight. Easy to install though, just unwrap the plastic from around the cylinder pictured, push the rod into the hole in the center and push it down into the ground. I had no problem pushing into even slightly rock ground. I place mine on either side of a set of plants that the deer have been chomping on really close to my house. Within a week, the effects were already clear, the plants were finally getting a chance to grow without being constantly eaten!In addition I am concerned about the deer carrying ticks close to the house. Lyme disease is a serious problem where I live. I like having these as a simple no maintenance way to just keep the deer back from the house. The exclusion area must be pretty small, because I still see them just dozens of yards away.

"The pump is definitely easier than pouring especially when it is full. I personally prefer fresh 1/2 and 1/2 with my coffee, but I honestly cannot stand the powdered ""creamer"" at work, so I purchased this for use in the office. This allows me to have a better tasting cup of coffee without lugging 1/2 and 1/2 to work or worse yet, having it thrown out on Fridays when it is still fresh...So I think the solution is great for work. Because it DOES NOT have to be refrigerated after opening (it is good for 30 days at room temperature), that's an added bonus. Saves me the time of opening the refrigerator at work and removes the possibility of it getting thrown out with the Friday clean-up. At home or work, it also helps conserve energy by not opening and closing the refrigerator door.How they make it taste like real creamer, but have it be okay at room temperature for 30 days is a mystery of modern science that I may not want to know the answer too, but it does taste good and is convenient.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWLJC995D0RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8T3SF2#wasThisHelpful","R2CWLJC995D0RZ","A261P36T13YP98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A261P36T13YP98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The history of musicals covers a great deal of ground. Besides the sheer number of musicals in general, there are musicals created for the theater, musicals created for film, and musicals created for TV. Then there are musicals that have appeared in one, two or all three of those medias. ""Musicals: The Definitive Illustrated Story"" attempts to cover it all--and in its 357 pages (including index) it does an amazing job.This large, heavy and reasonable treatment of musicals offers some things and omits others. What you won't find in its pages is a great deal of new information. Much of what the book shares is readily available on the Internet (IMDB, Wikipedia, etc.) However, here is all of this information, capsulized to be sure, but all in one place. What you will find in these well illustrated pages is a treatment of just about every musical ever produced. Even lesser known musicals are given a paragraph or two at the end of the book. Plus ""Musicals: The Definitive Illustrated Story"" highlights the various composers and choreographers and even gives a nod to the audio experts who helped create the audience experience.""Musicals: The Definitive Illustrated Story"" is not a cover-to-cover read--although I suppose that one could dedicate several evenings to this task.

"The SteelSeries Siberia 200 Gaming Headset comes packaged as a microphone equipped headphone with padded, closed earpieces. The headphones have long cord but it is not coiled (some will like this, some won't.) There is a combination microphone on/off switch and headphone volume control built into the cord.There no instructions included. Although instructions generally aren't super-important for headphones, they would have been handy.An iPad, iPhone adapter mic jack adapter cable is included (it may also work for Android devices.) However, there is no 1/4"" phone adapter included. Since this kind of adapter does come with similarly priced headphones, I was disappointed that none was included in the box.The headphone and microphones plugs are color coded (green for headphones red for the microphone.) This is helpful because, although the molded jacks are marked, they are not easy to identity. The mic recesses into headphones when not in use--a very convenient feature.The Siberia 200's audio quality was gauged by listening to DSD (two-channel SACD) files and uncompressed AIFF files played through a high quality headphone DAC. I sampled rock, jazz and classical music files. I also compared the same tracks played through both the Siberia 200 headphones and a Sennheiser HD598 headphone. The HD598 is a very credible mid-level headphone and a good reference headphone.The sound of the Siberia 200 was listenable and largely clean--especially on vocals and acoustic guitars, although the headphones struggled to reproduce the bass in Michael Jackson's ""Triller"" and Dave Brubeck's ""Take Five."" The overall sound was not as up front or as sharp as my Sennheiser HD 598s, but the Siberia 200 are not nearly as costly at the HD 598s either. In comparison to the HD 598, the Siberia 200 headphone sounded pulled back and slightly muffled, but not objectionably so. (One thing that I always listen for in ""Take Five"" is the crack of Joe Morello's drums during his solo starting at 2:12 in the cut. The Siberia 200 headphone was not able to reproduce the sharp snap of his stick hitting the drums and the bass guitar sounded a bit fussy--almost like the strings were frayed.)Connected to my iPad Air the Siberia 200 headphones fared better. Listening to a combination of FLAC and MP3 files, I found the audio quality to be more than acceptable. In the final analysis--and to be completely fair--the Siberia 200 headsets are intended as more as gaming than audiophile headphones. Based on this, when I listened to them on their own terms, they held their own even as audio quality headphones.The audio quality of the headset's built-in microphone is decent. Siri had no trouble understanding anything I said through the headset. In fact, part of this review was dictated using headset mic and the interpretation of my words was nearly perfect. Recording the audio from the mic and listening back to it showed that a windscreen should have been included with the microphone. There was considerable popping of ""Ps"" resulting from the close proximity of the microphone to my mouth.As for long term wear, the headphones are good but not perfect. They were comfortable to wear even for several hours. However, I found the self-adjusting suspension headband to be more of an annoyance than the traditional padded headbands on other headphones. It kept slipping to the back of my head. The acoustic isolation was decent. I was listening to songs at a relatively high volume while sitting next to my wife on the couch. She was watching the TV at the time. I could only hear the TV between songs. She indicated that she could hear the music playing in my headphones, but ""only a little bit."" She did not object to my listening to music as she watched TV--as she has with several other headsets used with my iPad.In terms of durability, there are some questions. Despite the ""steel"" moniker, the headphones are made mostly from plastic with the head strap cushion held on by something that looks like a thin elastic strings. If either string snapped with wear over time leaving the cushion dangling, it wouldn't be surprising.Overall, these are really a decent pair of gaming headsets. They are reasonably comfortable to wear, they sound relatively good, and, if treated carefully, should last for sometime. You could do much worse than the SteelSeries Siberia 200 Gaming Headset.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHK3J5TZNW17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WKYI0U#wasThisHelpful","R1KHK3J5TZNW17","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am no stranger to Q-See products. For several years now I've been using one of their older video systems to help secure our home. It gets the job done dependably when it comes to live streaming the security video around our home. However, I have found the interface to be more than a little mystifying. I can't get much more done with it outside of the live streaming. I'm an electrical engineer and you'd think that I could figure the durn thing out more easily!The Q-See QTH916-9AH-1 16 CH 720p Analog HD DVR seemed to be a better deal. For one thing, with 16-channels it has many more channels than my older Q-See system. For another thing, it comes packaged with nine cameras--one being a 360 camera much as you see in shops. It all looked very good. However, there were some surprises and disappointments in store for me.First, a misnomer: Q-See describes the system as having an ""Analog HD DVR."" So, which is it? Is it analog or HD (digital) or is it somehow both? One hint is that Q-See describes the system as ""HD"" but the QTH16 DVR and all the 'HD"" cameras were clearly marked as being NTSC/PAL. These are not the same thing. NTSC is a the old US standard definition (SD) TV scheme and is definitely not HD. PAL is also SD but for Europe. True, the system does support the H.264 HD compression protocol, but that doesn't necessarily make it ""High Definiton"" (assuming that that is what Q-See means by ""HD."") It's all very confusing and perhaps more marketeering than engineering.Second, a concern. Something was rattling inside of the DVR--never a good sign. I heard the rattle as I removed the DVR from its plastic wrap. I removed the top case and found a lose extra screw inside the chassis. I removed it, but was puzzled because the DVR has a green QC passed sticker pasted on the case. Didn't they hear the rattling when they checked this system?Unlike my older system that uses Cat 5 (Ethernet) cable for connecting the video cameras, this system uses BNC cables with a micro plug power adapter. This is good because BNCs make great connections. That's why BNCs are what the pros use for their video systems. It's bad because the BNC cables are rather bulky and hard to run.  Plus this makes the unit incompatible with the older cameras. With the older system I was able to use a flat Cat 5 jumper to run the cable easily through my windows to the outside cameras. I don't believe that there is anything such as a ""flat BNC cable."" Getting the cables to outside mounted cameras will likely be an issue--plus the cable lengths, while generous are fixed. You can probably forget running a camera cable from one side of your home all the way to the other to reach far placed cameras. You also may need to loop the unused cable for cameras mounted closer to the DVR. For the best installation, you may need to hire a professional installer to handle the system--if so be sure to factor the labor into the cost.Registering they system was a pain. Q-See asks for some questionable personal information, plus they want you to upload a proof of purchase in order to register the unit. As a Vine reviewer, I don't have a proof of purchase. Their site offered allow me to bypass uploading the proof of purchase, but this doesn't work. Clicking the Bypass button just put me right back where I started. Eventually I gave up--too bad Q-See!You would think that turning off the DVR would be easy, but it wasn't. I attempted to do a safe shutdown prior to moving the DVR from my test bench to the network rack, but there is no power button on the DVR. The instructions said to ""Use power button on remote,"" but there is no power button on the remote. The app has no shutdown button that I could find, so I had to pull out the power plug--never a good thing on a hard drive system. A safe shutdown power button should be part of the DVR hardware.Macintosh remote access of the system via a LAN from a browser required the installation of a ""WebkitPlugin."" Raise your hand if you want to install something named like this on the same computer that you use to do your web banking! I'm not saying that this plugin is unsafe or is malicious in any way, but it made me far too uncomfortable to install it. PC LAN access (Windows) doesn't require the plug in as it is handled via software downloaded from the Q-See site. However, you need to know which system you have and, unfortunately, the appropriate software choice for remotely accessing the DVR isn't obvious. After a successful installation on my Windows 7 PC, I was never able to get the PC to find the system.I fared better with their iPad app. It had no problem finding the system on my LAN and connecting to it. I just needed to figure out which Q-See app to use--there are at least three of them. (I wound up installing Q-See QT View HD.) I found the iPad app interface greatly improved over the Mac, PC and older Q-See apps. Still, Q-See has more work to do if they want to offer a system that is truly user friendly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22MGWSJ5DOG7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014AITON6#wasThisHelpful","R22MGWSJ5DOG7S","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a pair of Boggs boots (I've reviewed them on Amazon.) I love the boots except for one thing--they offer virtually no arch support. I thought that adding the PROFOOT Dura-Sole Insoles would supplement these otherwise excellent boots with the arch support that they need. Sadly, there were problems.The instructions provided by Profoot are confusing. Where does the right arch support go. It appeared that they had reversed the left and right insoles until I realized that the insoles had to be flipped over. What appeared to the the top of the insole was really the bottom. True, I should have known. The insoles are even marked L and R (left and right.) Still the directions were less than clear in pointing this out.The fit in the boot was poor even after carefully trimming them. Profoot thinks that only the length has to be trimmed but the width may be too large or two small depending on the width of your foot and shoes. After several unsuccessful attempts to fit these to the Boggs boots, I eventually gave up. Trim carefully as I might, the PROFOOT Dura-Sole Insoles simply would not adapt to the boots.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8944VOOTF0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYE2O9S#wasThisHelpful","RM8944VOOTF0O","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never been a fan of Apple's soft keyboard. I hate it on the iPhone because it's so tiny and my big, clumsy fingers are too big to accurately type on it. It's better on the iPad (only because it's larger) but it's ridiculous placement of keys is a problem. (What ""genius"" at Apple thought it was a good idea to put the Backspace and Return keys next to each other!)As for the alternatives, Siri is not my friend. Like a little child, sometimes she totally misconstrues what I've said, sometimes she completely ignores me and occasionally she gets it right. This, no matter how much I use Siri or how much I practice. Bluetooth keyboards are a mixed bag for me. They are easier to use (for me) than the soft keyboard. However, keeping their batteries charged and making sure that they are associated with my iPad is often more work than help.Enter the Belkin Apple Wired Keyboard. It's better, but not perfect. It's wired with a Lightning connector (other connectors are available but only with different Belkin keyboard models) so this model is only compatible with more recent iDevices. However, there are not batteries to charge or replace and no Bluetooth pairing to worry about. Simply plug the cable in to the iPad and start typing. The keys are well placed and have a decent feel to them, so it's a nice keyboard to use with the iPad. Plus the battery drain from using the keyboard with the iPad should be nil.So what's not to like? Well, a couple of things. For one thing the Lightning cable is quite short limiting where you can place they keyboard with respect to the iPad. For another, Belkin followed Apple's lunacy by placing the Home Key next to and below the left shift key (the shift key that is most frequently used.) You think that you are pressing the shift key, but instead you are thrown out of the app that you are using and right to the iPad's home screen. Nasty! A far better place for the Home Key would have been above the main keys near where the playback controls are located. (Strangely, when I wanted to use the Home Key it stopped working. So did a number of non-typing keys such as the lock button--go figure!)Finally, you get no instructions with this keyboard. None. Zero. Zip! Okay, so a keyboard such as this should be mostly intuitive. Mostly, but not completely. A bit of instruction would have been appreciated.Still, all-in-all the Belkin Apple Keyboard satisfies more than it disappoints. (This review was written with it--but you already guessed that!) I have no doubt that I will keep it in close proximity to my iPad Air on a regular basis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IDLQ1JX63N47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3WQTVE#wasThisHelpful","R2IDLQ1JX63N47","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit it...Printers are not always my friends. I find them to be cumbersome and balky never doing exactly as I intend. It's almost like they have a mind of their own. ""Do as I say not as you think that I said!"" Make the printer to be wireless and that only adds to the headaches.Happily, the Canon MG7720 Wireless All-In-One Printer with Scanner and Copier has made life much easier for me. The printer is truly full-featured offering wired, wireless and USB connectivity. It can print, scan and copy. Plus the MG 7720 can be easily accessed by mobile devices and tablets (iPads, iPhones, Androids, etc.) For Apple users, the printer supports AirPrint and that makes mobile printing from Apple devices even easier. Plus, in addition to it's Wi-Fi capability it also supports good old Cat 5/6 wired Ethernet. That is an important plus for me as it allowed me to connect the printer directly to my central Ethernet switch making it available to all devices on my networks all of the time no matter which Wi-Fi LAN that they happened to be on at the time. (Yes, my home has more than one Wi-Fi network for security reasons.)The initial setup of any printer is alway the most complex part of using the printer. This is also true of the Canon MG7720. Reserve some time for the initial setup because the installation instructions, while not difficult, are time consuming. In fact, you will find two large pages (printed front and back) of getting started instructions. It's a lot to look over, but do study them carefully first.While I did study the setup instructions I still managed a misstep or two. For example, I neglected to remove all the protective material (plastic tape) from inside of the printer prior to powering it on. The display informed me of this error and even told me where to look to correct that oversight. Also there is a plastic part inside of the printer held in by tape. I removed it, but I have no idea what is was for or how to put it back in the printer. That's a bit disconcerting.After I had complied the initial set up process, the printer went though quite a lengthy initialization process. Next I was guided by the printer itself in configuring it. It instructing me how to install the ink cartridges and the paper. The color touch screen guides you through ink installation process--quite a nice touch.Next the printer went through a long print test. A printed sheet emerged, but I was not told how to gauge whether the print test was successful or not. The next step was to select the connectivity to the printer (Wired, Wireless, USB, etc.) I selected wired and the printer went through its own magic process to connect to my router. It took a few moments but was successful and transparent to me. Finally the printer informed me that a firmware update was ""ready on the server"" (what server, where?) It suggested that I install it but was not clear as to where the firmware update selection was located.I eventually figured out where to download and install the update. Now I was ready to give the printer a try. The documentation instructed me to download the Selphy/Print App to my iPad from the Apple App Store. I did as I was asked and installed the app. I'm not sure that this really was necessary (except perhaps to print photos) because my iPad could print perfectly to the Canon MG7720 simply by using Airprint directly. No app required. As for my Mac, there was no need to download anything. I simply added a new printer in the Print and Scan dialog in System Preference. The Mac immediately found the Canon MG7720 and installed the proper drivers. No fuss, no muss.As for the printer itself, it features a very fast print time even for graphics. The quality is excellent as well. My complaints really are few. The setup process needs to be clearer and a bit more transparent. And, of course, like most every ink jet printer in this class, the print tray is much too small only holding a small amount of paper. Canon (and you other printer guys) it's well past time to fix this. We need a real paper tray that easily holds 250 sheets or more.Those gripes aside, the Canon MG7720 is really a nice printer offering many more features and capabilities than I will ever use. But its very nice to know that they are there just in case I do need them sometime in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWJKEB11PUCO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZY3C#wasThisHelpful","RWJKEB11PUCO2","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can be said in a review of toilet tissue? Quite a bit as it turns out...There are many things that can be bought strictly based on price in bulk. Toilet paper, however, isn't one of them. Recently I purchased toilet tissue in bulk based solely on price. It was a mistake. Now I know where low-priced hotels get their sandpaper-like toilet tissue! The bulk toilet tissue is awful to use--and there is still an awful amount of it to be used.Georgia-Pacific 1632014 Bathroom Tissue is not in the least like that terrible bulk-priced toilet tissue. It's soft, cleans well and is gentle. After all, isn't that what we need in such a personal use item? Furthermore, there are other uses for toilet tissue that require softness and toughness together. For example, my optometrist recommends that I clean my glasses with toilet tissue.At this point, I have no idea what I will do with the 100 plus remaining roles of my sandpaper-like bulk toilet tissue. However, I have no doubt that the Georgia-Pacific 1632014 Bathroom Tissue will remain in our master bath, guest bath and powder room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOGCT8LZP6KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00706WGFY#wasThisHelpful","R1TOGCT8LZP6KG","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued by the concept behind the Mass Fidelity Relay Hi-Fi Bluetooth DAC. They promise to provide a way to feed ""high quality"" audio wirelessly using Bluetooth from our iDevice (iPad, iPhone, Android, etc.) to our stereo systems. In fact, the Relay will work with just about every Bluetooth device including PCs and Macs. However, I was most interested in playing high quality audio from my iPad Air.The Mass Fidelity Relay packaging is impressive. It reminds me of the packaging that Apple uses for its iPads and Mac Mini. The aluminum block look of the unit is impressive as well. My only objection was the LED indicator as it shines way too brightly in the on mode. All cables are included as is the power supply brick. Installation was a breeze. It took less than a minute to hook the relay up to my Yamaha amp and get the iPad to discover the Relay.My system consists of a restored and adjusted Yamaha CA-810 vintage stereo amplifier, Polk Audio Monitor 60 speaker and Klipsch SW-110 Reference Series Subwoofer. The system is not the highest of the high end to be sure, but it is still very respectable for audio quality. I connected the Relay to the AUX 2 input of the CA-810. (I should mention that AUX 1 is connected to my MusicStreamer II DAC. This how I normally listen to computer audio files. I also have a Denon SACD player connected to the CA-810.)Now, let's talk a moment about ""hi-fi,"" audio chains and file types since they are very much related to the Relay's audio quality. I know that this discussion will be a bit technical, but bear with me.The audio quality of a Bluetooth device depends on heavily on several important factors including the implementation of the A2DP (Bluetooth stereo audio) profile, the type of source files, the quality of the source material and how well the device itself is designed. In addition, there are limitations to using the Relay including the iDevice itself.The audio chain in the iPad is quite good considering everything else that that Apple has to stuff into the iPad. It is good but not great. I would label it as ""acceptable"" (perhaps amazingly so) but certainly not as approaching ""audiophile"" quality. (Whatever that is!) The iPad is further hampered by the audio files themselves. Most of the tracks on my iPad are MP3s. Although they are encoded at high bit rates (320 kb/s and above,) MP3 by its very nature is a lossy, compressed media. That in itself removes some of the ""fi"" from ""hi-fi."" To listen to these MP3 files would not be a fair test to the Relay. Therefore, I downloaded several high quality FLAC (lossless compression) files to my iPad and listened closely to them. (One of my FLAC files is a direct digital copy of the mix down master of a classical music piece.)What I heard exceeded every other Bluetooth audio device that I own including the TP-LINK Music Bluetooth Receiver that I had previously reviewed. In fact, it exceeded the other Bluetooth audio devices in quality by a large margin. That said, there were flaws. I heard a slight amount of high end EQ push and a touch of distortion. Don't get me wrong, although these both were evident and clearly there, they were not totally objectionable. Still, I wanted to find out of the Relay could do better.To do that I connected the Relay via Bluetooth to my Mac Mini. (The Mac Mini also serves as my audio recording mix down computer. (Interestingly the Mac considers the Relay to be a Bluetooth Headphone.) Using the Mac and the Audirvana 2 Plus player I listened to several FLAC, AIFF (uncompressed) and DSD (SACD format) music files. I selected rock, jazz and classical songs and listened closely. Now I had the advantage of doing an A/B comparison of the same tracks played over both the Relay and the MusicStreamer II DAC. (Fairness statement: The MusicStreamer II is a different animal than the Relay. It is a USB connected asynchronous audio DAC able to decode PCM formats from 16-bit, 32kHz to 24-bit, 96kHz. The Relay decodes PCM 24-bit formats but not 32-bit without conversion. Mass Fidelity doesn't state at what bit rate however.)Technicals aside, the audio from the Relay was good, very good in fact, but not excellent. Using the Mac Mini the distortion was no longer noticeable (therefore pointing a finger at the iPad Air.) However, the high end EQ boost was still evident. Still, the audio quality was good ---clear, clean and enjoyable.Let me put this another way:* Casual background listening: Just about any Bluetooth device will do including the TP-Link Music Receiver and the Relay.* Casual listening: The Relay with the iPad will do fine.* Serious listening: The Relay holds its own and in an impressive manner.* Super serious (audiophile) listening: Here the Relay holds a second place to a direct USB connection via the MusicStreamer II. The exceptional clarity, flat response and super low distortion of the MusicStreamer II exceeds that of the Relay.To sum up then, I am very pleased with the Mass Fidelity Relay Hi-Fi Bluetooth DAC. It has much going for it including a super simple setup, right out of the box operation, classy look and decent audio that is just short of the audiophile level. For really serious listening, I still will be using my SACD player or my MusicStreamer II DAC. However, for just about everything else the Relay will clearly get the job done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNF3HLEWWU5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENN57G2#wasThisHelpful","R3RNF3HLEWWU5B","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Depraved Heart: A Scarpetta Novel"" by Patricia Cornwell is the long awaited, highly anticipated follow up book in the Scarpetta series. The plot, the writing and the characters successfully met my expectations. As someone who has read just about every Patricia Cornwell novel, I can say that this novel does not disappoint. If I have any reservation at all it would be that I'm not convinced that this is Cornwell's best work (hence the four star rating.)Her previous book left me wondering what happened to Scarpetta. The ""Depraved Heart"" answers that question and does so in an engaging and entertaining manner. Who really was the perpetrator? Can she really trust her memory? Can she trust her husband or niece? Why is the FBI investigating? These are the questions introduced and dealt with in this novel.I won't spoil the fun. You'll have to read ""Depraved Heart"" to find out the answer to these questions. I will say this, however--if you enjoy Patricia Cornwell's writing or even if you are just a mystery fan, you won't be disappointed or in the least bit bored by this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAIQCZKYYGPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006232540X#wasThisHelpful","RHAIQCZKYYGPT","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Brinks 673-80001 Home Security Commercial Marine Resettable Combination Lock appears to be a substantially made lock. However, no combination lock is useful unless you can operate it. And, try as I might, I could not figure this lock out.Instructions would have made all the difference, but they weren't included. True, the packaging promises that instructions are inside of the packaging. Some reviewers indicated that the instructions were hidden behind the lock in the packaging. There was nothing behind my lock other than the rest of the plastic packaging. I even tried a web search to see if the instructions were on line. Nothing was found other than others saying that they also could not find the instructions.*** Update ***Almost by accident I discovered the trick to opening this lock. Enter the combination (or use the default 0000) then squeeze the ridges on the blue sides of the lock. (Squeeze both sides simultaneously.) Then pull the hasp. Once the lock is open, you can reset the combination by flipping the little tab under the back flip up cover.Although I managed to figure this out, the operation of this lock is so counter-intuitive that it really requires Brinks to ensure that the instructions are included and also are on line. Because they did neither (as far as I can tell) at least with my lock, my rating will remain unchanged.*********Brinks is well known for their armored trucks and secure bank transfers.

After all, the TV show is generally well written and performed.Happily, I was wrong. (About the book, not about the Fox TV show!) ""Speaking in Bones"" is an engaging, exciting and overall great read. And as Lisa Scottoline said in her review of the book, the novel is ""full of riveting twists and turns.""

"Social Security can be a giant maze that you are asked to navigate. It really doesn't matter what part of the process you're in, the rules are just as complex and convoluted. It's all too easy to make a mistake that can cause you serious difficulties now and in the future.That's why a book such as ""Social Security For Dummies"" by Jonathan Peterson can be so valuable. These kind of books help demystify Social Security and provide the basis for understanding the things that you need to do under the program.For the most part, I found the information in the book to be helpful, and accurate. For example, the author states that the typical wait time in a Social Security office should be about 20 minutes. That's about right based on my experience. My last visit to the local Social Security office required a wait of approximately 35 minutes. The author does say that it's useful to call ahead first and make an appointment with Social Security. I didn't do that--I simply showed up and literally took a number. While I was waiting for my appointment, I noticed that somebody had done exactly as the author had recommended. They called for an appointment. However they were asked to wait longer than I waited for my appointment. Strange. There's no predicting the system.There are various methods for contacting Social Security and the author dutifully listed all the typical ways of doing that. These include visiting the local office, calling Social Security by phone, or connecting with Social Security online. However, the author failed to mention that you can often do a combination of the above. For example, I initially made my Social Security application online and subsequently had a question. Afterwards I visited the local office personally. That seemed to work out quite well as there had been some errors introduced by Social Security in my application.This leads to another omission in the book. One thing that needs to be checked  especially if you made your application online  is whether the application was assigned to the appropriate Social Security office. In my case, although I live in West Virginia, my case was assigned to the Florida office. There was no way I could see that error on from my online access, but the representative in the local Social Security office caught it right away. This suggests that even if you made application online or by phone, it's good idea to drop in to the local office and make sure that your application actually did get processed in a way that you expected.In several places in the book, the author makes good recommendations about when to start Social Security benefits after retirement. Peterson states, correctly so, that there can be value if your health permits to waiting until age 70 before you start receiving your benefits. However there is a question that I could not find answered on the Social Security website nor could I find it answered in the book. That question is simply this. Given the month that I turn 70 do I start Social Security that month or do I started it on the following month? In my application I had started my Social Security benefits on the same month that I turned 70.When I calledcSocial Security to verify this, the agent said that I had filed incorrectly. He suggested that since my birthday was in July, I should not have started Social Security until August. In visiting the office this was cleared up for me. I learned that since my birthday is in July I needed to start the Social Security benefits in July. However my checks do not start until the following month. This is confusing enough that it warrants coverage in the book. Hopefully a feature revision will include clarification on what is confusing even to the Social Security.It's been said, and there is some truth to this, that social Security is a tangled web of complex rules and regulations designed to make you fail. Perhaps, in part, that's true. ""Social Security For Dummies"" by Jonathan Peterson is a tool that you can use to avoid as many pitfalls as possible. As a result, this book will definitely stay on my reference shelf. I want it handy at any time that it's needed for any future issues that I may encounter within the Social Security system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDAOV5AKME1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118967569#wasThisHelpful","R1KDAOV5AKME1R","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have listened to Brian Wilson's  ""No Pier Pressure"" CD on a high quality stereo audio system. (""Pier"" spelled that way is not a typo--it's the name of the album.) The audio is lush with decent, pleasing sound--albeit with a pushed EQ especially on the high end. The bottom is solid and the mids are present as they should be. The vocals are clear and clean for the most part. Auto-tune, sadly is evident as is a heavy hand on the compressors. Considering the plethora of studios and the number of hands involved in the technicals (see below,) the sound is amazing consistent.The same consistency cannot be said for the tracks, however. Musically they are all over the place. Surf Rock to Disco to Jazz. Nice material on its own, but in context it's weird. Happily the ""guest performers"" fit into the album instead of the other way around as is the case with so many celebrity duo-recordings these days.Clearly, it's not ""Pet Sounds"" or ""Smile"" nor is it intended to be. The songs are catchy with some good hooks and clearly pop.

"America has a been an experience for me. I was working as an FM broadcast DJ when ""Horse With No Name"" came out. I quickly dubbed them the ""Best Neil Young Soundalike Group""--a moniker that I've come to deeply regret. The band was so much more than that. I realized that long before the group did an outdoor summer concert that our FM station sponsored. I was standing nearby with my wife backstage while the group enjoyed their dinner. Looking up Dewey Bunnell saw me and my wife and said, ""Please, sit down and join us."" Classy!Of all their albums, ""Homecoming"" has been my favorite. I own the LP and the CD, but I've never heard this album with the clarity and presence of the Audio Fidelity SACD release. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of a surround mix that puts me in the center of the band. After all, I normally don't hear bands in this listening position. Yet Elliot Scheiner's 5.1 mix, while placing the instruments around the listener, does not offend. He avoids the temptation of music musical chairs with the players--something that I wish that more multichannel mixes followed. Furthermore, the instruments are clear and clean as are the vocals. It's hard to believe that this SACD is mastered from 1972 analog master tapes.But above the fine audio quality, we have the musicality and creativity of Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnell and Gerry Beckley that shines in this album. Truly, ""Homecoming"" is America's best and, by far, Audio Fidelity's SACD is the best rendition of this magnificent album to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0GDYDUZBWX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZILB6K#wasThisHelpful","R1B0GDYDUZBWX7","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about convenience! Seville's Classics Foldable Storage Cube/Ottoman/Foot Stool is a perfect example. It's as comfortable as it is fashionable. Not only does it look great in our Great Room, it's functional allowing us to hide small items such as pillows and still have them handy.I have to admit that I was thrown for a loop when I first opened the shipping carton. I thought that Amazon had included only the top and forgotten to include the rest of the foot stool. Then I realized that the entire foot stool folds up in a neat, tidy package. Ingenious! Should I want to fold up and store the Seville's Classics Foldable Storage Cube/Ottoman/Foot Stool, it will take up practically no room.The foot stool appears durable and may hold up well over time. Any way you look at it, the Seville's Classics Foldable Storage Cube/Ottoman/Foot Stool is a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DF8WLM0OCVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROR7SYS#wasThisHelpful","R10DF8WLM0OCVL","A36IHC0K68NS2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36IHC0K68NS2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coconut water is supposed to be good for you. And if you like the taste (and I do) that's even better. However, the cost of even a small pack (16.9 oz, in this case) of Cocozia 100% Organic Coconut Water is enough to discourage me from future purchases. True, this sample was free thanks to the Vine Voices Program.

"Secrets of a Charmed Life was a good read. I didn't love the story like I thought I would, as it was a slower read and didn't completely hold my attention; but, it was still very good for the genre. My favorite part of the book was probably the modern story, but it only had a few chapters (most of the book was the historical side).I loved all the history that Susan Meissner had in this novel. It was great learning some new things! I really liked the characters (especially Charlotte) and how we got to see the way things ended via the modern story. I liked how there really wasn't much of a romance story and it was mostly just about the sisters and their journey. I also enjoyed how the story didn't reveal everything right away and kept readers guessing.The few things I personally didn't care for: #1, how little the modern story was a part of the book; #2, that pretty much the entire third part consisted of journal entries (which kind of made the story drag a little for me); and #3, some of the content -- nothing huge, but there were some curse words (H & D) and a short scene where characters had premarital sex (does not go into detail at all, which is why it didn't bother me quite so much).All in all, I really liked Secrets of a Charmed Life.

"Chance of Loving You is a collection of novellas, all stand-alone and by different authors. The first one, For Love of Money, was my least favorite because I found the story not that great and I didn't care for the characters. It was cute in the beginning, but the ending really spoiled the book for me...just didn't like it.The second novella, The Recipe, I loved! It was such a sweet story and didn't even feel like a novella. I loved how Aimee went on a ""journey"" to discover where she belonged and what her dream was. The ending was also very good!The last novella, Hook, Line, and Sinker, was a reread for me as I read it when it originally released. I really enjoyed it both times. The fishing contest was fun, as was the whole story. My only complaint is that the novella did feel a bit short, but still it was good.All in all, a nice novella collection. I enjoyed reading these quick stories and look forward to reading future novels by these authors.*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention/review it on my blog.

"What a great ending to Hannah's story! I went into this book thinking it was the end to the ""Yesterday"" series...little did I know, Amanda Tru would have a twist in the story and there's going to be another book!I loved how The Promise tied up the questions from earlier books and how not everything happened the way you would expect it to. The characters were enjoyable and I really liked the book. It was a great read, even for this reader who doesn't read that many time-travel novels. I plan on reading the next book in this series when it releases.*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention/review it on my blog.

"A Love Like Ours was another special read from Becky Wade. I loved the characters and finally reading Jake's story...which was such a sad, yet beautiful story.I loved seeing the growth of the characters -- not just Jake, but Lyndie too. I also loved all the scenes with Ty and Celia (MC from Meant To Be Mine). Another enjoyable thing about A Love Like Ours was the Thoroughbred aspect. It was interesting to get this glimpse into the training and racing aspects.All in all, a very enjoyable read. The scene at the end seemed to happen a little quickly, but the story was still very good and I can't wait to read the next Porter book. I recommend A Love Like Ours if you enjoy contemporary romance with inspirational elements.

"The Wishing Season is the third book in the Chapel Springs series -- a series I have been loving! I had high expectations for the story, since the last book (Dancing With Fireflies) was an all-time favorite read of mine...and, while it didn't eclipse that book, I did still love The Wishing Season!The story was so good! I loved how P.J. and Cole first met (let's just say it was a ""smashing"" scene) and the way they had to share the house on a trial basis for their business dreams. I also loved the characters and how jealous and protective Cole was towards P.J.All in all, a fantastic read! I can't wait to read Married 'Til Monday, the next Chapel Springs book.

"I've tried several recipes from this cookbook and can say that while I liked it, I didn't love it. The recipes have kind of been hit-or-miss, as some turned out great and were delicious (tastes-like-ice-cream kale smoothie) while others did not turn out at all (the fluffy gf pancakes).A lot of the recipes either call for ingredients that I typically don't have on hand, or they just seem really involved -- so even though they sound good, I haven't made them. There is still at least one recipe that I plan on trying when I have the time (orange dreamsicles!), but overall I probably won't use this cookbook much.*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention/review it on my blog.

"Playing By Heart was a unique story for me, as I don't think I've ever read a story quite like it. The main character, Lula, had to return to her hometown to help her sister and she ends up taking a teaching job as a music instructor and becomes the girls' basketball coach (even though she doesn't know anything about the sport!). It was really interesting to see how she tackled the new jobs.While the book did take me a little bit to get into (because I didn't know any of the characters or backstory, so when new characters were mentioned I was trying to figure out who everyone was), I ended up loving the story so much! The characters were great and I enjoyed the sweet romance story. There were some unexpected events towards the end of this book that made me care about the characters even more than I already did.All in all, Playing By Heart was a very good historical romance and I recommend it!

"A really good follow-up to The Priest's Graveyard. I thought The Sanctuary had suspense, action, and some thought-provoking moments. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending for reasons I'll refrain from saying to avoid spoilers.I ended up listening to this book on audio, instead of reading my print copy and, I have to say, the narrators did a fabulous job! They made listening to this book a real treat! :)If you've read The Priest's Graveyard, then I think you'll want to continue the story of Danny and Renee by reading The Sanctuary; but even if you haven't, I think you'll be able to follow along and enjoy this book.Overall, a really good thriller.

"A Broken Kind of Beautiful was so good! It's my first Katie Ganshert book, but since I had heard such wonderful things about her novels I was really excited to read it!

"Found is the final book in The Secrets of Crittenden County series and it ended well. It's been several years since I read the first two books, so that's probably why I didn't feel like I connected as much with this story. The mystery and final wrap-up for the murder was okay. Even though I didn't expect it to be who it was, which was nice, the final reveal was a little disappointing.I liked the romance and friendship relationships throughout the book. It was interesting to see what choices people made and if certain couples were going to stay together or break up.Overall, Found was a quick and easy read, so if you enjoy simple Amish stories, you'd probably like it. Amish fiction is one of my least favorite genres, but I've enjoyed this series and do recommend it -- even if this book wasn't as good as the first two (in my opinion).*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention/review it on my blog.

"Checkmate was so good! The entire story was filled with intense action/suspense -- from the beginning scene to that final, crazy ending.

Even though there were clues about what was going to happen next, I had the hardest time trying to figure out what it was -- and I loved that! There was enough info to where it was possible to guess correctly, but you'd have to be really, really good at picking up on clues. ;)I don't think it's possible for me to pick a favorite character from this book, because as the series has progressed, I've grown to love them all -- even Margaret.

"An August Bride was a cute little novella.

"Murder Simply Brewed is the first book I've read by Vannetta Chapman, so I wasn't sure what to expect.

"Other reviewers compared this book to Peter Kennedy's classic on the subject A Guide to Econometrics.  And, they found this book overly simplistic relative to Kennedy's.  After studying this book in some detail, I strongly rebut this opinion.  Pedace's book is plenty technical enough.  In some areas, I feel like he even matches if not exceed Kennedy's technical depth.  For some examples on the latter, refer to my comment in the comment section following this review.In my mind, the two books may have slightly different purposes.Kennedy's is more academic (in a good way) as it sites many relevant references and working papers.Meanwhile, Pedace's book is an excellent book if you want to derive a pretty good understanding on the subject so you are able to actually develop macroeconomic models yourself.  In Part I, he teaches you the necessary foundation you need in statistics, probabilities, and hypothesis testing to understand and develop macroeconomics models.  In Parts II-IV, he goes over in pretty great details over the multiple regression model that is the bread and butter of macroeconomics models.  And, in the last three parts he covers additional technical details related to data shape, variables structures, extension of the multiple regression models.  And, he does all that in a user-friendly way which is still at times very demanding given the nature of the subject.  Some comfort with math notations will be really helpful to digest this book.  This is inevitable given the nature of the subject.Pedace has an excellent pedagogical capability in teaching a complex subjects in a relatively simple and clear way.  To me, that's a huge plus.  To others, this is ""too simple.""If you read just a sample of Kennedy's book vs Pedace's you will notice a huge difference.  This is especially true when you factor that Kennedy imparts a large part of his knowledge through ""general notes"" and ""technical notes.""  And, those get indeed pretty technical.In the end, except for graduate students in economics, you will be very well served with Pedace's book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9CBMGUR4NQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118533844#wasThisHelpful","RQ9CBMGUR4NQ7","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extremely insightful book on the subject.  Paul Collier conveys this is a complex subject ill fitted to the simple binomial outcomes (yes it is good; no it is bad) adopted by the media, politicians, business lobbyists, and even economists.  The issue is not whether migration is good or bad but what is the optimal rate of migration for a specific country.  He makes a case that there is an optimal migration level or rate.  And, if we leave migration to itself, it will exceed the optimal level and eventually hurt.The social effects of migration follow an inverse-U shape, with gains from moderate migration and losses from high migration.  Moderate migration is liable to confer overall social benefits, whereas sustained rapid migration would risk substantial costs.  Also, a low-density country such as Canada and Australia can accommodate a far greater rate of migration than high-density countries such as Western European ones.Moderate migration has modestly positive economic effects on the indigenous population in the medium term.  Any long-term effects are negligible.  In contrast, sustained rapid migration lowers the living standard of the indigenous population, both through wage effect and due to the need to share scarce public capital.Collier builds an elegant model that explains the rate of migration from one country to another.  The rate of migration is determined by: 1) the width of the income gap (the wider it is the faster the migration rate from the low-income to high-income country); 2) the level of income in country of origin (the lower the income the higher the emigration rate); and 3) the size of the diaspora in the host country (the larger the diaspora the higher the immigration rate into the host country).The diaspora is one key variable in migration.  The larger it is, the more it drives migration into the host country.  Also, the greater the distance in income, culture, language between the two countries (of origin vs host) the more likely a diaspora will form and grow rapidly.  But, the more established and large is a diaspora the lower the rate of absorption of the migrants into the indigenous culture.  The migrants will behave not as migrants seeking to integrate themselves into a new culture but instead as settlers with no desire to integrate themselves.  Collier often makes this critical distinction between ""migrants"" and ""settlers.""  The migrants will speak their own language, and often not speak the language of the host.  They will often reject the culture and norms of the host and in some cases even attempt to reject the host laws (Muslims migrants in Europe seeking Sharia laws).  Diasporas mechanics cause them to literally grow forever.  That is unless specific policy measures to reduce migration and increase the absorption rate are taken.Collier refers to the intriguing work of Robert Putnam, a leading social scientist, that indicates that the greater the proportion of immigrants in a community the lower the level of trust between immigrants and the indigenous population, but also the lower the level of trust within the indigenous population (a surprising result).  High trust leads to high absorption rate.  Low trust leads to low absorption rate and rising diasporas.  The migrants turn into settlers.The US has been far more successful at integrating migrants to its own culture than Europe.  In Europe multiculturalism has risen whereby migrants are resistant to integration and insistent on maintaining their own culture thereby not adopting the local norms, not speaking the host country's language, not participating in the labor force, and even not accepting the country's laws.  He quotes, Angela Merkel as stating that multiculturalism has been an utter failure.  However, the cultural and linguistic gap between emigrants and host countries is far wider in Europe vs the US.  This is typified by migrants' Islamic fundamentalism that affects Western Europe much more than the US.  Multiculturalism combined with generous welfare systems (the European situation) lead to lower absorption rate based on the research from Ruud Koopmans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEE2ECTETXET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195398653#wasThisHelpful","R2UEE2ECTETXET","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part IV of this book on the history of different monetary systems is excellent.  The author covers proficiently Pre-, during, and Post-Bretton Woods eras.  She also does a fair job on the history of the EU and the Euro.  That's even though she greatly understates how much fiscal control the Euro Zone exerts on its members as demonstrated by the Austerity programs many of the peripheral countries are currently subject to.All other parts of the book are far weaker with numerous errors, contradictions, and obfuscations.Here are examples of obfuscations:1) Her presentation of the Real Effective Exchange Rate (RER) (pg. 24) is really confusing.  It seems that the spot rate for such RER between two currencies would always be 1 by definition.  I think the RER is only meaningful when looking at a currency vs a basket of currencies over time.  Only the related trend gives you meaningful information.  The author does share a graph to that effect on page 26.  But, the narrative is not well integrated with the upcoming graph.2) Chapter 4 focuses in good part on observing exchange rates vs interest rates over time for several currencies.  Thus, most of the relevant information is communicated by graphs.  Unfortunately, those graphs are so badly structured as to be undecipherable.  Instead, the author should have used scatter plots that would readily convey the information.3) Within chapter 5, covering the Demand-Supply model (to explain change in exchange rates) on page 81 the author provides a classic demand and supply graph that appears very informative.  But, it is not when you figure that the consumers and the suppliers are the exact same group of individuals (currency speculators).  Once you figure that, the graph is no more than a truism and does not explain anything.  This is not the fault of the author but the theory.4) Chapter 6, covering the Monetary model (to explain changes in exchange rates) is really challenging to understand.  I am not sure if it is because of the author or the theory itself.  But, there are a lot of strange concepts within this chapter.  First, the way money (quantity of real money) is defined it is more like a quantity of physical units rather than ""money"" as thought off any other way.  Related to that, at the bottom of page 96 the author makes a statement that essentially means that the quantity of real money never changes.  This does not make sense.  Economies do grow over time.  On pages 103 and 104, it seems some of the narratives contradict the graphs.  On the latter page, the author asks ""Why is the parity curve downward-sloping in the exchange rate-real return space?""  And, the answer is less than clear.  She next uses an example on that same page that contradicts the graph on page 103.  On pages 111, she refers to a couple of graphs but seems to get the y vs x axes wrong in her narrative; only to state this was not an error but an intentional rotation of the graph.  By then, I figured if I want to understand this model I better look for another reference.5) Given that the foundational chapter 6 was so confusing, it is challenging to make much sense of chapter 7 that stays on the same topic: the Monetary model to explain change in exchange rates.Error examples:1) On page 27, she explains on how to calculate a % change.  And, she makes a flagrant mistake.  You don't multiply by a 100.  Let's say a number of units has increased from 8 to 12.  She wrongly calculates it as: [(12 - 8)/8](100) = 50%.  But, the correct calculation omits the multiplication by a 100.  She makes this error tens of times throughout the book.2) On pages 172-173, let's say a currency is expected to appreciate by 5% over the next month as observed on the futures market.  She calculates that this is a 60% forward premium on this currency calculated as follows: 5% (360/30) = 60%.  This can't be right.  That's especially the case when she ties this beefed up extrapolated annual percentage with other annual percentages derived from her Interest Rate Parity and Purchase Parity models that have not been wrongly extrapolated the same way.3) On page 209, she refers to the Depression era starting in 1925.  She is four years too early.  In the mid twenties, the economy was still pretty robust until 1929-1930.Contradiction examples:1) On page 164, the author states: ""The Swiss franc is the go-to currency during global economic downturns"" only to state within the same paragraph that ""Therefore, there's no reason for the Swiss franc to be overvalued.""  Later, on page 229 she indicates that the Swiss National Bank was forced to intervene to reduce the appreciation of the Swiss franc that were killing Swiss exports.  You can see the contradictions here.2) On page 204 when covering the ""bimetallic era until 1870"" she indicates that ""whichever metal's price was rising, coins of this metal were disappearing from circulation.  For example, when the gold price rose relative to that of silver, gold coins were used to buy silver coins and gold coins went out of circulation.""  On the very next page she states: ""In the late 1840s, silver became overvalued relative to gold.  Hoarding of silver led to a reduction of gold in circulation.""  Both cases are associated with gold coins disappearing from circulation.  But, the first one is caused by the relative rise of the price of gold; the second one by the relative decline of the price of gold.3) On page 282, she states that the Demand-Supply model provides acceptable predictions about changes in exchange rates ""which empirical studies confirm.""  She contradicts this statement with her entire presentation on this model within chapter 5, where she indicates that such models have not been effectively predictive.  She also states somewhere else that macroeconomics models have failed in predicting exchange rates.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNBIWI7M0T09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111852389X#wasThisHelpful","R3SNBIWI7M0T09","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book because I am currently researching multiplicity or how to test multiple hypotheses.  This is one of the trickiest and most interesting areas of statistics.  I am an advanced Excel user and a reasonably proficient autodidact statistician.  Additionally, I have stuck with Excel 2003 as that is the Excel format I have used for decades and saw no value in relearning Excel from nearly scratch to adapt to the newer versions.In view of the above, I was delighted in finding this early version of this book (copyright 2005) that demonstrates all the hands on statistical examples in the Excel 2003 version (the version I use!).As a result, I have learned a ton about multiplicity and how to deal with it.  The Excel Add-in has terrible semantics regarding all the ANOVA techniques.  For instance to do a Two-Way Between Group ANOVA, you have to use in Excel the ANOVA: Two-Factor with Replication (which actually describes a different method).  And, Schmuller does an excellent job of guiding you through Excel's spurious ANOVA semantics.The book covers a surprising amount of statistics.  Once you complete reading, studying, and practicing the examples within this book, you will know a great deal about statistics.  The latter should provide an adequate foundation for any upper level degree in social sciences.Schmuller does an excellent job of outlining how much you can do in statistical analysis without earmarked very expensive software such as Matlab, SAS, SPSS or really cryptic ones such as R.  In the end, you will be surprised with Excel's capabilities.  Schmuller shows some pretty advanced quantitative methods including: the mentioned ANOVA techniques, probability, and statistical distributions sections.  He even shows you how to conduct Monte Carlo simulation with regular Excel!  That can save you a ton of money not having to buy another set of Monte Carlo simulation earmarked software such as Crystal Ball or @Risk which would set you back over $1,000.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFK2N3XIJDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764575945#wasThisHelpful","RSFK2N3XIJDW","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"E. Kirsten Peters wrote an informative book on this subject.  As a geologist, she uses a much more detached, scientific, and nuanced tone than the vast majority of climatologists who have taken a political fundamentalist position on one side of the debate.  Thus, contrary to what other reviewers have stated her not being a climatologist is not a liability.  It is an asset, rendering her scientific narrative more objective than otherwise.She explains at length the development of our scientific understanding of long term climate change.  She explains the very long term Milankovitch cycles that consist of the equivalent of four seasons that last over 100,000 years.  The longest one being the Winter which lasts for more than half of the entire cycle.  Meanwhile, the three other seasons are compressed within the remainder of such Milankovitch cycles.She outlines that other cycles of much shorter durations do contribute to dramatic variations around the main trend driven by the Milankovitch cycles.  Those include the 6,000 to 7,000 year Heinrich events associated with the periodic formation of large fleet of icebergs that cool the climate.  There are also the 1,500 year Dansgaard/Oeschger events that make the climate warmer than otherwise.  The somewhat irregular and staggered combination of the Heinrich events and Dansgaard/Oeschger events have contributed to the Medieval Warm Period from AD 950 to 1250 followed by the more recent Little Ice Age from 1250 to 1850 followed by a naturally occurring warming period to this day.  In just a few words, this explains a good deal of the naturally occurring change in our climate's temperature over the past millennium.Within chapter 11 `Global Warming Discovered' she does a good job of reporting the controversy regarding Michael Mann's Hockey Stick whose mathematical temperature reconstructions were rebutted by Steve McIntyre.  She does not take sides.  But, instead she lets Edward Wegman, a renown statistician, have the last word.  He will confirm that McIntyre was right.  This is actually a very interesting episode.  If you want to study it further, I recommend the excellent The Hockey Stick Illusion: Climategate and the Corruption of Science (Independent Minds).In her last chapter, she concludes that the climate change is far more variable, unpredictable, and controllable than what the IPCC reports suggest.Peters book is good.  But, my rating reflects that there is a far superior book on the exact same subject: John Kehr's The Inconvenient Skeptic: The Comprehensive Guide to the Earth's Climate.  Kehr conveys at least ten times more visual information than Peters through excellent graphs comparing our current Summer season of our Milankovich cycle vs the previous such Summer over 100,000 years ago, called the Holocene and Eemian periods respectively.  He has also several graphs analyzing the very limited impact CO2 has on temperature (because it absorbs only a very narrow range of sunlight's wavelength).  He has also numerous graphs on long term insolation trends and energy gaps that Peters hardly touches upon (she mentions related sunspot activity briefly).","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LR6KYDD52SWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616146729#wasThisHelpful","R2LR6KYDD52SWY","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original book is 500 pages long.  For a studious reader that represents close to 20 hours of reading.  In today's time constrained world that is a huge time opportunity cost to commit to the acquisition of knowledge on a single topic that may not be professionally that relevant to the reader.  Additionally, how much will a given reader remember of those 20 hours of reading just 6 months down the road? or how about 2 years later?  This seems like a huge investment of time with a disappearing return.  How about if a really intelligent reader could summarize the book for you and narrating it to you in less than an hour and you could recall this digestible knowledge any time you needed.  If you think that is a good deal that is exactly what this ""30 minute Expert Summary"" is.I confess I have not read the original book.  But, I have been very familiar with many of Kahneman's social experiments.  I have read and studied numerous works on behavioral economics.  Many of my colleagues had read the book and they gave me numerous excellent ""verbals"" about it.  Additionally, before reading this ""Expert Summary"" I read a Wikipedia article on the original book.  I also read several lengthy excellent Amazon reviews on the original book.  And, I also read a pretty outstanding (very lengthy 11,000 words) summary by a blogger who summarizes such books.  Given this foundational reading, I felt like I had a pretty good sense of the coverage of the original book.In view of the above, I feel like the ""Expert Summary"" did an excellent job of capturing the main themes of Kahneman's original book.  And, it was a competitive if not a better source of synthesized information than any of the other mentioned alternatives I had explored.  For one thing, it is a bit longer than it sounds.  It took me about 50 minutes to read (not the 30 minutes as the title of this series of mini-books entails).Other reviewers accused this mini-book of being superficial.  One reviewer in particular gave the book a very low rating because this mini-book did not mention the WYSIATI concept (which stands for What You See Is All There Is). Those criticisms are misplaced.  First, an essay of about 7,000 words (my guess at the length of this mini-book) can't compare with a tome of about 125,000 words (my guess at the length of the original).  That's just reality.  Additionally, this mini-book even though it did not mention the acronym WYSIATI, it actually covered extensively its many implications including overconfidence, misinterpreting small sample of observations, failing to apply statistics (Bayesian statistics) and jumping to false conclusion, substituting hard questions with easy ones, other errors in quick estimations, etc...I conclude this book summary delivered on its objective of providing you a good grasp of ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" in a minimum amount of time.  Given our time constrained world, and our hyperactive need to keep up with information, ideas, and new developments this ""Expert Summary"" series is onto something.  Unfortunately, so far they have published very few book summaries.  I hope they expand their releases of such summaries quickly as there is a dire need for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QC73T7FXCKIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623150604#wasThisHelpful","R3QC73T7FXCKIC","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For the ones who care to drill down further on any method you can always compensate the learning from the book with a Wikipedia article on the topic.Another reason why this book is interesting is as an introduction to SPSS.  SPSS is a competitor to R and SAS.  But, it pretty much takes deep computer programming skills to do anything with R.  Similarly, it requires extensive practice and ongoing training to use SAS.  Meanwhile, SPSS is so much more of a mouse-and-click ready to go program.  Thus, SPSS has rendered advanced statistical methods far more accessible than R and SAS did.  The authors do a good job of conveying the very user friendly interface of SPSS.  I recently read an excellent book on predictive analytics, Predictive Analytics: Microsoft Excel, that covered some similar techniques; but it demonstrated it in R.  And, you could readily tell how much more complicated R is vs SPSS.As mentioned, the authors do a first class job at covering a very extensive body of statistics within this manual.  However, I did uncover a couple of mistakes.  On page 140, fig. 9.1 the graph shows a symmetric Triangular distribution.  That's different from a Normal distribution (they meant to illustrate) as shown on page 151, fig 9-12.  On page 168, they calculate the Standard deviation between two groups as the average of the two within an Effect Size framework.  The correct formula for the ""pooled"" Standard deviation is the geometric mean of the two groups Standard deviations weighted by their respective sample size.  In most cases, the authors' formula, using an unweighted arithmetic mean, will get you a close enough estimation of the pooled Standard deviation.  Thus, those are overall trivial matters that do not detract from the overall quality of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQNO9ACW39YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119952875#wasThisHelpful","R3RQNO9ACW39YI","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book captures the business application of the foundational theories of Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow).  Other social scientists that wrote representative leading books to this one include Dan Ariely (Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions) and Richard Thaler and Cass Susstein (Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness).  This book is filled with numerous psychological experiments and insights sourced by the mentioned four authors.  Of the four authors, Kahneman is the main one.  Phil Barden's entire first chapter on Decision Science is focused on Kahneman's theory and framework.Kahneman's framework discloses that our brain has two different decision making modes.  The first one is the Autopilot (System 1) that is implicit.  It is automatic, effortless, associative, and subconscious.  It integrates perception and intuition.  It is made for fast, automatic, intuitive actions without thinking.  It can process a humongous amount of information quickly.  The second one is the Pilot (System 2) that is conscious, deliberate, reflecting, slow.  It can process much less information more slowly compared to the Autopilot.  The Pilot is engaged whenever we actually think.  The Autopilot and Pilot work together.  The Pilot and Autopilot have a different neurological basis.  The Pilot is headquartered in the cortex frontal lobe at the very front of the brain.  The Autopilot is diffused across a multitude of neurostructures within the brain (basal ganglia, amygdala among others) linked to all our senses and emotions.The Autopilot is crucially important from a marketing standpoint because it manages the majority of perceptions and expectations underlying purchase decisions.  Much of the book divulges specific strategies to engage the Autopilot of individuals to turn them into customers.Besides the first chapter describing Kahneman's theories, the last two chapters (5 and 6) are the most important.  Within those Barden educates on how to leverage Kahneman's theories within the business world.  Referring to the scientific literature, Barden indicates we have two basic motivational drives: Promotion and Prevention (similar to Fight or Flight).  Out of those two main drivers come out six implicit goals: 1) adventure, 2) autonomy, 3) discipline, 4) security, 5) enjoyment, and 6) excitement.  Barden captures those six implicit goals in a Decode Goal Map (DGM).  The latter is a strategic tool that Barden's employer, Decode Implicit Marketing (DIM), a consulting firm in the UK, developed recently.  The DGM is a tool that analyzes ad campaigns, TV ads, product packaging along the mentioned six implicit goals.  The DGM captures all those results in a visual hexagon graph reflecting the strength of the marketing signals along the six implicit goals.  A marketing campaign is bound to be successful if its DGM profile along the six implicit goals closely fits the profile of the product brand.Throughout the book I found it surprising how our vision does not work the way we think it does.  Our eyes are not a camera.  Instead, they interpret visual information in a subjective way that is often flawed.  In figures 6.18 and 6.19 two lines seem of different length; yet they are identical.  We seem almost blind when figures lack contrast.  Within figure 3.21, it is easy to see a ""Q"" among a bunch of ""E""s.  But, it is nearly impossible to detect the ""F"" that is too similar to an ""E"" for us to see.  Within figure 3.4, our peripheral vision appears arbitrarily discretionary (a dot on the right disappears at a certain distance only to reappear as you look closer).  Figure 3.3 shows two perpendicular lines of the exact same length.  Yet, the vertical one looks a lot longer than the horizontal one.  Figure 3.2 shows a thinner and taller bottle that looks like it has a far larger volume than a shorter wider one.  Meanwhile, the two bottles have the same volume.  In figure 1.7, you see two shades of grey that look very different because of the framing.  Figure 1.10, demonstrates visually how the two shades of grey are identical.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HVTRT6PG35DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118345606#wasThisHelpful","R2HVTRT6PG35DR","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you were to design a modern college level core curriculum of 5 classes in critical thinking Managerial Economics would have to be one of them.  And, Robert Graham's book is an excellent synthesis on this broad based multi domain subject.  This book costs only 1/5th of the cost of a related textbook.  But, it covers a great deal of this subject matter.Robert Graham does not shy away from some of the complexity inherent in the subject.  He imparts to the reader the necessary foundation in calculus to move forward.  This includes his coverage of the Lagrangian function that entails taking the partial derivative of three different equations and solving them in order to optimize a solution with two constraints.Graham does an excellent job in covering numerous topics including anticipating risk and uncertainty (and clearly differentiating between the two), game theory, many different aspects of decision making.  His ""Part of Tens"" is stuffed with very useful concepts including the price elasticity of Demand, mutual interdependence, and utility maximization.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8QG3QPGHG6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118412044#wasThisHelpful","R1I8QG3QPGHG6I","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall Conrad Carlberg has done an excellent job of covering 9 different quantitative methods related to time series analysis and regression.  Carlberg covers methods that are relatively simple such as moving averages and exponential smoothing.  He also covers others that are very advanced that few use outside of statisticians such as Principal Component Analysis and Varimax Factor Rotation.  But, in all cases he walks the reader slowly and diligently so you get to understand pretty well what those methods are about.This is a book not only to read, but study (I took 25 pages of notes while reading it over nearly a couple of months), and practice with Excel open and follow his own illustrated examples.The book also provides some interesting add-ins and support materials available at QUE publishing as indicated within the book. To activate those add-ins, you have to follow the instructions very carefully within the first page of the relevant workbook.  I think many reviewers, including myself at first, did not understand how to access the add-ins and thought they did not work or were absent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33IRRIR8LVAC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789749416#wasThisHelpful","R33IRRIR8LVAC1","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blyth shows how the piling on debt in the US was not due to wasteful profligate policy, but instead associated with the bailing out of the private sector, and the banking and financial system.  For another excellent coverage of this period see Mark Zandi's Paying the Price: Ending the Great Recession and Beginning a New American Century.Mortgage borrowers were defaulting en masse, housing prices were dropping like a rock, and the banks and overall financial system were either heading towards insolvency or in a freeze.  Without extension of credit and the associated brutal deleveraging of all sectors at once, an economy not only contracts... it just about dies.  If the economy is left to its own devices resulting GDP contraction is very severe and unemployment rate can reach 20%+.  You are in a Depression.  The solution is for the Government to pick up the slack in Demand and counterbalance the deleveraging and contraction occurring in all other sectors with expansive policies.  That's an effective Keynesian response.  Blyth advanced that's what the US did and it worked.  The US is now undergoing a slow and sustainable recovery and has seen its unemployment rate dropped markedly already (instead of heading towards 20%+).As the financial crisis contaminated Europe through the conduits of complex misrated housing related securities such as MBS and CDOs Europe faced a banking and sovereign debt crisis of its weak peripheral members of the Euro Zone.  After, a short and incomplete Keynesian response, the Euro Zone lead by Germany went on a destructive austerity path.  European austerity has already thrown the peripheral countries into a long Depression.  Greece and Spain's economies have cratered for several years plagued by record unemployment levels of over 25%.  Additionally, austerity has not contributed to any reduction in those countries Debt/GDP ratios as Blyth shows on the graph page 38.  This is because the denominator (GDP) has contracted faster than the numerator (Debt) has been reduced or written down.  This is the classic Debt Deflation conundrum that Irving Fisher had brilliantly exposed back in 1933 (The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions).  Also, austerity policies did not contribute to reducing the unsustainable yields on those countries sovereign debt (see graph pg. 65).  It is only once the European Central Bank bought such bonds to do ""whatever it takes"" to maintain the Euro that such yields have receded.Next, Blyth goes on a long history of austerity.  He presents a twin history.The first one is an intellectual history that has survived through the times.  At the onset, it was derived from interpretation and misinterpretation of the works of Locke, Smith, and Hume.  Later austerity was heavily promoted by the Austrian school of economics championed by Hayek.  Later, austerity found another champion in Milton Friedman and his monetarism.  And, currently it is championed by libertarians, the Tea Party, and the German intelligentsia.The second history of austerity is how it has worked out in practice from the 18th century to nowadays.  And, it invariably exacerbated economic downturns.  It is bar none the main cause of the Great Depression.  Back then, due to policy constraints imposed by the Gold Standard (not unlike the ones associated with the Euro today) Government felt obliged to impose contracting government policies to curb imports.  History demonstrated that the countries that left the Gold Standard first and were able to reverse their restrictive government policies were the ones who recovered first too.Next, Blyth covers what austerity advocates mention as the demonstrated successes of austerity policies including Denmark, Ireland, Australia, and Sweden resolving their crises in the 1980s and 1990s.  But, when Blyth examines the body of studies covering those events ""far from supporting the idea of `expansionary austerity' it rather completely undermines it."" In each case those economic crises were not resolved by austerity but by initial Keynesian expansive policies.  It is only once those economies were shored up that these countries implemented fiscal disciplines.  Once the private sector and households balance sheet are robust enough to take on the deleveraging of the government sector; then everything works out ok.Next, Blyth analyzes some of austerity's most recent ""successes"" including the recent economic experience of Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Lithuania.  However, when giving it a closer look he observes that austerity was not successful at all and confirmed one more time its really poor historical record as it contributed to brutal recessions in all those countries followed by subpar economic growth (see graph pg. 174 and table pg. 175).Blyth advances an interesting idea separate to his rebuttal of Austerity.  And, that is that a country to fully recover does not need to bail out its banking sector.  He mentions Iceland as a success story.  Iceland's three largest commercial banks had assets equal to 11 times its GDP.  Those banks were literally too big to bail.  So, the Icelandic government nationalized the smaller domestic portion of those banks' balance sheet and placed its much larger foreign portion in receivership.  This in essence placed the burden of their bank bail out on British and Dutch depositors who saw much of their savings wiped out.  Later, Germany contributed funds so those depositors recovered a few cents on the dollar on their Icelandic deposits.  At the time, the Icelandic stock market lost nearly 100% of its value.  And, five years later the market is still 94% below its pre-crisis level.There are a couple of problems with Blyth's letting the banks go strategy.  First, just like austerity it certainly can't work if everybody does it; or it can't work if a country of any scale does it.  Imagine if Italy or Spain let their banks go.  Or if the US had done the same...  Oh wait the US tried that on a tiny scale.  Remember the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008.  Well, that's when the entire global financial system froze overnight (spreads between LIBOR and Treasuries jumped from 15 basis points to over 400 basis points).  And, Lehman represented only a very small portion of the US overall banking assets.  Second, as reviewed above it is unclear how much of a success the Icelandic bank receivership strategy has been.  I think it was more like a desperate measure in desperate circumstances rather than a success.  By comparison, once the US Government learned its lesson that playing the ""moral hazard"" card does only exacerbate financial crisis (the Lehman bankruptcy) it quickly bailed out the banks by injecting $250 billion directly into the banks (TARP).  Within a year, the banks bounced back and repaid the entire TARP funds plus a profit in the tens of billions to the US Treasury and taxpayers.  Today, the US stock market has fully recovered and the US is not plagued by capital controls, IMF restrictions, and other limitations to fully accessing the capital markets.  A financial crisis most often needs a lender of last resort to be resolved (be it the Government or a Central Bank).  Absence of such a lender, you get continuing financial, stock market, and economic collapses.  For more on this fascinating topic I also recommend Charles Kindleberger's outstanding Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Wiley Investment Classics).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZEFXOGM141H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019982830X#wasThisHelpful","R3AZEFXOGM141H","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In terms of approach to investing, Phil DeMuth and Burton Malkiel (author of The Random Walk Guide To Investing) are very similar.  They both recommend you diversify your investments across several different asset classes by investing nearly strictly in index funds.  This is because they both understand and accept the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  They both recommend you stay away from Wall Street and their stockbrokers and financial advisors to keep your money in your pockets.  They both provide you many insights regarding the investment world.However, even though their message is similar Malkiel's book is far superior.  Malkiel truly delivers on his objective of explaining to you clearly how to invest and develop your own autonomous investment plan following his ten simple sequential rules.  Meanwhile, DeMuth is all over the place.  His narrative meanders often randomly from one chapter to the next.  Occasionally, he wastes an entire chapter saying nothing like in the first one where he explores what being affluent can mean depending on all sorts of different metrics.  The latter do not educate you one bit about how to invest your own money.Unlike Malkiel, DeMuth occasionally states things that make little sense.  On page 42, he suggests that an investor should be indifferent to time horizon. And, his investment allocation should be the same whether he needs the money in 1 year or 30.  That's absurd.  Short-term investments should be in cash like instruments to prevent market downturns causing you a liquidity crisis.  On page 47, he states that when saving for a future down payment on a house, you should invest in cash equivalents.  That's right.  But, it directly contradicts what he just stated on page 42.  On page 45, he borrows a lifecycle stock allocation concept from Kotlikoff whose financial planning advice is erratic at best.  I have reviewed several of his books.  This stock allocation suggests that once you are in retirement you should rapidly increase allocation to stocks to 100% of your investments.  Imagine your grandfather did that right now, would not you be somewhat concerned about both his prospective financial safety and your inheritance?  Given that this book is dedicated to the affluent investor, those points should be especially relevant. On page 56, he states that if you have $25 million dollars at age 65 and your lifestyle costs you only $100 a year, ""you will still be living with uncertainty.""  That directly contradicts what he states on page 50, where he indicated that if you have saved over 20 times your yearly earnings by your 50s you are pretty much set.  I could go on and on listing all the contradictions throughout the book.  On one page, he recommends you go at it alone through index funds (one of the main themes of the book).  But, later he'll recommend you pick your own stocks or even deal with a financial advisor.  In one section he is against you investing in TIPS.  But, in a later chapter he recommends them.  And, so on and so forth.Another area where DeMuth and Malkiel profoundly differ is in investment allocation.  DeMuth is very big on international stock diversification as he recommends in his streamlined optimal market portfolio that you allocate 50% of your stock allocation to the international sector.  Malkiel who first wrote his book 10 years ago was way ahead of the curve by recognizing that international diversification is not what it used to be.  In part because of increased globalization all markets are increasingly correlated.  And, that is especially true in a downturn when they typically get 100% correlated as everything goes south at the same time.If you are not expecting a crystal clear guide to investing, DeMuth's book is not all bad.  If you can overcome all the contradictions, this book is entertaining and interesting on several levels.  First and foremost, it is readily apparent that DeMuth is a very smart psychologist (he got a PhD in this field).  He is at his best when describing the behavior of the rich, and going more granular on the different types of rich folks like entertainment and sports stars, businessmen, scientists, and doctors.  He also gives you a very good tour of the investment field with all its various theories and models well placed in an informative historical context.  DeMuth writes like he would make a first class professor on the history of investment theory, or behavioral economics and finance.  Unfortunately, he is not so good as an investment guide in writing anyway.  And, that was the objective of this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPWM6N2UDQU91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076416564X#wasThisHelpful","RPWM6N2UDQU91","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Po Bronson refers to a huge reservoir of social sciences in analyzing how we compete.  And, he uncovers many counterintuitive findings.  Most everything we were told or we intuitively believe is wrong when it comes to competing.  I'll share just some of those insights below.  The book has obviously many more.Forget about the power of positive thinking.  When it comes to competing you need focus, intensity, and readiness to face expected obstacles and adversity.  A bit of insecurity and self-doubt motivates you to try harder.  Instead, positive thinking makes you mellow and take success for granted without being aware of the needed effort to actually succeed.  Many studies have confirmed that positive thinking is not associated with superior performance.  ""What matters is not Positive vs Negative Thinking, it's Additive vs Subtractive Thinking"" states Bronson on pg. 163.  Additive thinking is reviewing your performance and uncovering opportunities for improvement.  Subtractive thinking is regretting you did not do this or that without thinking of the necessary skill improvement needed to move forward.Teamwork is way overrated.  People underestimate how much time is wasted in teamwork.  62% of software projects are delivered late.  49% are over budget.  Productivity per person can drop 40% even within a small team.Forget about team spirit.  Some of the most productive teams had a hostile environment.  Think of Abraham Lincoln's ""Team of Rivals"" and the fractious geniuses of the Manhattan Project.  Some of the best orchestras are the ones associated with the most discord among musicians during practice.  They are perfectionists who push each other to superior collective performance.  ""A conflict free team means no one is bringing anything to the table that might engender controversy.""  From a performance standpoint, that's bad.The word ""teamwork"" alone is a major talent repellant.  In the workplace, if you want to recruit and attract top talent do not mention teamwork in your add.  Top talent wants to be challenged and have the opportunity to excel and demonstrate their superior contribution.  A workplace can be egalitarian and noncompetitive, but it will repel top talent who is looking for recognition and compensation for their superior performance.  The profile of elite scientists and geeks is not team oriented at all.  They are very competitive.  The top 6% of physicists produce over 50% of all published papers.  At TopCoder, the top 5% of prize earners received 80% of the total prize pool.  At Linux, the vast majority of implemented computer codes are generated by a very small elite of top notch computer programmers.Motivation at work is complex.  The more complicated the job, the worse people perform when being monitored.  Also, introverts work most productively without supervision that they find distracting.  They work better alone and in a competitive environment.  Meanwhile, extroverts are stimulated by interaction.  Without it, they get bored.  They work better in a team and in a cooperative environment.The winner is not the one who practiced the most (the ""10,000 hour"" bit as outlined in Malcolm Gladwell OUTLIERS).  It is the one who performs best under pressure.  When people say ""at the top level it is all mental"" they don't grasp that the mental mindset directly affects physiological responses and athletic performance. In other words, the mental drives the physical.Genetic make up plays a huge role on how we handle stress.  Our behavior is ruled by the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) enzymes.  The COMT enzymes reduce excess dopamine level, a neurotransmitter that fuels the brain reward center.  Some people have fast acting COMT enzymes that reduce excess dopamine quickly.  This allows them to handle stress well and even to need stress to perform at their best.  In regular conditions, they may be unmotivated.  Others have slow acting COMT enzymes that take longer to reduce excess dopamine.  They get overwhelmed and don't perform well under stress.  But, they may be more focused under normal conditions.  And, some people have a balance of the two speeds of COMT enzymes behaving somewhat in between the two described profiles.  Pro Bronson shares an excellent table on pg. 71 that outlines the behavioral differences between the fast COMT individuals (Warriors) and the slow COMT ones (Worriers).  The Warriors have sub-optimal dopamine levels under normal conditions (bored easily), but optimal ones during stress (perform well under stress).  They are good test takers and are good at rapid task switching.  Somehow, when malfunctioning they are prone to schizophrenia.  The Worriers are just the opposite.  They have optimal dopamine levels under normal conditions (focused in daily life).  But, they have too much dopamine when under stress (freak out).  They are not good at rapid task switching.  But, they have a better working memory.  When malfunctioning they are predictably prone to anxiety.Surprisingly, Worriers can handle stress when the later is somewhat predictable within a specific profession.  For instance, Worriers ultimately can make for the best pilots even in stressful situations.  With experience they learn to handle all the customary stressors of their profession.  And, with superior working memory, complex planning, and thinking capabilities they can over time excel and surpass Warriors capabilities.There is a strong genetic gender gap.  Regardless of COMT genotype, estrogen slows down dopamine reabsorption by 30%.  Women have a strong leaning towards slow COMT related psychological behavior.Women are much better at assessing their skill level and their probability of winning.  Men are often overconfident.  As a result, women compete much less readily.  Often, if they don't feel they have a fair chance of winning they won't feel like wasting their time.  Meanwhile, men will more readily compete without investing much time in assessing their probability of winning.  This is why there are so few women in Congress.  It is not discrimination.  After all there are more women voters than men.  Women are a lot less likely to throw their hat in the ring when probability of winning is low.  And, in politics on your first few campaigns, one's chance of winning is often low.Women manage or reduce risk more than men.  In gambling, women make smaller bets.Women are better stock analysts on Wall Street.  Women are under represented in this field clearly because of cultural discrimination.  Wall Street is one of the last bastion of cultural machismo still standing.Men are risk takers.  Thus, they account for the vast majority of venture capitalists, start ups, and high tech company founders.  For women, those fields do not provide attractive odds (they are right).  Women are focused on the probability of losses.  Men are focused on the gain potential.  Both psychological profiles play an important role within our business culture and economy.Women thrive in a competitive academic environment.  The strong academic performers will pull all the other girls up.  Boys react differently.  The strong performers will actually cause the performance of the weaker ones to deteriorate as the latter get discouraged and intimidated.  As a parent, consider placing your girl in the best possible school with the smartest peers possible.  Put your boy in a school with the best teachers, but not necessarily the most academically competitive peers.  To study the early academic challenges of boys, I also recommend the excellent Why Boys Fail: Saving Our Sons from an Educational System That's Leaving Them Behind.How one interprets stress in sports is key.  Stress can be interpreted as a threat and puts one in a prevention-oriented mode (risk averse, minimizing losses).  Stress can also be interpreted as a challenge associated with a gain-oriented mode (seeking opportunities, risk taking, maximizing gains).  Po Bronson refers to it as playing not to lose vs playing to win.  Those different mindsets have strong physiological implications.  In sports, the prevention-oriented mode through the noradrenaline vs adrenaline equilibrium causes your veins to constrict, reduces your aerobic capacity and lung functions, and affects your glucose production.  In other words, it impairs athletic performance.  Thus, playing not to lose is often counterproductive and actually causes one to actually lose.  When playing to win all the physiological effects are opposite and enhance athletic performance.Bronson's analysis of the Mauresno-Henin 2006 Wimbledon women's final was excellent.  He demonstrated that set by set the one who played conservatively lost to the one who went for her shots.  One should also factor that grass is the surface that does favor a playing to win strategy (on clay it may be the opposite).How one interprets stress at work is also key, but it is different.  In a gain-oriented mode, your amygdala is turned down, and your brain's reward center is turned up.  You are more creative, work well under pressure and tight deadlines.  But, you may make more mistakes as a result.  In a prevention-oriented mode, your physiological response is just the opposite.  However, this mindset has its benefits.  You are more focused on the details.  You are more diligent, make fewer mistakes.  You can anticipate obstacles.  Our information age requires from us that we have both psychological systems and thinking styles highly tuned up.  And, that we have the ability to shift mode as needed to optimize our work performance and the one of the firm.Are you a good sport?  How you handle wins (that's the easy part) is very predictive of how you handle losses (not so easy) and vice versa.  Bronson has an interest list of four archetypes of win/loss styles on page 237.  You will most probably identify with one of those.  Hopefully, it won't be too embarrassing.  But, if it is, it will eventually lead you to wisdom or at least humor.  On one of the last pages, Bronson has a great concluding statement: ""with experience, people learn that winning and losing are just short-term consequences to the long-term goal: improvement.""There are a lot of interesting ""effects.""  The ""network effect"" is the positive competitive and cooperative force triggered by talented people specializing in a discipline living and working proximate to each other.  Silicon Valley and Hollywood are such clusters of talent with strong network effect.  Richard Florida in Who's Your City? studied this concept in fruitful details.  The ""Matthew Effect"" is the dynamic whereby an early champion receives an increasing amount of resources, positive feedback, adulation so that he distances himself further from the remainder of the field.  The ""Mark Effect"" describes when organizations take steps to equalize the competitive field by redistributing the resources that would otherwise automatically gravitate towards the early winners.  This is most prevalent in k-12 grades.Out of 240 pages of studying the science of competition, Bronson offers one single page of self-help (pg. 239) on how to leverage the science to make you a better competitor.  And, that's the way it should be.  Bronson focused on the science, not on the pop psychology that plagues the self-help genre.  Once you study the science, the self-help part becomes self-evident, yet very challenging.  It relates to knowing thyself (what COMT type are you?).  How do you frame stress (challenge vs threat)?  What mindset, working environment, and sports are optimal for your own performance?  Within your psychological profile, what can you change? What should you accept and work with to improve your performance in life?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWLVO7ORXGJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455515159#wasThisHelpful","R3QWLVO7ORXGJU","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlie Leduff is a very talented journalist and writer.  Other reviewers have compared his raw writing style to Hunter Thompson and Jack Kerouac.  And, they are onto something.This book is at the same time very depressing and fascinating.  Detroit is an American urban tragedy that Charlie takes very personally as his own family is genuinely part of that tragedy too.In a firsthand narrative the findings of Charlie Leduff remind me somewhat of what Charles Murray's research put in a social science context in Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010.""Detroit"" is not for everybody.  But, Hunter Thompson's fans may really appreciate this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127Z2UUIRK8OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205345#wasThisHelpful","R127Z2UUIRK8OY","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corporate finance is a vast subject as it overlaps with many technical areas including accounting, micro and macroeconomics, capital markets, and investment management.  Your regular corporate finance textbook approaches 800 pages, weighs several pounds, and costs $150.  Michael Taillard made an effort to render this vast subject accessible in an easy to read For Dummies format for about a tenth of the price of a regular textbook.Overall, Taillard has succeeded in producing a body of knowledge on corporate finance accessible to the layperson.  Of course, he had to cut some corners relative to a full-fledged textbook.  For instance, chapter 13 on valuating derivatives is rudimentary.  It purposefully avoids dealing with the Black Scholes option model and any of its advanced successors.  This whole chapter entirely avoids the complex underlying mathematics with derivatives.  And, that's a good thing.  In other areas, Taillard covers well surprisingly theoretical concepts such as CAPM and APT.Taillard covers a lot of topics elegantly and teaches numerous types of interesting ratios and metrics.The small reservation I do have is I did find either errors or inconsistencies in some of his ratio presentations.  For instance, he defines Net profit margin as Net income x 100/Sales instead of the usual Net income/Sales (pg.83).  Yet on the next few pages, he will use the correct formulas for ROA, Operating income margin, and Gross profit margin (by avoiding the multiplying by a 100).  On page 94, he defines a strange ratio: Equity Multiplier as the ratio of a company's assets that stockholders own.  And, he calculates it as Assets/Equity.  Meanwhile, if he wanted to calculate what he meant it should be: Equity/Assets.  On page 96, he shows a definition of Financial Leverage that is plain wrong.  Financial Leverage is typically defined as a Debt/Equity ratio that is balance sheet driven.  His definition has nothing to do with this concept.  Also, on page 105 he defines a ratio that is not meaningful for measuring the financial condition of a bank: Deposits/Capital.  He views a bank's large deposit base as a risk because of potential runs on banks.  However, with FDIC insurance the runs on banks have moved away from their deposit base to their wholesale borrowings (commercial paper).  The recent financial crisis was associated with a liquidity crisis when the financial intermediaries could not roll over their commercial paper.  By contrast, deposits (mostly insured) are a far safer source of funding for banks.In summary, this is a good book on the subject despite the few errors I uncovered.  If anyone wants to drill down a bit more on any technical subject, it is really easy to jump off from the book into Wikipedia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5U9I1FIQ04K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118412796#wasThisHelpful","R2P5U9I1FIQ04K","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The authors do an outstanding job of explaining what big data is and what people do with it.  Because of technological improvement and declining costs in storage capacity, we can now analyze vastly more data than we used to.  Before, we handled big data sets by reducing it down to manageable much smaller random samples and analyzing the latter using traditional statistics methods (hypothesis testing, multivariable regression).  Now, we can grab the entire data set and analyze it as is.  Analyzing big data calls for different quantitative methods such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and network analysis among others.Nate Silver in his excellent The Signal and the Noise stated how the era of big data has not translated into superior predictions in many fields.  His research indicated that despite big data availability economic forecasting and financial markets predictions remain dismal.  Loannidis uncovered that two thirds of scientific findings documented in working papers can't be replicated.  In other words, Silver found a lot more noise than signal in many big data applications.Balancing Nate Silver's take, the authors uncover numerous areas where people have used big data very effectively.  A few entities are ubiquitous throughout the book because they are so enmeshed with the emergence of big data.  One is Google, the other is Oren Etzioni, a leading computer scientist that envisioned and implemented many different successful big data applications.  He co-founded Netbot, the first comparison-shopping website.  He founded ClearForest that extracts meaning from text documents.  He founded Farecast that predicts the price of airline tickets over time.  He founded Decide to assist shoppers buy electronic equipment.  Additionally, an early popularizer of big data is Steve Levitt.  In his books, Freakonomics and Super Freakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance, he shared many big data applications to figure out when sumo wrestler were cheating, when high school teachers were cheating to boost the score of their students among many other applications.The authors mention that big data is about three major shifts that have lifted constraints on traditional data analysis:1) The first is the ability to analyze vastly greater amounts of data with no more need for sampling.  This allows for drilling down and analyzing subcategories, which was not possible with smaller samples.2) The second is greater tolerance for messier data vs perfectly clean one.  There is a ton more information to be had when including the vast messy data.3) The third is a growing respect for correlations rather than a continuing quest for elusive causality.  Once we are not bent on explaining the ""why"" of everything we can grasp so much more of the ""what"" really happens.More data alone has often improved results in the absence of any changes in algorithm.  This is the case in chess.  Big Blue has now a repertoire of moves that make it unbeatable by humans.  Another area where more data is better is language translation.  Google translator is the superior translator across numerous languages because it relies on so much more data than any other translator.  Additionally, Douglas Merrill's ZestFinance has much improved credit decisions for lending to people without access to traditional credit using tens of variables not used by the standard FICO score models.The renewed focus on correlation instead of causation has fostered huge improvement in big data analytics.  Predictions based on correlations lie at the heart of big data.  One example is Amazon pioneering recommendation system item-to-item collaborative filtering that created associations between customer purchases.  Soon Netflix will develop a similar associative technology.  Now, a third of Amazon sales result from recommendations and 75% of Netflix new orders come from recommendations.  Google is the leader in big data usage, as it has innovated the secondary use of data.  First, it used data to improve its search results.  But, then it reused its search data to figure out flu trends worldwide at the nation, state, and city level.  It also reused its data to develop a world beating language translator among many other unrelated applications.  Google never stops learning from its data as it uncovers new innovative applications for it.  Target has used big data technology for some time.  Given our purchases, it can figure out customer behavior very precisely including who is pregnant and about when is their delivery date.  This helps Target its direct mail or email campaigns to customers.  With big data techniques you can also readily analyze nonlinear correlations such as the complex one between happiness and income.The authors mention that three types of big-data companies have cropped up.  Those types are: 1) the data, 2) the skills, and 3) the big-data mindset companies.The data-companies have developed huge data sets, but do not see analyzing that data as part of their business model.  Twitter is among those as it has licensed the usage of their data to others.The skills-companies do not have the data but have the mathematical capabilities to analyze the data on behalf of others.  Those are data-analytics firms such as Teradata.The big-data mindset companies are the innovators.  They come up with new concepts to leverage big data.  Every other website is such an innovator such as EBay, Zillow, Linkedin, Jetpac, etc...  Each developed an innovative online service leveraging big-data.  Companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook have strong if not leading positions in all three domains.Big data is becoming the most valuable intangible assets on company's balance sheet.  And, standard accounting principles are not equipped to measure its value.  The gap between the book value and market value of Google, Amazon, Facebook has reached absurd proportion.  And, intangibles are not just hot air.  Google's value is a lot more tied to the knowledge it derives from its trillions of searches than whatever is the depreciated cost of its hardware.  The rising value of big data is reflected in the acquisition markets.  In 2006, Microsoft bought Etzioni's Farecast for $110 million.  In 2008, Google paid $700 million to acquire Farecast's data supplier, ITA software.In many fields, the data experts increasingly supplant the former domain experts.  As conveyed in Michael Lewis Moneyball statisticians have taken over the scouts within the baseball league.  Similarly, at Google data experts have entirely replaced linguists in developing Google translator.The big data era calls for a new level of numeracy that includes mathematics, statistics, programming, network science, and other evolving quantitative methods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HXGTUPA9APA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544002695#wasThisHelpful","R1HXGTUPA9APA2","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Kehr looks at modern temperature records since 1970, he compares two Earth stations time series including the infamous CRU (subject of Climategate) vs two satellite time series.  You can clearly see that the controversial CRU series shows by far the most pronounced Global warming pattern (pg. 22).  And, the two satellite series that are deemed much more accurate (better coverage, better capture ocean temperature, not affected by the Urban Island Effect) show far less Global warming.  Unsurprisingly, the climatology community has relied more extensively on the CRU series.Kehr outlines what are the main causes of the changes in the Earth's temperature.  Those include:1) The geography of the Earth (composition of land vs ocean mix);2) The Climate or Milankovitch cycles of changes in solar energy imparted to the Earth over 100,000 year-periods (Milutin Milankovic was a Serbian engineer that first uncovered those long climate cycles);3) Energy Gap whereby the Earth looses more energy into space when it is warm than otherwise.  This is a mean reverting phenomenon that constraints change in temperatures and ensure our planet remains livable;4) Ocean temperature oscillations play a major role over short term temperature changes as we have experienced over the past few decades.Absent from this list of climate causal factor is CO2.  Kehr spends a good deal of the book explaining why that is the case.The Earth's geography is a very important climatic factor.  This is because land mass temperatures are a lot more volatile and have a more pronounced seasonality than oceans'.  That is what we mean when we say Minneapolis has a more continental climate than San Francisco.  Similarly, the Northern Hemisphere (NH) has a far greater seasonality than the Southern Hemisphere (SH) because the NH has a lot more land (39% land vs 61% ocean) than the SH (19% land vs 81% ocean).  As a result, the NH seasonal average temperature changes dominate the Earth's overall average temperature changes.Temperature changes at the poles are much greater than at the equator.  Given the NH greater temperature seasonality, it is not surprising the North Pole's ice melts extensively during the summer.  Meanwhile, the South Pole ice sheet is a lot more stable as the average temperature is colder and varies less.  Antarctica has had permanent ice sheets for over 34 million years.  Antarctica will remain much as it is today as long as its location and shape does not change and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) remains unchanged.The Earth's climate is very much driven by the amount of energy (Watts per square meter) the Earth receives from the Sun, called insolation, at the NH at the 65 degree latitude and north of it (65N).To understand the climate you have to study the Milankovitch cycles.  The Earth's climate has a very long pattern lasting a total of 100,000 years with four seasons.  The winter is the dominant season and lasts typically 70,000 years which is associated with a drop in insolation and temperature and returns the Earth to an Ice Age.  The other three seasons are compressed within the remaining 30,000 years.  So, to understand the present you have to go back 130,000 years to compare the current pattern of this season vs the previous same season. We are now in the Holocene Summer which is best compared with the previous one or the Eemian Summer.  Looking at our current warming century to project the climate is like considering a warm October day and predicting further rise in temperatures while we are heading into the winter.  It is more relevant to compare this year's October temperature to last year's October.During the rising temperature phase of the Eemian, the Earth's temperature was 3 to 5 degree Celsius higher than during the Holocene.  Yet, CO2 concentration was 270 ppm or over 100 ppm lower than currently.  Then, between 120,000 and 115,000 years ago the Earth's temperature dropped by 4 degree Celsius.  Yet, CO2 concentration remained steady at around 270 ppm.  This contradicts the Global Warming theory.  Kher states ""there is absolutely no indicator that the Earth is abnormally warm for where it is in the climate cycle.""Illustration 35 on page 63 is one of the many rebuttals of Global Warming theory.  We see the Eemian temperature drop abruptly by 10 degree Celsius over a 20,000 year period.  Meanwhile, CO2 concentration dropped 8,000 years after the temperature dropped.  What drove the change in temperature during the Eemian was not CO2 concentration but insolation at 65N (illustration 43. Pg. 78).  Insolation drove both the temperature change and the sea level change during the Eemian interglacial.  At one point, sea level dropped by 20 meters in a 5,000 year period.  And, CO2 levels had nothing to do with any of the above.The 100,000 year Milankovitch cycles are associated with long term changes in insolation caused by three different changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt.  Those are:1) Eccentricity.  It is the main force.  It slightly alters the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Thus, it directly affects the variation in insolation.  It follows a 100,000 year cycle;2) Obliquity, the varying angle of the tilt of the Earth (ranges from 21 to 25 degrees).  It affects the amount of insulation the Earth receives.  It has a 41,000 year cycle; and3) Precession that determines what season it is when the Earth is closest or farthest from the Sun.  One complete precession cycle takes 26,000 years.The Holocene has a flatter temperature behavior than the Eemian did because of a more moderate insulation pattern on both the way up and down.  The Eemian had more pronounced Milankovitch cycles than the Holocene did.  Nevertheless, based on those long term Milankovitch cycles the Earth will get colder.  3,000 years ago the insolation anomaly at 65N went negative.  And, each 1,000 year period since then has been cooler than the one before.  There is no better proof of long term cooling in the NH than the forming of many new glaciers.  Even if they are currently retreating (as part of a normal ebb and flow of retreats and advances), the main fact is that the majority of glaciers did not exist 4,000 years ago.  And, many of them are forming closer to the Equator.  This is typical when entering a very long cooling phase (Milankovitch cycle winter season is by far the longest).Changes in temperature always precede change in CO2 (instead of the reverse as suggested by Global Warming theory).  This is because CO2 water solubility decreases as water warms up.  As a result, when insolation warms the oceans; they release CO2 in the atmosphere.  Therefore, CO2 concentration rises after the temperature has already risen and not before.The natural volatility of temperature is very high.  Over 55 year period, the temperature standard deviation is 0.59 degree Celsius translating into a + or - 1.18 degree Celsius 95% Confidence Interval.  The total variation in the past 160 years has been within less than + or - one single standard deviation.  Thus, the current rise in temperature is well within natural variability.Sea level can rise abruptly in response to insolation that melts the land ice caps.  About 20,000 years ago within just a few thousands years sea levels rose by almost 100 meters in response to a rapid change in insolation.  None of those events were caused by change in CO2 concentration.  As mentioned, the change in CO2 is not a cause but an effect of the related changes in ocean temperatures.Within chapter 9, Kehr demonstrates on numerous counts why the theory of CO2 driven Global Warming is wrong.  The main one is that it does not explain any of the long term temperature history. CO2 levels remained relatively constant through the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the following Little Ice Age (LIA).  Meanwhile, those periods track much more closely the change in insolation.  The climatology community instead of looking at the historical evidence has manipulated tree proxy records to flatten out both the MWP and the LIA out of historical record.  That is exactly what Michael Mann did to create his famous hockey stick pattern (see page 144).  When the current rise in temperature is observed over just the past 2,000 years, the hockey stick pattern is erased by the true historical temperature volatility (pg. 133, 134).Geography and solar insolation are the driving forces in long term climate changes.Short term volatile climate changes are caused by several different oscillations in the ocean temperatures.  Those include El Nino/La Nina phenomenon (ENSO) that has a short cycle measured yearly.  ENSO alone causes a third of the very short term variation in the Earth's temperature.  The chart on page 150 shows that the change in ENSO leads rather precisely change in Earth's temperature by 6 months over the observed period (1979 to 2011).  Other ocean oscillations are important.  The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) that has a 10 to 20 year cycle and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) that has a 70 year cycle.  The warming between 1970 to 2000 is a perfect example of the short term warming that is likely caused by natural variations in the ocean cycles.CO2 has a negligible impact on temperature.  The total Greenhouse Effect (GHE) accounts for 120 watts per square meter of energy transfer that translates into 33 degree Celsius of temperature.  Without the GHE, our planet could not support complex life forms.  However, over 80% of the GHE is caused by water vapor and evaporation.  CO2 accounts for only 3.3 W/m square.  And a doubling of CO2 concentration will cause only a 10% increase in the total effect of CO2 or from 3.3 to 3.6 W/m square.  This translates into less than a 0.1 degree Celsius change in temperature.  Meanwhile, some climatologists suggest that a doubling in CO2 level would cause temperature to rise by up to 6 degree Celsius or more than 60 times what the correct energy transfer calculations dictate.There is another reason why CO2 has very little impact on climate.  It absorbs only a very narrow range of radiation wavelength (between 13 and 16 microns; meanwhile the range in the atmosphere is from 1 to 40.  Chart on page 236).  And, at current concentration levels CO2 already absorbs close to 100% of the radiation wavelength it could absorb.The GHE has a strong seasonality.  The Earth has the highest GHE while CO2 levels are the lowest (pg. 216).  That also contradicts Global Warming.Another important causal factor in climate change is the Energy Gap the Earth experiences.  When the Earth cools, it is not only associated with a Milankovitch cycle decline in insolation, but also a rising energy gap where the Earth is loosing more energy into space.  It is measured as outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) energy loss in W/m square.  And, it is driven by temperature.  The higher the temperature the greater the OLR energy loss.  On pg. 262 Kehr shows a linear regression that perfectly fits the historical data between temperature and rising OLR loss or energy gap.  This physical phenomenon contributes to explaining the historical swings between the high MWP and the low LIA.  Meanwhile, Global Warming does not as CO2 did not change much during those periods.Both the trend in insolation and energy gap in the current Holocene period match well the ones of the Eemian period at the same point in the cycle.  And, they mean only one thing.  With both a decline in insolation and a rise in the Energy Gap, our climate temperature over the long term is in a downward trend that started about 3,000 years ago (when insolation anomaly went negative and Energy Gap rose commensurately.  See pg 260-261).  And, CO2 driven Global warming will have no impact in delaying this long term trend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH5HPX9ECX9R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984782915#wasThisHelpful","RH5HPX9ECX9R7","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the European counterpart to Mark Zandi's book, Paying the Price: Ending the Great Recession and Beginning a New American Century.  They both cover the aftermath of the financial crisis and the prospective economic outlook.  While Zandi is focused on the US, including its government policies that facilitated a slow but sustainable recovery; Authers is focused on the Euro Zone, and its incapability of resolving the ensuing Euro crisis because of its dysfunctional structure.  Authers shows how the Euro Zone was an accident waiting to happen.  This is for two reasons.First, at the onset, the member countries' economies were too divergent for a single monetary policy.  Authers compares Spain and Germany's economic growth (fig. 1.1 pg 19) and inflation (fig. 1.2 pg 20) since the Euro's onset in 1999 with the policy rate level (ECB repo rate). The ECB rate was chronically too low for Spain's economy that was heating up with high inflation.  Meanwhile, it was too high for Germany that was growing slower with little inflation.  The Euro Zone will exacerbate this economic divergence problem by rapidly increasing its membership to 17 countries with disparate economic momentum and fiscal discipline.  Thus, instead of countries economies converging over time, they actually became increasingly divergent.Second, European countries let their respective banking system reach gargantuan asset size relative to their respective economy. While banks' assets represent only 81% of GDP in the US. This same ratio is 225% for Greece, 294% for Germany, 416% for France, and a staggering 1,059% for Ireland.  Thus, those banking systems became far too large to be bailed out by their host countries.  Also, those banks were way too leveraged.  At the end of 2007, just before the crisis US banks had a total leverage of 12.2 times (Assets/Equity multiple).  Meanwhile, French banks had a leverage of 36 and German ones a leverage of 42.The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008 triggered a worldwide liquidity crisis that caused the European banking system to nearly collapse.  This greatly impaired the perceived creditworthiness of their respective sovereign countries.Authers illustrates how the emerging markets lead by China came out unscathed.  This was due to China's expansive monetary and fiscal policies.  Meanwhile, the Euro Zone countries having pretty much lost sovereignty over both their monetary and fiscal policies struggled to respond effectively to the crisis.  Thus, emerging markets fared better and their stock market became decoupled (see Fig 3.1 pg 47).China's rising economic power became problematic for the Euro Zone.  First, it competed and beat it in exports.  Second, it reinvested some of its foreign exchange export earnings in the Euro.  Thus, it rendered the Euro too expensive relative to the Dollar (Fig 4.1 pg. 57) which hurt European exports and acted as a restrictive monetary policy on an already beaten down European economy.As reviewed by both Authers and Zandi, the US handled its banking crisis better.  The US quickly recapitalized the banking system with a $250 billion equity injection from TARP.  Next, it implemented rigorous stress tests that restored investors' confidence.  It implemented stronger deposit insurance and short-term liability guarantees.  The Federal Reserve monetary policy became aggressively expansionary.  The two rounds of the Fed's Quantitative Easing and Operation Twist caused a strong and sustainable rally in the stock market and shored up investors' confidence (Fig. 9.2 pg 133).  Yet, the stock market's valuation is still reasonable in terms of 10 year P/E ratio (Fig 9.5 pg 141).By contrast, the Euro Zone policies to resolve the Euro crisis have been either nonexistent or ineffective.  One spectacular failure was the European stress test equivalent with numerous banks failing right after passing their stress test.  This jeopardized investors' confidence.  Thus, European banking systems are still weak,  while, the US one is better capitalized than ever and has entirely repaid TARP funds.Euro Zone countries have numerous economic weaknesses.  But, they are different.  Greece is plagued by a large inefficient public sector coupled with rampant tax evasion translating in chronic large Deficits, and unsustainable rising Debt levels.  Ireland suffered from its 2008 decision to guarantee all bank deposits.  As a result, banks' growth became excessive.  And, related Government debt to shore up troubled banks and the economy rose abruptly from 25% of GDP in 2007 to 98% in 2010.  Portugal is plagued with low productivity and a stagnant economy.  Spain experienced a full fledged property bubble financed by the equivalent of an S&L sector that went bust.  Its fiscal position is nearly impossible to shore up due to the Spanish ""Regions"" exerting too much fiscal power.  Italy is plagued with low productivity, a stagnant economy, issues of political governance (Silvio Berlusconi, was a disaster), and a huge Government debt level.  Its Debt/GDP ratio has been above 100% since 1992.  This has rendered Italy's fiscal position very vulnerable to interest rate levels.Many of those countries experienced rising interest rates rendering their Government debt unserviceable.  Once Government bond yields crossed the 7% level (7% being faster than nominal GDP growth renders debt level unsustainable), it forced several of those Governments to ask for bail outs (Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland) in part to recapitalize their banks that were too large for their host countries to handle.  Those bail outs were undertaken by collective reserve funds (European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)) funded by other Euro Zone members and the IMF.  Other countries too large to bail out like Italy became the beneficiaries of large bond purchases from the European Central Bank (ECB) to bring their interest down to a serviceable level.  Some of the bail outs have been associated with debt restructuring reducing bond values by up to 70% for the private sector in the case of Greece.  Even after all those interventions, Greece remains shut out of the capital markets with their 10 year bond yields still hovering above 10%.  But, that's down from nearly 50% in early 2012 (Fig 7.2 pg 105).The countries receiving bail outs or benefiting from ECB bond purchases are subject to various Austerity programs.  So far, the latter have caused Depression level unemployment rates and economic contractions in many of the peripheral countries.  Those countries are caught in a Debt Deflation trap (see Irving Fisher's seminal The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions).In the last chapter, Authers contemplates the Euro uncertain outlook.  He contemplates four different scenarios.  The first one entails a much closer fiscal integration.  Countries would concede even more control over their fiscal policies than they already do in exchange for Euro Zone wide backing of their bonds and their bank deposit insurance.  Politically, this is unlikely to happen fully because both peripheral and core countries are against it.  The second scenario is for the peripheral countries to be kicked out of the Euro Zone.  The damage this would do to the Global financial system and the European economy would be massive.  This would be an involuntary desperate move.  The third scenario could ensue from the second one.  It is a disorderly collapse of the Euro Zone.  Authers suggests this could very well cause a Great Depression II.  The fourth scenario is the most realistic.  And, that is for the ECB to print money by buying sovereign bonds (like US Quantitative Easing).  This would lower the Euro foreign exchange level enhance exports, reduce imports, and boost economic growth.I found one error.  Authers states in 2010 Greece Debt represented only 34% of GDP (pg 102).  Instead it represented 167% of GDP (source: Eurostat).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AUG889RN7K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133133710#wasThisHelpful","R14AUG889RN7K6","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is because the US ability to attract and retain highly skilled and entrepreneurial individuals worldwide is at the essence of its success.  As long as the US can maintain an economic and cultural climate favorable to entrepreneurship, the US can still remain the leader in the innovation of markets for new products and services.The author documents that the US magnet for talent has broken down due to impairing immigration policies. This is at the same time as other countries have far strengthened their own talent magnet.  Historically, the US has attracted the best and the brightest and made it relatively easy to stay.  But, this situation has rapidly deteriorated.The author firsthand experience is interesting.  He came from Australia with a degree in computer sciences in 1980.  Within days of his arrival, he had applied and gotten a job with Xerox.  Within a short 18 months he had gotten a green card.  This will provide him total freedom to fulfill his full potential.  And, he will soon found two successful high tech companies: Seer Technologies and Relativity Technologies creating hundreds of jobs as a result.The author indicates that he could not have replicated his own success today.  This is because he would have to wait for a decade to get a green card.  Stuck in near corporate servitude with a temporary H-1B visa, he would be not only tied to his sponsoring employer but also tied to the specific job associated with his green card application.  He would never have started his two companies and hundreds of jobs would not have been created.  If he would have to start today, given current circumstances he would have stayed in Australia.  This is obviously wrong.Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York City, has called our immigration policy suicidal.  This is the case because if the US can't attract worldwide talent, it has lost its main competitive edge.  The US, having the highest living standard, precludes it from ever being the low cost manufacturer of the World.  (Germany's manufacturing prowess overcomes the high living standard handicap by earmarking the majority of its youth for trade manufacturing schools instead of college.  That's a solution the US will never accept).  The US has to position its economy as the one that constantly renews itself by developing new high margin markets.  It can't do that if it is impairing its ability to attract high skilled talent.  Yet, that is exactly what it is doing right now.Let's look at a few numbers to better understand the situation.  US citizens account for only 4% of engineering degrees worldwide; Asia (mainly India and China) account for 56% of them.  Two thirds of H-1B applicants are issued for related positions in engineering and high technology.  And, India and China account for two thirds of those.  Thus, over 44% of H-1B applications go to Indian and Chinese engineers.  This makes perfect sense since those two nations provide the majority of engineer graduates.  However, the US offers only 140,000 green cards per year and limits any nation to only a 7% allocation of such green cards.  This means that both China and India with each a population of over 1.2 billion providing the majority of the engineering talent worldwide get only 10,000 green card each, the same allotment as Iceland (pop 320,000) or even Liechtenstein (pop. 35,000).  This situation is absurd.  As a result, both Indian and Chinese engineers with H-1B visas have to wait around a decade to get a green card if ever.  Many will give up and return to their home countries with thriving local opportunities.  The author with other researchers estimate there are currently over 1.2 million highly skilled workers waiting in limbo for their green card.  This stifles their entrepreneurship and productivity.The author has documented that the slide in immigrant fostered entrepreneurship has already started.  Just a few years ago, immigrants co-founded 52.4% of Silicon Valley companies.  Within his most recent 2012 survey, this percentage had abruptly dropped to 43.9%.  Similarly, the US share of total patent filings has declined from 42.8% in 1995 to 27.4% in 2010.  That's even though foreigners account for a growing % of US patent filed (51% in 2011 vs only 18% in 1964).If the US is concerned about the emerging economic competition from China and India what could it do?  Probably one of the best strategies would be to attract and retain its best and brightest [from China and India] to cause a positive brain drain in favor of the US.  Meanwhile, what the US does is actually attract bright Chinese and Indian minds as students and then kick them back home a short while after graduating and acquiring some training in the US.  That's like US foreign aid in human capital.  This could only accelerate China and India's economic rise relative to the US.  In 2011, 160,000 students left China for the US.  But, the number of graduates returning to China amounted to 180,000 in 2011 up from only 50,000 in 2008 (pg 42-43).  The reverse brain drain has started.Economic competition is all about international human capital.  And, based on immigration policy related to the skilled the US has already lost this race to many other countries such as Australia, Canada, China, Germany, and Singapore (Chapter 5).  Australia with only a tenth of the US population issues nearly as many green card equivalents!  All those countries have immigration policies related to the skills that are far more hospitable and inviting than the US.  Their policies have much in common.  First, they recognize and value human capital (their immigration policies are highly selective on that count).  Second, they provide permanent residency permits a lot easier and faster than the US does for the targeted skilled workers.  In many of those countries, immigrants can apply for permanent residency before moving to the country and often receive such permit while still being in school before entering the labor force.  This contrast with the 10 year purgatory Indian and Chinese engineers suffer in the US.The author does not mention India among those countries fostering immigration.  This is for a simple reason: it has an abundance of homegrown talent.  And, India has far improved the local opportunities for such talent.  Bangalore rivals Silicon Valley.  Major US high tech companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have all huge operations in India.  As a result, Indians increasingly stay home.  From 1964 to 2001, 30% of Indian graduates from the Institutes of Technology went to the US.  Between 2002 and 2008 that number declined to only 9%.  This rapid decline is due to both faster relative economic growth in India and really restricting US immigration policies for Indians.The author's recommendations to fix our immigration policy make a lot of sense.  They include boosting the number of green cards available to skilled immigrants.  The 7% cap per nation should be eliminated.  The spouses of H-1B holders should be allowed to work and have driving licenses.  H-1B visas should not be restricted to a specific employer, and related green card applications should not be restricted to a specific job.  Those recommendations seem so obvious and humane, it is sad that they are even necessary.  Meanwhile, the immigration debate in Washington is solely dominated by the issue of the porous border with Mexico.  The US only ignores the issue of skilled immigration raised by the author at its own economic risk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/REF47B7B4K555/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613630212#wasThisHelpful","REF47B7B4K555","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is similar to Steven Levitt's Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.), Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: ""On Robustness and Fragility"", and James Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds.  All four books explore the intersection of data, human behavior, and outcomes.  They explain how to quantify outcomes within the financial markets, professional sports or elections.This book is especially interesting because Nate Silver has honed firsthand his statistical skills onto numerous domains including professional poker, baseball performance forecasting (he developed one of the best software program to do that), political elections (his ""fivethirtyeight"" blog).  And, when he is not a firsthand practitioner he is a first class investigator.The first seven chapters cover the errors and successes people have had in forecasting in various disciplines.  Chapter eight is the most pedagogical, as the author explains the basics of Bayes Theorem that he considers as an overall solution to many of the errors we make in forecasting.  The last five chapters focus on Bayesian thinking within various disciplines.Nate Silver's coverage of the credit rating agencies ""Catastrophic failure of prediction"" (first chapter title) is excellent.  In a single sentence on page 13, he captures the cause of the financial crisis: ""In advance of the financial crisis, the system was so highly leveraged that a single lax assumption in the credit rating agencies played a huge role in bringing down the whole global financial system.""  Silver states that the AAA rated CDOs were deemed to have a default rate of only 0.12%.  The actual default rate was 28% or over 200 times greater!  This was because the rating agencies missed out the correlation between mortgage default rates at different locations when a nationwide home price downturn hit (see figure 1.2 on page 28.  Watch out that he mislabeled column 3 and 4 from the right).  Silver assesses that overall leverage was too high during the housing bubble.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had a debt-to-equity leverage of 70-to-1.  Lehman Brothers and other investment banks were leveraged over 30-to-1.  Borrowers had often loan-to-value ratios of 100% on their homes.  The volume of credit default swaps, MBS, CDOs represented 30 to 60 times the volume of home sales during the bubble years (fig. 1.5 page 35).  Nate Silver summarizes the errors made.  Investors trusted the rating agencies.  The rating agencies assumed home prices would never decline on a nationwide basis because they never had since the Great Depression.  Lenders and borrowers believed rising home prices would bail them out through refinancing.  Policymakers believed the financial system had enough capital and was self-disciplined.  And, economists completely missed the ensuing severe recession.Nate Silver focuses next on political predictions.  This field of experts was so bad at predicting it motivated him to enter it by starting his fivethirtyeight blog.  He documents their failings extensively.  Within this chapter he refers to the theory of Philip Tetlock, professor of psychology and political science at Berkeley.  Tetlock had surveyed predictions of experts in various fields.  And, he categorized them within two archetypes: the hedgehogs and the foxes.  The hedgehogs are dogmatic, rarely change their minds, and are very confident of their forecast.  The foxes are just the opposite.  They update their forecasts as often as new information warrants it.  As a result, they make better forecasts.The chapter on baseball is one of the best because of Silver's extensive firsthand experience.  He uncovers many concepts applicable to many sports such as  the age-curve of baseball performance (pg. 81).  All sports have a predetermined age-curve.  Actually, every single aspects of life including life itself have predetermined age-curves.  His description of what it takes to be a successful professional baseball player (pg. 97) has also surprisingly broad applications.  The conclusion of the chapter is also fascinating.  It describes baseball management as a competitive arms race of intelligence gathering to extract small competitive edges.  And, that those competitive edges are short-lived.  That's a very interesting application of the Efficient Market Hypothesis.The chapter on economists documents how inaccurate their forecasts are.  The majority can't forecast a recession that has already started as they missed out on the three most recent ones (1990, 2001, 2007).  In November 2007, the average economic forecast was 2.4% real GDP growth in 2008.  Instead, real GDP shrank by -3.3%.  Economists assigned only a 1-in-2000 chance of the economy shrinking that much.  Yet, home prices were already declining.  Foreclosures had picked up.  Bear Stearns had gone belly up six months ago.  Those were powerful signals the housing and financial markets were on the edge of a cliff.  Also, economists are way too confident.  The few times you can extract confidence intervals from the economic profession they are invariably way too narrow because they underestimate the error level within their forecasts (pg. 182).  Nate Silver states that: ""this property of overconfident prediction has been observed also in medical research, political science, finance, and psychology"" (pg. 183).  Despite our having so much more data and computer power at our hands, economic forecasting has not improved since 1968.  This is because our underlying understanding of cause and effects has not changed much since.Chapter 8 introduces Bayes's Theorem.  Here Nate Silver often refers to a very good book on the subject: The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne.Chapter 9 and 10 about chess and poker are excellent.  Kasparov was ultimately beaten by a computer bug.  IBM Big Blue made a move late in the last game that did not make any sense (the team who programmed it confirmed it was due to a small programming bug).  Kasparov who was in a vulnerable position could not figure out that move and in despair resigned the game and lost the series.  The Pareto principle of prediction on page 312 and 314 and the ensuing economics of poker are really interesting.  Poker winning are heavily dependent on the one worst player at a table.  If he leaves, the winnings are a lot harder to reap.Chapter 11 on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is excellent.  Nate Silver states that the stock market is efficient most of the time, although it is never perfectly efficient (that would preclude a market).  But, it can be wildly inefficient on few occasions associated with bubbles and crashes.  Nate Silver demonstrates how both technical analysis and fundamental analysis do not beat the market over the long run.  Fig 11.3 on page 340 shows no correlation between the performance of mutual funds over the 2002 to 2006 period vs over the 2007 to 2011 period.  Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.  Next, Silver refers to Robert Shiller in showing the market is not as efficient as the EMH entails.  Shiller looked at the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 over a trailing 10 year period and looked at prospective returns.  And, the longer the period contemplated the greater the negative correlation between trailing P/E levels and future average yearly returns.  This suggests that the market can get overvalued.  But, the return correction is not apparent until looking at average return over a 10 to 20 year period.  Next, Nate Silver refers to the works of Richard Thaler and Daniel Kahneman in behavioral economics to outline how market traders are not perfectly rational.  They suffer from herd mentality, overconfidence, and being overly emotional rendering their trading pro-cyclical.So, if the market is not so efficient, can you beat it?  Probably not.  On page 345, Nate Silver demonstrates how a hypothetical investor with perfect timing over a decade (1976-1986) would get killed by very small transaction costs.  Even though this investor would handily beat the stock market before transaction costs, he would wipe out most of his capital after transaction costs.  Silver next tests a prudent investment strategy over the 1970 to 2009 period.  He assumes an investor is prudent and sells his position in the S&P 500 index whenever it had declined 25% from its peak and reinvests whenever it recovered 90% of its value.  Such an investor would have earned only 2.6% per year vs close to 10% for a simple buy-and-hold strategy.  Nate Silver does believe several hedge funds can beat the market.  But, they have intellectual and technological resources that no retail investor and few mutual funds can match.Chapter 12 on climate change is really interesting.  He differentiates between where scientists agree and disagree.  They all agree that the greenhouse effect exists and keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be; that temperatures have risen over the past century; that greenhouse gases have contributed to that trend; and that water vapor is by far the most potent greenhouse gas (not CO2 as the Media conveys).  The majority of scientists agree that rising CO2 concentration does contribute to rising temperature.  But, there is a debate regarding how much.  Where the scientific community is more divergent is regarding climate models and projections.  They acknowledge that Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth deterministic apocalyptic message was way off base.Nate Silver explains why there is much uncertainty regarding climate models' projections.  One uncertainty is figuring out CO2 levels 100 years down the road.  Another uncertainty is getting the causal relationships right (there is a lot more than CO2 at play).  Another uncertainty concerns whether those models are programmed correctly.  Within the vast quantities of computer codes, are there a few bugs that contribute to generating erroneous forecasts?  Nate Silver reviews the prediction of the IPCC's 1990 model and observes that temperatures have not risen as fast as the model predicted.  Current temperatures are below the model's 95% confidence interval.  This lead the IPCC to reduce their baseline temperature increase from 3 degree Celsius per century in 1990 to 1.8 degree in 1995.  On page 407, Silver comes up with an interesting application of Bayes theorem applied to rising temperature predictions.The last chapter on terrorism is intriguing.  Terrorist attacks follow a similar Power Law as earthquakes.  The frequency of events declines exponentially with increase in intensity.  More violent events are much rarer than lesser ones.  But, the few major events dominate the data in human casualties.  For instance, 9/11 represented more than half of the total fatalities from terror attacks in NATO countries since 1979.  Thus, it is worth exploring means of mitigating the impact of such events.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STBWWS4U1Q48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420411X#wasThisHelpful","R2STBWWS4U1Q48","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Zandi is not your usual economist.  He is the founder of the best macroeconomics modeling and consulting business (Moody's Analytics). He is able to simulate the behavior of the overall economy as well as anyone else.  Zandi has contributed to the formulating and testing of many of the Government policies undertaken during this recent financial crisis.  He has sat across the table from many key policymakers.  Given his unique background Zandi gives us an insider look at the recent financial crisis and its aftermath.In summary, Zandi indicates that the US went through a historically wrenching economic shock.  And, if not for a very successful combination of expansive fiscal and monetary policies the Great Recession would have turned into the Great Depression II.  Also, he indicates that currently the US is rebuilding a very strong economic foundation.  The severe deleveraging has nearly run its course.  American companies are as financially strong and competitive as ever. Commercial banks are now very well capitalized.The Great Recession was a historical event given its magnitude and worldwide impact.  As Zandi outlines on page 151, financial losses related to the housing and financial crisis totaled $2.6 trillion in the US alone.  Half that amount was suffered by banks.  And, half of those overall losses were caused by drop in homes values related to defaults on residential mortgages.  But, the financial system also incurred huge losses in consumer credit, commercial real estate, and corporate credits.  Those accounted for the other half of the $2.6 trillion in losses.By the Fall of 2008, the housing market was cratering and taking down the financial system and the economy.Zandi mentions that at first Government policy responses were poor.  In September 2008 the Government took over Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae which immediately wiped out shareholders.  By now, investors are fleeing for the exit which in turn caused Lehman Brothers to suffer a liquidity squeeze as no one wanted to roll over its short term debt.  The Federal Reserve refused to extend credit to Lehman.  And, the latter had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.  In doing so, both stockholders and bondholders were wiped out.  By now, the credit markets were frozen.  The spread between LIBOR and US Treasuries jumped by 400 basis points as banks did not even trust lending to each other overnight let alone lend to anyone else.  That's a death knell for the economy at large.  Zandi states that the Government takeover of Fannie and Freddie (F & F) was the trigger for this chain of event.  The Government instead should have temporarily guaranteed F & F debt and injected a minority equity position so they remained solvent.  The Fed should have extended credit to Lehman to maintain liquidity throughout the capital markets.To their credit, policymakers self-corrected and responded well to the ensuing crisis.  They learned from the Lehman debacle.  Within just a few weeks in late 2008 the FDIC merged Merrill Lynch into Bank of America, Washington Mutual into JP Morgan, and Wachovia into Wells Fargo at no cost to the taxpayer.  On the second try Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), as the stock market tanked when they failed to pass it the first time.  And, TARP will turn out to be the most successful fiscal bail out of all time.  As Zandi itemizes it on pg. 38, the $700 billion TARP ultimately cost taxpayers only $57 billion, only 8% of its original commitment.  This is in good part due to earning a $27 billion profit on the $250 billion stake the Government temporarily invested in the banks.  The banks repaid the $250 billion within months.  And, the Government made the $27 billion profit on the resale of warrants they acquired as part of their investment in the banks.  Also, the combination of TARP and the new Stress Testing regulation for banks successfully shored up the banking system.  Europe in 2010 tried to follow similar policies but failed.  The European bank stress tests were not credible as banks readily failed right after being certified by the stress tests.  Also, those tests were opaque and not disclosed contrary to the far greater transparency of the US ones.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC temporarily pretty much guaranteed the debt from all banks, financial institutions, money market funds, and commercial paper.  The Federal Reserve also brought the Fed Funds rate down to close to 0% and purchased large quantities of Treasuries to bring down long term interest rates and mortgage backed securities (MBS) to replace the securitization market for MBS that had shut down and shore up housing finance to put a floor on the housing market.In just a few months in late 2008 to early 2009, US policymakers achieved more than their European counterparts over the past four years.  This is due to two reasons:The first one is competence.  Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is the number one contemporary expert on the Great Depression and all the related policy failures that pretty much caused it, including tight fiscal and monetary policies to shore up the US trade balance to maintain the Gold Standard in place at the time.  Thus, Zandi states the US could not have had a better leader to guide us through the crisis.  Meanwhile, Europe is lead by German's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is imposing fiscal austerity on the countries within the Euro Zone that are already experiencing Great Depressions of their own with unemployment rates above 20% (Greece, Spain).The second one is sovereignty.  The US has full control of its own fiscal and monetary policies.  Meanwhile, the member countries of the Euro Zone do not.  And, their economic fate is more often in the hands of Mrs. Merkel.The large $1.4 trillion fiscal stimuli implemented over several years were successful.  About 57% of it came from Government spending and 43% from tax cuts.  Zandi (pg. 103 & 104) assessed that the economic multipliers associated with the spending initiatives (ranging from 1.3 to 1.7) were far higher than for the permanent tax cuts (0.3 to 0.5) and also higher than for temporary tax cuts (0.8 to 1.4).  Thus, it was a good thing the fiscal package was more tilted towards Government spending.  Zandi leaning on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office states that the unemployment rate would be several percentage points higher and GDP growth very likely chronically negative if not for those fiscal interventions (pg. 110).The Federal Reserve expansion of its balance sheet is routinely criticized.  People fear it will ignite inflation.  They are concerned about its ""monetizing the debt"" by purchasing Treasuries from the US Government.  However, Zandi explains that monetizing the debt is no concern when the economy is experiencing high unemployment and excess industrial capacity.  Also, the Federal Reserve balance sheet is only replacing the securitization market that has nearly evaporated since the onset of the crisis in 2008.  Eventually, when the securitization market recovers the Fed will shrink back its balance sheet with no impact on overall liquidity throughout the financial system.  Also, the Fed's balance sheet relative to GDP is actually far smaller than its counterparts in Japan and Europe (pg 61).In the last chapter, Zandi shares why the US is in far better shape than we think.  First, households have markedly reduced their debt service burden since 2008 (figure 9.4 pg. 204).  Meanwhile, commercial banks capital cushion is stronger than ever at nearly 10% of assets (fig. 9.5 pg. 205).  Additionally, US corporations are in very strong financial shape as they have markedly reduced their leverage, improved their cash flow, and reduced their exposure to short term debt (fig. 9.6 pg. 207).  Also, US productivity has accelerated since 2008.  US unit labor costs have decreased since 2000 (fig 10.4 pg 237).  As a result, US companies are increasingly competitive in the international arena.  Over the same period, European unit labor costs have skyrocketed upward.  The US trend in this regard is even far superior than Germany, the European export powerhouse (fig 8.8 pg. 191).  Zandi even indicates that if the US sticks with current laws, it could well regain control of its fiscal house as he anticipates the US Debt/GDP ratio would decline from 75% currently to under 60% by 2025 (fig. 10.2 pg 226).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ324B9Z9V7WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0137047983#wasThisHelpful","RZ324B9Z9V7WM","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently read Hanna Rosin excellent book The End of Men: And the Rise of Women. She uncovers how young women are thriving in college and grad schools as they account for nearly 60% of college students and earn an equal share of college and graduate degrees in most disciplines.  This 60%/40% ratio in earning university degrees is causing young women to dominate the ranks of young professionals and managers everywhere.Times have changed.  Unionized blue collar middle class manufacturing jobs for the uneducated have been replaced by information based service jobs requiring a much higher level of education and people skill.  College has become the new high school as a path to the middle class.  Far more women are following that path than men.While Rosin focused on the divergence between men and women's fate starting with the 60%/40% in college, Whitmire explains how that radical divergence emerged over time due to strong causal gender differences since day 1 of kindergarten.Girls have more developed linguistic skills than boys at an earlier age.  Young girls have 11% more neurons devoted to language.  Brain scans show girls language areas at three and a half year old being as developed as boys' five year old.  Until recently this huge development gap did not matter.  This is because the early grades learning curve was slow enough that everybody over time would catch up.  It also did not matter because one could do just fine with just a high school degree.  But, those days are long gone.In 1989 the k-12 educational environment accelerated the learning curve.  Schools curricula were upgraded to follow a rigorous college preparation track.  The demand on linguistic skills have become far more stressful at an early age.  In this more demanding environment, girls with earlier linguistic capacity have fared just fine.  Meanwhile, boys have been lost with no way to catch up.  Yet, Joseph Torgensen, director of the Florida Center for Reading Research, has calculated that any child who is just five months behind at the end of first grade has only a 20% probability of ever catching up to grade level.  And, the majority of these laggards are boys for the mentioned neurological reasons.  When the school curriculum was overhauled, the education establishment gave no thought to the huge gender gap in early linguistic skill.  Now, this gender gap has translated into the 60%/40% ratio through all levels of academia and professions.Boys experience a crisis in 9th grade as they come out of k-8 unprepared for high school.  They fail in their freshman year and are not ready to take the national standard tests in 10th grade.  So, schools hold them back in 9th grade.  This is called the ""9th grade bulge.""  And, the second time around demoralized they don't fare any better.  In most States, they have also reached the age limit of mandatory schooling.  And, they drop out of high school.  Judith Kleinfeld from the University of Alaska, studying national data, has figured out that students entering 9th grade reading significantly below grade level are 20 times more likely to drop out.  This 9th grade bulge explains not only boys higher high school drop out rate but everything else that follows including lower college attendance, lower college graduation rate, and lesser participation in the professions.Whitmire has conducted extensive research for years interviewing tens if not hundreds of social scientists, education experts, school principals, and teachers.  He has traveled to Canada, Europe, Australia to study this gender gap worldwide (apparently young girls and boys brains are neurologically wired pretty much the same everywhere).  And, among all those experts one stands out: Judith Kleinfeld, a social scientist at the University of Alaska who has studied this problem for decades.  Whitmire information dense appendix titled ""The Facts about Boys"" is entirely sourced from one of Kleinfeld's excellent paper ""The State of American Boyhood"" that looks at the 60/40 phenomenon from every angle through k-12 and beyond.  Kleinfeld wrote another relevant paper titled: ""No Map to Manhood.""  This paper indicates that young men are far more immature, unrealistic, and genuinely clueless about the realities of our information intensive labor markets.  Meanwhile, young women know very much what they want, plan for it, and get it.  Both papers make for excellent supplemental reading to this book.Whitmire's analysis of the problem is so crystal clear and concrete (the early linguistic gap leading to lifelong gender gap everywhere).  Many countries are fully aware of it and have acted upon developing solutions at the national levels.  Those countries include the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand among others.  Some of those countries have researched this issue for over a decade.  Many schools overseas and a few in the US have found how to remedy this gap.  It consists in far more rigorous training in phonics at an early age, continuous coaching in linguistic skills through the later grades, and uncompromising discipline regarding homework submission.The US is way behind on this issue as it has completely ignored it at the federal level. Why is that?  It is in part due to political correctness gone mad.  Somehow, it is perfectly OK to study and recognize that minorities and low income populations need assistance to achieve adequate literacy.  But, it is not to figure out the same on a gender basis and realize that boys need assistance too.  Whitmire indicates that the gender gap is getting as big as the racial one.  A few social scientists using national grants and backing from the Department of Education have tried researching this issue only to see their project torpedoed in midstream as deemed too controversial.  Any research has been privately funded by foundations, universities, and think tanks.  And, so far they have had no influence whatsoever on federal government policy.  Whenever the gender gap issue is raised at the national level, the Government readily bifurcates it into a race and income issue or a sense that we should do something for girls too.Whitmire has demonstrated abundantly that the gender gap is not a race and income issue.  The gender gap is nearly as pronounced in all white high-income neighborhoods.  It is as pronounced throughout Scandinavia and many countries with homogenous populations.The US Government's mindset is stuck fighting the last war.  Back in the 1980s, the concern was how girls were far behind boys in math and science.  However, so much progress has been made that this math/science gap has pretty much disappeared.  Meanwhile, the huge and rising literacy skills gap is completely ignored.  The Government is focused on the wrong gap that is twenty years out-of-date.  Whitmire indicates the gap will take decades to fix.  But, that's assuming we recognize it.The way universities have dealt with this crisis has been by conducting a stealthy affirmative action favoring boys.  Whitmire has documented that several schools (that took the risk of divulging this information) accept boys 12 or more percentiles higher than girls in an effort to get closer to a 50/50 ratio.  Let's say a selective school overall acceptance rate is 40%.  Then, the corresponding acceptance rate for girls would be 34% (34th percentile) and for boys it would be 46% (46th percentile or 12 percentiles above the girls).  That is a huge difference!  This probably corresponds to boys being accepted with average GPAs a quarter to half a point lower and SAT scores potentially a 100 points or more lower than girls.  Whitmire, out of near despair, in an Op-Ed piece recommended that this stealthy affirmative action be continued until our k-12 education system is upgraded to reduce this gender gap.  His two daughters, two successful college students, assertively took the other side on the Op-Ed page.  I am sure the Whitmire family has had pretty animated dinner conversations on the subject as one can see both sides of the argument.  One thing for sure is that this stealthy affirmative action is no more than a band-aid solution.  Whitmire knows it and makes numerous more serious solutions (the usual stuff done by the few successful schools mentioned earlier).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TP26DI1GOEGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814420176#wasThisHelpful","R3TP26DI1GOEGS","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Minsky covers a couple of disjointed topics in the most confusing way.  The first one is how everyone so far got Keynes wrong.  He covers that in the first couple of chapters.  In doing so, Minsky criticizes a bunch of neo Keynesian models developed by eminent economists that invariably miss out on one or more of Keynes' key concepts.  Some of those include: 1) the concept of uncertainty associated with any complex economic systems that renders quantitative models futile; 2) the volatility of capital investments that by its nature leads to unstable and less than full employment; 3) wage rigidity is not the sole problem underlying excessive unemployment.  If wages were elastic, it would eventually exacerbate unemployment levels even more; and 4) a capitalist economy within an uncertain time vector left to its own resort is by its nature unstable and transits in unpredictable ways from one state to another (expantion, boom, crisis, depression, stagnation, recovery etc...).The second topic covered through most of the remainder of the book consists in the correct interpretation of Keynes according to Minsky and the integration of Minsky's own theory of crisis within Keynes' framework.  Minsky attempts to do both simultaneously.  And, he generates a rather awkward narrative.  Minsky acknowledges numerous times that Keynes did not advance a logical model of bubbles and crises.  He also adds that Keynes ignored the dynamics of the debt side of the balance sheet of households, companies, banks, and governments.  And, that's where Minsky's own brilliant theory comes in.  And, that is why he is one of the most praised economists in this post-housing crisis era.However, Minsky contradicts himself.  If Keynes ignored the dynamics of debt and its impact on bubble and crisis, how could Keynes be interpreted so as to include those concepts he so explicitly missed?  Yet, that is what Minsky is attempting to persuade the reader off.  In other words, he suggests that Keynes and him are essentially one.  If you had correctly interpreted Keynes you would have also deducted Minsky's crisis theory as part of the original Keynes foundation.  That's a very bizarre leap.It remains unclear what Minsky truly added to Irving Fisher's The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions written three decades before Minsky's first work on the topic.  Minsky is a brilliant economist on certain counts.  But, I find him a very ineffective writer (if this book is representative) especially relative to Irving Fisher.If you want to understand Minsky, instead of reading his own writings, I recommend the far clearer book written by Charles Kindleberger Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Wiley Investment Classics).  Minsky's basic concept is that the credit cycle exacerbates the business cycle because lenders lend excessively when collateral values go up and don't lend enough when they go down.  Lending and asset values (collateral) create a positive feedback loop causing both asset bubbles and crashes.  Although, this is a pretty straighforward concept (and a brilliant insight) Minsky is hardly able to articulate it clearly.  Fortunately, Kindleberger does an excellent job of it on his behalf.  It is almost like Minsky is a brilliant scientist who writes in a foreign language, he only knows.  And, Kindleberger is the brilliant translator who can make sense of it all and clearly explain it to the rest of us.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKTARDESMQZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071593012#wasThisHelpful","RCKTARDESMQZX","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This great book connects two other great books: by Claire Shipman, Katty Kay: Womenomics: Write Your Own Rules for Success and Charles Murray's Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010.  `Womenomics' explains how women have more economic power within labor markets.  Thus, women are reshaping work force practices (much more flexibility).  `Coming Apart' is about the underlying cause of the rising inequality within our society: the job marketplace becoming increasingly selective.  Murray contrasts the fate of the college educated successful citizens who live in `Belmont' vs the blue collar ones who live in `Fishtown.'  The social outcomes within the two hypothetical towns are divergent.  Belmont is increasingly educated, wealthier, competent, gainfully employed, happily married, and engaged in society.  Meanwhile, the citizens of Fishtown are increasingly marginalized, unemployed, divorced, jailed, and dependent on government hand outs.Within ""The End of Men,"" if you replace Murray's Fishtown vs Belmont by Men vs Women you get the picture (men are in nearly as dire a situation as Fishtown; meanwhile, women are increasingly thriving as the citizens of Belmont).  And, the driver is the rise of Womenomics (increasingly educated and competent women).The underlying causes of women thriving and men receding are the same ones Murray uncovered in `Coming Apart.'  It started with the slow demise of middle class unionized male blue collar manufacturing jobs since the 1960s.  The males who were earmarked for those (not college bound) have lost their footing in our modern service driven economy.  You have a slice of the former blue collar middle class that has fallen into a near permanent under class.  The shift from manufacturing to services has coincided with the rise in women's labor participation and wages.  Meanwhile, men's labor participation has declined and their wages have stagnated.  Additionally, the civil rights movement and the sexual revolution have given women control over their bodies (contraception) and more opportunities in college, grad schools, and the job marketplace.Rosin shares an abundance of data to capture the relevant trends.  I did confirm her data findings firsthand (I share them within the comment section of this review).  If you focus on the young (age 34 or younger) women dominate academia at all levels. The gender mix at public colleges is now approaching 60%/40% in favor of women.  Their percentage of college graduates now far surpasses men.  Between 1970 and 2008, the % of white men 25 - 34 year olds with college degrees rose from 20% to 26%.  But, women's percentage rose from 12% to 34%.  Women now earn 60% of the Master's degrees, including half of the JD and MD degrees.  And, they now also earn the majority of PhDs.  In the vast majority of urban centers young women now earn more than men.The disparity between men and women economic gains will widen.  Out of the 15 job sectors that will generate the most jobs over the next decade, women dominate 12 of them (all within the service sectors, including health care and education).The ""End of Men"" is an international phenomenon.  The rise and emerging economic dominance of women in academia and the job market is as prevalent in a good part of Europe and Asia.  Globally, at least in the OECD countries women have had increasing access to education and jobs at all levels.The rise of women's economic power has had destabilizing social effects.  Within the US former blue collar middle class, it has translated into high divorce rate, low marriage rate, as women have gained training and education at community colleges while men have not.  As a result, women are less inclined to marry as they do not want to feed an extra mouth (young unemployed men).  Among the college educated, trends are more positive.  Marriage rates are holding up.  But, many women now marry equals or often marry down.  In Asian countries, this trend has translated into a progressive drop in marriage rate and birth rate as women do not want to jeopardize their career opportunities for traditional household wives roles.  This is contributing to their societies aging with the associated severe fiscal implications (a declining number of workers to support a rising number of elders).Rosin refers to many interesting studies demonstrating how women are good for corporate performance.  One study confirmed that women made for better investors and risk managers because they are less overconfident, more deliberate and cautious.  Other studies demonstrated that corporations with greater women representation among senior managers had better operating performance and stock returns.  I did read some of those studies, and they were very interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXZ55WCGHR5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594488045#wasThisHelpful","RSXZ55WCGHR5H","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is among the few manuals I have read through nearly page to page.  And, I don't even plan to write a blog.  That's even though people have asked me through the years to write a blog for various reasons.  After studying this issue in much detail, I decided that starting my own blog was not a productive use of my time or that helpful for my readers.  Yet, writing a blog can be an incredibly fun, productive, and lucrative endeavors for many people.  I know off people who have succeeded doing exactly that (the author is certainly one of them).  And, I know many who have tremendously strengthen their business marketing and professional credibility by maintaining a blog or a website.I found Hussey's book hooky because I wanted to better understand the world of blogging.  The first chapter on the history of blogging gives you a great chronological overview of this rapidly changing field.  Previously, I was not perfectly clear on the difference between a blog and a website.  Now I know a blog's main purpose is for one to make daily posts; a website is a store of information about a specific subject or company etc...  By the way, Hussey teaches you both how to develop a blog and a website using Wordpress.  And, it appears for the most part between extremely simple to readily doable.  I also thought Google Blogger was the best blogging engine (it is not.  Wordpress is).  I also had no idea about web hosting, domain, and other technical aspects.  I also was unclear on the economics of blogging including its costs, and its potential income.  I was unaware of all the related information gathering tools that bloggers use that seems very useful whether you are a blogger or not (Evernote, Instapaper, Delicious, etc...).  Hussey's book educated me a whole lot on all the above.I strongly recommend this book whether you are considering starting a blog, you are already blogging, or like me if you just want to better understand what the world of blogging is about.Hussey is eminently qualified to write this book.  He is a true techie with much expertise in science, technology, and computers.  He learned HTML and developed websites going back to 1995.  He started blogging in 2004, and quickly became a very successful professional blogger.  Hussey writes in clear plain English that all of us can understand without a degree in computer programming.The book is very well organized with a coherent table of content, detailed index, and many text boxes highlighting key concepts and tricks to facilitate your blogging experience.  Hussey offers an abundance of technical tricks to get you started blogging.  He also shares plenty of qualitative advice regarding writing effectively within the blogging world.

"Be warned this book is challenging.  If you do not have a graduate degree in economics, you will probably not enjoy it.  Lance Taylor covers tens of different macroeconomics models unknown outside of professional circles.  The differences between some of those models are often obtuse.Lance Taylor's main arguments are that Keynes is enjoying a revival during our post financial crisis because his theories were right all along on several counts.  Those include that the future is truly uncertain and you can't forecast it using historical data.  This renders the valuation of stocks, derivatives, CDOs, and CDS and most everything else a dangerous and mindless exercise.  Keynes also advanced that asset prices are totally different and can diverge widely from the prices of goods and services.  Also, he refuted Say's Law by advancing that Output is determined by aggregate demand instead of aggregate supply.  Because of that an economy's equilibrium can converge towards a level of low employment.  This calls for Keynes government intervention on both the fiscal and monetary front to shore up an economy undergoing a recession.  Thus, according to Lance Taylor had we listened more closely to Keynes we would have avoided the most recent financial crisis.Yet, one can take issue with Taylor's position on several counts.First, Keynes is in no need for revenge.  Philosophically, he has dominated government policies nearly ever since the Great Depression.  Indeed, the US Government among others has steadily implemented a pretty proactive Keynesian fiscal policy.  Similarly, the Federal Reserve has (post Great Depression) for the most part conducted a rather expansive monetary policy as Keynes recommended (this is except for the Volcker years from 1979 - 1986, when he was fighting off double digit inflation).  It is only in the halls of the University of Chicago that Milton Friedman and his followers were screaming against Keynes policies.  But, the US Government never took monetarists seriously.Second, Keynes was an active proponent of very expansive monetary policies associated with very low interest rates to support investment and aggregate demand.  Yet, Lance Taylor in a contradictory fashion argues that Greenspan caused both the dot.com and the housing bubbles by maintaining excessively low rates.  If this was the case it would have been a very Keynesian monetary style.  A closer look at Greenspan's monetary policy rate setting suggests this was not the case.  During the second half of the 90s when hi-tech stocks bubbled, the Fed Funds rate was steadily at 5% or above.  Greenspan lowered the Fed Funds rate only after repeated shocks at the turn of the Millennium including Y2K, 9/11, a wrenching three year stock market crash (dot.com bubble burst), and an ongoing stagnant to recessionary economy.  The economy was barely out of a slump when in early 2004, Greenspan increased FF from 1% to 5% in just two years to deflate the housing bubble.  If Keynes had managed the Federal Reserve during the same years as Greenspan it is likely his monetary policy would have been more expansive than Greenspan's.Leveraging Keynes wisdom Taylor states that all of modern theory is nothing but a castle of cards.  It is all bunk including the Efficient Market Hypothesis, Black Scholes, and CAPM.  This is due to several reasons.  The main one is that per Keynes the future is truly uncertain and can't be modeled using any historical time series.  Additionally, all those models rely on the Normal distribution that underestimates the frequencies of rare events.  And, those models do not conform to the empirical data.However, Taylor's case is not ironclad.  First, it is unclear whether Keynes truly stated that the future was so uncertain.  Michael Emmett Brady, a PhD in economics, states in his review that Lance Taylor did not read Keynes A Treatise On Probability - Unabridged and instead relied on Paul Davidson's erroneous interpretation of this book where he defines Keynes uncertainty as truly unknowable (not captured by any statistical distribution).  But, Brady who studied ""A Treatise"" states that Keynes did not think uncertainty was unknowable (nonergodic).  And, instead he argued certain macroeconomic variables could be captured by statistical distributions (ergodic) other than the Normal distribution not to underestimate the frequency of rare events.  Paul Samuelson takes the same position as Brady.  So, there are very smart people on either side of this issue.  Is Keynes uncertainty ergodic or not?  Related to this issue, Keynes developed his concept of uncertainty in the 1920s and 1930s at the time when little data existed.  He actually created much of the intellectual architecture of modern macroeconomics data (Flow of Funds, NIPA table, chart of accounts).  So, things looked very uncertain when Keynes did not have any reliable historical time series to work with.  Today, the abundance of historical data may very well have motivated Keynes to redefine his concept of uncertainty in less ambiguous and more ergodic ways.When Taylor dismantles the whole body of modern finance, reality is more nuanced than he conveys.  Traders still rely extensively on Black Scholes or Cox-Ross-Rubinstein models to value options.  They simply increase the standard deviation when valuing options in the tail.  Others fatten the tail by layering Jump Diffusion models or Extreme Value Theory models.  In other words, modern finance theory established a foundation that is still useful and is getting refined with means to more fully capture the intrinsic risk of complex financial instruments.  Throwing the entire body of finance theory is a bit like stating Newton's law of gravity is obsolete because of Einstein's theory of relativity.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVA7QOKKF5EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674050460#wasThisHelpful","R3SVA7QOKKF5EH","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charles Ferguson advances that the senior executives of the large investment banks and mortgage companies that caused our recent financial meltdown are criminals. They should have been prosecuted and sent to jail.  Additionally, Ferguson states that the US financial service industry is dangerous to the World economy.However, Ferguson leads a Quixotic fight.  To demonstrate that Goldman Sachs did not seek the best interest of its synthetic CDO customers (by shorting the other side) is one thing.  The SEC already won this battle with a $550 million punitive settlement.  But, Ferguson feels the SEC should have prosecuted Goldman Sachs chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, frozen his assets and send him to jail. That seems like a Quixotic battle the SEC was unlikely to take or win.  Within pages 190-207, he advances all the legal grounds to attack and prosecute other leading financial executives.  The problem is that even though he does uncover really egregious acts, they are all as acrobatic as the CDO Goldman Sachs situation.  And, the top seems invariably not that tied to the ""crime"" even though they perpetrate a management culture conducive to such crimes.Eliot Spitzer tells Ferguson why he did not prosecute individuals in his conflict of interest suits against Wall Street (security analysts recommending stocks so their employers would get the underwriting business).  Spitzer explained that going after the companies was feasible, but going after the top individuals was not as it was far harder to prove guilt.  Somehow, this does not deter Ferguson.When Ferguson moves on to why the financial industry is dangerous to the World economy he is on stronger ground.  Ferguson indicates it is the case for numerous straightforward reasons.First, it relies excessively on unreliable short-term financing that shuts down the minute investors smell trouble.  See the skyrocketing increase in such s/t financing on graph of page 218.  When Lehman failed in September 2008, the short-term money markets worldwide essentially shut down.  The LIBOR-Treasury spread quickly rose to 400 basis points.  Things calmed down only once the Federal Reserve and the FDIC agreed to guarantee all liabilities from banks and money market funds.Second, the financial system is way too leveraged.  This is especially true of the shadow banking sector (hedge funds, private equity) that is not regulated.  It was also true of all the investment banks on Wall Street.  As a result, they all disappeared during the crisis except for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  It was also true of traditional regulated banks that used off balance sheet vehicles to hide their debt and increase their leverage sometimes by over 50% (Citigroup did that).Third, the financial system is way too connected (systemic risk).  A failure in the US such as Lehman Brothers can shut down the financial system through money market funds not rolling over s/t debt.  Also, all derivatives, repo, and credit counterparties to Lehman incur related losses, capital impairment, and potential insolvency.  Financial businesses are way too concentrated.  Five institutions control over 95% of all derivatives trading worldwide.  Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan control nearly half.  The top five investment banks dominate initial public offerings.  The scale, complexity, and interconnectedness of large institutions such as Citigroup and Bank of America renders them nearly unmanageable.  They seem to muddle from one crisis to another; meanwhile they threaten the global financial system as they do.When Ferguson moves on to why the financial service industry detracts from social welfare, he is also on strong grounds.  Here he refers to the investment management industry that extracts high fees and routinely fails to meet their benchmarks.  He mentions the hedge fund industry that fails to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns yet charges exorbitant 2%/20% fees.  Ferguson also scoffs at the advent of frequency trading that misallocates a huge amount of human capital and technology that would be better invested in the sciences.  If a frequent trader extracts an excess profit in a nanosecond, is society better for it?  No.  Ferguson also mentions the tax avoidance service industry whereby accountants and lawyers have devised increasingly aggressive tax evading strategies for the very rich and corporations.  Again, that's not helping society as a whole. Ferguson rails against the private equity industry that loads companies with excessive debt solely to extract ""special dividends"" until they go bankrupt, only to buy them back on the cheap after they restructured downward their debt.  The net result is a huge gain for the private equity partners and destructive disruptions for the firms (raided pension funds, layoffs, benefit cuts).  Finance has diverted a great amount of human capital that would be better redeployed in the sciences.  This is a critical waste for our society.The chapter on the conflict of interest plaguing the economic profession is the most shocking.  Ferguson uncovers how nearly the entire elite of economics professors have been corrupted by lucrative engagements with private industry to write papers, make speeches, and attend congressional hearings.  In such fashion, elite economists state influential opinions against regulations, raising taxes, and antitrust policies.  Ferguson uncovers papers who turned out genuinely embarrassing for their authors.  This includes Glenn Hubbard's article in November 2004 on ""How Capital Markets enhance economic performance...""  where Hubbard stated the capital markets have made the housing market less volatile, has distributed risk more efficiently, and has allowed for 100% home financing without defaults.  Later, he finds two papers by Frederic Mishkin and Richard Portes who declared that the Icelandic banks were very well managed, well regulated, and financially sound just months before they became insolvent and bailed out and their senior executives were prosecuted with criminal charges.  Frederic Mishkin produces another paper on how the rating agencies overcame any conflict of interest to maintain their sterling credibility in the market place.  This is just a few years after their inept ratings contributed to the financial crisis.In one of the last chapters, Ferguson addresses the cause of rising inequality in America.  He advances that the main cause is money flowing from the private sector corrupting the political and regulatory apparatus.  This is apparent in campaign financing, lobbying, revolving door between government and private sector jobs.  Along those lines he discloses interesting graphs including: 1) the financial sector rising share of GDP; and 2) rising inequality with how different top percentiles have fared.  Ferguson is almost nostalgic regarding the times when the US had a manufacturing base that could provide middle class living standards to a blue collar class.  And, he equates the drop of the labor force engaged in manufacturing with the decline of the US and rising inequality.  He feels this decline in manufacturing employment is solely due to corrupt and incompetent management related to his money based politics theory.Ferguson discourse on rising inequality is incomplete.  The causes of rising inequality are a lot more than just money based politics and corrupted financial executives overpaying themselves and lobbying for low tax rates.  There are strong external forces including globalization, technology, and the monetizing of talent in all endeavors (technology, sciences, media, entertainment, sports).  Essentially, human capital is getting monetized globally faster and on a greater scale than ever before.  From Mick Jagger to Mark Zuckeberg, their ability to make huge income and wealth has dramatically improved over the past few decades because the global marketplace has changed.  And, those forces have little to do with corrupt overly paid financial executives.  Regarding inequality, I have read recently two excellent books that explain this phenomenon better.  Those include Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010 by Charles Murray and The New Geography of Jobs by Enrico Moretti (an Italian Berkeley economist).Ferguson recommendations in the last chapter make sense.  They include: 1) Improving educational opportunity and quality; 2) Reigning in the financial sector by regulating compensation, reducing toxic economic incentives, and prosecuting financial crimes; 3) Reducing the impact of money within American politics; 4) Increasing the Estate tax; 5) Strengthening antitrust policy; and 6) Creating a universally accessible high speed broadband internet infrastructure.  Those would assist the US economic competitiveness.Ferguson makes a few errors along the way.  On page 21, he indicates that much of the US economic growth during the early to mid 2000s, besides the housing bubble, was due to the Bush Administration ""enormous"" Budget Deficits.  That's wrong.  They averaged 3.4% of GDP, reasonable by historical standards.  On page 16, Ferguson advances that the US financial crisis is responsible for the Euro Debt Crisis for years to come.  Not quite, the Euro Debt Crisis has taken a life of its own due to excessive government spending, low productivity, rigid labor markets, and resulting high unemployment in Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.  The widening economic divergence between those countries and Germany renders the Euro Zone a nearly unresolvable currency area.  On page 52, he indicates that Bush was elected due to a well-orchestrated legal campaign to avoid a Florida recount and hand the decision to the Supreme Court.  But, they were two recounts that Bush won.  The issue was whether to go for a third one.  On page 227, he states that the banks received $250 billion in TARP funds as a bail out and complaints that the Government did not ask anything in return.  That's not accurate.  The Government attached stringeant restrictions on compensation, bonuses, disclosure, lending practices with the TARP funds.  Additionally, the banks repaid all the $250 billion in TARP funds plus $20 billion associated with warrants and preferred stocks held by the Government.  On page 55, he blames Greenspan for cutting interest rates too much between 2000 and 2003 and fueling the housing bubble.  That's questionable.  Greenspan implemented an expansive fiscal policy to shore up an economy subject to repeated shocks including: the aftermath of Y2K, 9/11, and the Dot.com bubble. From the third quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2003 the economy was either in a recession or experiencing subpar growth.  Soon after he leaned heavily against the housing bubble.  In mid 2004 he increased the Fed Funds rate from 1 percentage points to nearly 5 percentage points by early 2006.  Even with 20/20 hindsight, his fiscal policy management appears reasonable.  On page 127, Ferguson writes about Goldman Sachs being ""The Really Big Short.""  But, Ferguson's own investigation suggests Goldman Sachs gains from CDS at around $8 billion never came close to the near $30 billion that the true Big Short (John Paulson) reaped.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF28IOH8I3S7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030795255X#wasThisHelpful","RF28IOH8I3S7R","A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PEVP36Y5A2EQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"....as I have a wonderful Gevalia/Cuisinart coffee maker. It has a timer. I have the coffee to water ratio for my favorite mug all figured out. I got this opportunity to test drive the brand new Ninja Coffee Bar (yes, the exact same brand as my AWESOME blender/food destroyer), so I jumped at the chance....Honestly, at first I felt about this coffee maker like my mom does about computers: I just want the damn thing to WORK....So, I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.... I estimated the size of my mug and how much coffee to insert (later today I WILL measure exactly how many ounces my coffee mug holds).... the water is automatically added so I have no say in that.... closed the drip door.... hit the button.... waited through the brew cycle.... annnnd.... my coffee just *beeped*....Well, its WAY too strong for me (if you can believe that), so more experimentation is needed. Not too bad for the first try, though!Here are the things I really like about this machine: * PERMANENT filter is included, which means no wasting any trees with paper filters!! * Filter holder slides off the machine easily for cleaning * Small footprint on my counter - actually takes up LESS space than my Cuisinart and does NOT drip all over! * The display is nice and bright and easy to read * Water reservoir is easy to remove/fill * The INSTRUCTIONS are wonderful - Quick Start guide (which we have hanging on our fridge) plus all kinds of info * Includes a 2-sided scoop to take the guesswork out of how much coffee to use (I missed this lovely tool this morning, obviously)Here are things that are not like my other machine, but I WILL get used to: * the brewing cycle ""pauses"" - which made me think the machine was not brewing - but the instructions clearly stated this is how the machine works, so I'm alright now * the stand for the coffee mug does NOT fit my behemoth mug - so I used the carafe instead, and it's fine * the neck of the carafe needs a very small bottle brush to clean - it's a plastic insert with a connected tube to funnel the coffee directly into the carafe to preserve both the flavor and heat - no worries, though, I will pick one up at the grocery store on the next tripI am PLEASANTLY surprised by this machine, and I most highly recommend it to anyone who wishes many options in a small footprint. It is a pricey machine (the stainless steel carafe alone could cost us an arm and a leg to replace), so if you just want normal coffee, you may not want to invest in this. Myself and companion (my barista in jeans) are VERY happy with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B1HOMFXFPSSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160R1LEK#wasThisHelpful","R3B1HOMFXFPSSQ","A3HPFC4WMB2LZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HPFC4WMB2LZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What could've been a simple erotic read gets off immediately on the wrong foot with a round of feminist preaching about the evils of Straight Pr0n and how DP scenes, etc, are degrading to women yet lesbian fisting is hot and erotic. Because nothing says 'sexy' like shoving your arm deeper than a doctor would into someone's reproductive organs... unless it's a woman doing it.  According to the male author, anyway.Plus the constantly changing POV throws you off. First you're Kelsey getting off in her first F/F experience then you're suddenly Cheryl reveling in the joys of teaching lesbian love to the newbie. Yet in typical porn fashion once the lid is off, Kelsey casts aside a lifetime of being straight and is all about girl-on-girl sex.

"***Disclaimer: I received a free copy in exchange for a review.***Coming into a series mid-way is always a gamble since you really don't know what's going on. This book doesn't let that happen; it's easily readable as a stand-alone and provides more than enough info to keep you in the loop.As a Daughter of the People, Hawthorn is cursed with immortality until she can find a man to truly love and trust (known as Surrendering Her Will), which will break the curse and render her mortal. Along comes Aaron- an illustrator she meets at a Con and has an instant connection with. Sparks and clothes fly, Aaron is clearly smitten and Hawthorn likes him too- enough that she begins to wonder if there could be more- provided he can come to terms with the whole Immortality thing. Plus there's a Prophecy involved stating that all the Daughters eventually become mortal but there's dissent amongst the ranks with those who see their immortality as a gift and are very reluctant to relinquish it. And will take any steps they deem necessary to protect it.The only real issue I had here was Hawthorn's speech patterns. I liked her a lot but characterization aside, her deliberate, clinical way of speaking often knocked me out of the romantic, sexy scenes: nothing kills the mood like a woman asking a man to 'copulate', etc. Repeatedly. It's like the poor guy was banging a Terminator. Aside from that, even though it's basically a romance novel it's also UF, so I was hoping for more action.Tempered is the kind of book that makes you want to read the rest of the series. What's better than that?","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDQMBZJB2WQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGX5Q18#wasThisHelpful","R2MDQMBZJB2WQY","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Disclaimer: I received a free copy in exchange for a review.***What does evil mean to me?That's the question Serafina constantly asks herself as she struggles with coming to terms with her literal inner demon. In a world where demons and humans live and work side by side this is also the central theme of the book and there's a lot of ground to cover with this surprisingly weighty premise. If you could choose to become something more than human yet purely evil, what would it take for you to embrace it? Alienation and disillusionment, certainly, but what could make you sacrifice your humanity, your immortal soul, knowing what fate ultimately awaited you?Speaking with a true demon, Damon- who doubles as the token love interest- gives Serafina some thoughtful insight to the nature of Evil, but then you immediately wonder why she didn't canvass any of her other paranormal associates for answers.But since the story is about Serafina's coming to terms with a decision she's already made, the worldbuilding suffers as other subjects are barely touched upon. Such as Lorenzo's true nature, which is never discussed and remains cloudy- how's he the leader of demons yet not a demon himself? How'd he become what he is? Who's in charge of Hell? And where does Heaven and its denizens fit into all of this? Wouldn't the very real existence of demons serve to strengthen the world's religions and philosophies? Hopefully this series won't devolve into stereotypical PNR/UF- all the benefits, none of the drawbacks- and there'll be answers as it develops.Though the title gives away the story and it veers off into flights of MarySue Chosen One, more than a few cliches and a rather anti-climatic ending, it's an interesting and somewhat intriguing read that leaves you curious as to what's to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVMDPW30V3T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5CMY2E#wasThisHelpful","RBVMDPW30V3T4","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It teases you with the hints of the larger world revealed in the next installments, and that's the only real drawback.

"I was just as surprised as anyone to find out that my boy had returned to the plantation (sic) by resigning with Warner Bros. after their widely publicized and extremely messy divorce so many years ago.  Guess time healed all wounds.  Didnt know what he was up to, but I trusted his judgment.  Given this albums theme of finding yourself after so much time searching for answers in the wrong places, or at the very least to continue looking, I guess it kind of makes sense.Art Official Age (AOA) is no doubt a return to form for Prince.  Its got so much old school Prince and funk going on you cant help but like it.  Really, really like it!  Problem is all the other stuff thatll keep you from loving it. All these spoken word interludes and performance art sequences tend to throw you off.  Not that this is anything new from Prince (recall Around the World in a Day), but back then it was always within the context of the songs.  These ones just seem to come out of nowhere half the time.  Other than that nagging issue, AOA is some ****.Some highlights:Art Official Age: (Artificial Cage- get it?) Not sure what to say about the title track.  With all the different things going on it almost feels like a mashup.  Its a commentary on our superficial flash-in-the-pan society- which is kinda funny given he became a superstar in the 80s when all that stuff really took hold- but its still got his unique stylings.Clouds: Frankie Beverly-style jam all about how to seduce your woman 24/7.  And when coupled with advice like Never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck/a kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect it  Every time you catch her singing in the shower/you should go and get a flower/no matter what the hour and just rub it on her back rub it on her back you cant lose.  In the middle of the jam it suddenly veers off into Performance Art Mode with a piece about him coming out of suspended animation after 45 years.Breakdown: a slow jam about the angst of being lost in life is peppered with PEW! PEW! laser sound effects.  Why, bro, why?The Gold Standard: another rock solid funky joint, but again- the weird performance art stuff at the end leaves you scratching your head.Breakfast Can Wait: oh so sexy groove, funky rhythm guitar hook, food euphemisms for sex, this one be rolling right up until he starts with the Alvin & the Chimpmunks voice while still trying to stay in the groove.  Seriously, my dude?This Could Be Us:  Oh man remember Adore from Sign o the Times?  This onell take you right back to it.  Prince in classic form- 100% baby-making music right here.Funk N Roll: basically a remix of the original track that appears on PlectrumElectrum.  Dont sleep on it; its still a fun listen.Time: for only the third time on the album, he does no wrong.  This is what Prince used to be all about, and its good to see he hasnt forgotten.Affirmation III: not so much a song as an outro about the message of always being true to yourself, no matter what.One thing struck me while listening to this.  Princes NPG/Lovesexy sound has been distilled by newer artists into whats known these days as PBR&B.  And it seems to have come full circle; so strange that now Prince sounds more like The Weeknd instead of vice versa.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L56V8H5OMQL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1LBC52#wasThisHelpful","R2L56V8H5OMQL1","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the heavy influences of His Purple Self, 3rdEyeGirl maintains their own identity.  Its more rock oriented than Id expected, and power rock at that.  Not to dismiss the power chords and rhythmic strumming Donna Grantis lays down here, but the drumming is always the key point in any band and Hannah Ford holds it down.  Add in Ida Neilsens smooth and steady basslines and its on!  Would love to see these ladies hook up with Dana Fuchs, Pat Benatar or Joan Jett.Some highlights-Wow: Prince helps the girls out by taking the lead on this one to start things off.  More of a rock ballad than anything, but not bad a way to start, either.PretzelBodyLogic: With Prince behind a song with this title, you know where its going.  You mean you didnt expect lyrics like PretzelBodyLogic and its so much fun/Dreaming of each other on each others tongue?  Really?Aint Turnin Round: speaking of Pat Benatar, this song channels her into the lyrics and vocal style.  If you didnt know better youd almost swear it was Benatar singing it.  Some serious distortion riffs going on here towards the end.PlectrumElectrum: title track is one hellafied power-chord instrumental.  All you wanna do is kick back and let the ladies do their thing.Whitecaps: The first slow jam to hit your ears.  Very laid back, almost smooth jazz style.  Lyrics remind you of Linda Ronstadt or Fleetwood Mac.  Dont dismiss it; its a nice lil set.Boy Trouble: if youre of a certain age thisll remind you of how Vanity 6 and Mary Jane Girls used to do.Stop This Train: a little something about heartbreak and missing the one you love.  Not bad; its ok.Another Love: Prince takes the lead again on this one.  I was really digging on the way the bass and drums flow together here, and the chorus hook is nice.Marz: Ramones riffing starts it off right.  Sounds like a it came straight out of the 80s new wave/punk movement.  Short but good.Funk N Roll: one of the best on the album.  If youre not already caught from the opening riff, I dont know what to tell you.  Feels a lot like a more rock-oriented version of Housequake.Glad Prince let the ladies step out into the spotlight and let them shine, because they do.  Would love to see them live.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TFNJDDHHVCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1LA38E#wasThisHelpful","R18TFNJDDHHVCF","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes ya just gotta wonder...I honestly don't know what goes on through the minds of YA authors.  A genre ripe with so much potential continues to be bloated with the most ridiculous tripe ever put to paper.  And it seems to stem from a fierce determination to put forth a concerted lack of effort.All you need for a YA novel is a girl, a boy for her to instantly fall in love with and cause her brains to leak out through her ear... and that's about it, really.  Anything resembling a passable, if not engaging plot must get overshadowed by this- the real point of the story- and everything must be skewed to serve this purpose.  This is the hive mind mentality that dominates YA books.Take this one.  I can only repeat what others have said: just when you thought there might be something to this one, there wasn't anymore.  Even suspension of disbelief can only take you so far: what the heck is a young girl doing in a prison full of men, not to mention being the only one there?  And why does she suddenly turn into a dishrag the moment she meets a boy... as in singular.  Doesn't even get to choose from a couple of them; as soon this guy shows up, you already know what's coming.  One love interest per YA character- that's the rule.Lather, rinse, republish.It got so I didn't even give a hoot about ACID or whatever the shadowy conspiracy revolving around this one girl is supposed to be.Another one bites the dust.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZU84ENA0MRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743874#wasThisHelpful","R11ZU84ENA0MRK","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Disclaimer: I was provided a free copy in exchange for a review.***This book is best described as bridging the gap to the next novel.  Eden's powers develop- in ways that even surprise her- and she discovers more about what the Council is up to in their labs.  There's also a deadly secret about the island that leads to a tragedy and forces Eden and her friends to attempt something never done before- escape the island.The first thing you'll notice about the book is that it's short- the last quarter or so taken up by a prequel novella involving a few things about the Council and the Catchers.  Shorter stories mean you have to get things going faster and it doesn't, due to lack of pacing  There's about a six-page discussion between Eden and Tom about what he knows but can't say because he's made a magical promise not to.  The word for that is 'geas', and it shouldn't take an author six pages to get to the point.  It was like a couple of 12-year olds talking about sex saying 'his thing, her thing'.  In that vein theres a couple of similar instances where the story really needs some tightening up.The rest of the novel mostly deals with Edens exploration of her powers and her relationships with other (male) characters, particularly Will and Tom.  Theres some growth there and Liddon even has a few surprises of his own for her.Its an ok read- not good, couldve been better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300S63SZK83YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5ES6FO#wasThisHelpful","R300S63SZK83YO","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Disclaimer: I was provided a free copy in exchange for a review.***Been a while since Ive read a book that was just plain fun to read.Reiki, our heroine, is a fiesty, spunky freckled just this side of buxom redhead (sic), who immediately brings to mind Merida from Disneys Brave. Shes smart enough to almost make it into the Moon Launch Program, but fate has something different in mind. Thanks to the enhancements of modern technology shes also a Cryokinetic- possessing the ability to freeze things.  A chance encounter on an already bad day lands her in the midst of a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of society- and costs her far more than she couldve imagined.Arthur Galenden is a rakish dilettante, upper crust through and through, his familys fortune lying in oil and his skills mainly in negotiation of the treacherous political waters of polite society. Seeking a diversion from just such tedium, his meeting Reiki will end up challenging everything he thought he knew about the world and himself.Reiki and Arthur have instant chemistry- and not that UF/PNR Chemistry aka Hes Sexy + Shes Sexy= Were Soulmates crud. They connect both intellectually and physically, making their mutual attraction feel and progress naturally and becomes something you can relate to.But the real fun lies in the dialogue. Beyond all the adventure, action and romance the political/social intrigues are the best thing about it. Watching Arthurs navigation of these shark-infested waters is especially entertaining and the inner monologues that accompany every characters machinations are witty, clever and anyone whos ever been in a socially awkward situation will find it hard not to identify with them. Author K. Hippolite truly has a way with words, crafting some engaging, amusing scenes that are at the heart of the story.The only real drawback here is the incomplete worldbuilding. Not that it isnt vivid, descriptive and full of imagination, it doesnt exactly explain things. The world they inhabit is a place thats not quite Earth- which is fine- but more details wouldve made it fully realized instead of being just enough to tell the tale. No sense of history is given, no idea of how things developed and it kind of makes you feel like the storys happening within a vacuum.Rocket Girls Tale is one of those thats a breath of fresh air in an over-saturated genre.

"***Disclaimer: I was provided a free copy in exchange for a review.***Coral & Bone gets points for being a nice change of pace from the PNR staples of vampire, werewolves, witches, etc. But its also the same old same old when it comes down to the plot.Synopsis: Halen knows the sparks igniting under her fingertips are dangerous. She has spent her entire life trying to quell the tingly feelings that make her destroy things, but now that she is back in Rockaway Beach, where she watched her father drown, the flames have become impossible to tame. Halen is trying to hold on, but when she is thrust into a mysterious new world, the underwater realm of Elosia, she unravels the secrets of her past and cant help but ignite. As she explores Elosia, she realizes her life has been a lie. And when those who have deceived her come to her for help, Halen must choosewalk away or unleash the magick that could destroy them all. (end)Halen knows somethings not right with her- what with her extremely acute hearing, not to mention the occasional voices and always feeling some kind of prickling, tingling fiery sensations beneath her skin.  Yet oddly enough it never occurs to her why she never takes any meds, or goes to see any doctors- just does what her mother says and stuffs earplugs into her ears to drown out the noises.  Her emotions are alway in turmoil since the death of her father in what everyone calls a drowning accident. Moving around from place to place made things even more difficult, capped off by the sudden return to Rockaway Beach- the town her father died in. Which is when things start to fall apart- or come together, depending upon your perspective.Oh, and lest we forget- our girl Halen is not only a siren (aka half-breed between human and Elosian, which isnt allowed but, hey), shes the rarest kind of siren- a Blue Moon Siren! (get it? Once in a blue moon?) And the tattoo patterns all Elosians have will show you your path in life. But what if you dont want to follow it? What happens to those who oh, right- Chosen One, Love Interest and Big Bad Villain. My fault. And theres the infodumping of entire character histories- like Tages- who has a whole lot going on with her but it all got unloaded in one scene when shes taking a shower. Dead parents, meeting Daspar, immortal hunters who feast on sirens- all while shampooing her hair. Ok.Dax, the love interest, aint all that interesting.  Halen has been seeing his face in her mind all her life- even sketching him in her unguarded moments.  Hes conflicted, contradictory, sullen, moody- a lot like a normal teenager.  Except hes also boring.  Hes just there because, well someone has to in a YA PNR novel, right?Speaking of the Big Bad, theres another Blue Moon Siren, Asair, who let the darkness of his soul guide him instead of his funky tattoos. Hes dangerous, so he got trapped in a specially made prison dimension just for him called Azkaban oh, sorry. And only another BMS can release him and destroy him.Bet you never saw that one coming, huh?Theres lots of imagery leaping off the pages: the realms away from Earth are cold, rocky, luminescent, crystalline and yes, wet. The story failed to grab me though, largely because for all the new spin on things it was still all the same by the numbers cliches. Plus there was way, way, way too much withholding of information for what seemed to be no good reason other than to drag things out and pad pages, even in the midst of everything going on Halen is largely kept in the dark. Again, because seaweed. Thats not engaging- its annoying and patently obvious.  And it makes you lose interest fast.Coral & Bone gets the nod for originality but drops the ball for taking the easy way out. 2 1/2-3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q28WEH18WUGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG0SUE6#wasThisHelpful","R3Q28WEH18WUGT","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Amazon seems to have changed the product page for this item, making my original review go AWOL, so I'm reposting it.)Dragon Age: Origins boasts one of the most enjoyable soundtracks to date. Composer Inon Zur uses lots of lower ranges- oboe, tuba, bassoon, timpani, cello, male choruses- to form the bulk of his compositions, reflecting the doom of the encroaching Blight upon the world. But he's equally adept with the higher strings, lighter percussion and female chorus also- it all works well together. Befitting a game score, the majority of the tracks are brief- often less than two minutes- but he makes the most of that short span. It should be noted that this version is a more comprehensive release containing thirty-five tracks and not the ""Collector's Edition"" which boasted all of eighteen songs, seven of which were previously unreleased.Certain themes and motifs are repeated frequently- notably the main one which ends on the familiar three note measure- often forming the foundation for several of the tracks. Take the main theme, change the instrumentation, extend the notes a little and voila- Ruins of Ostagar! You can also tell when the darkspawn are on stage- tuba and bassoon blasts always signal the arrival of the beasties.Choruses & chants are well used in the mix, making them pretty evocative at times- especially the male vocals. Like most people this was my introduction to vocalist Aubrey Ashburn, who turns in a Lisa Gerrard-like performance on the soundtrack, except that she singing actual elvish lyrics written for the game.Some highlights *potential spoilers*:Dragon Age Origins- Main title opens with Ashburn's empathetic vocalizing before switching into a Conan-esque timpani and heavy brass beat that introduces the secondary and tertiary themes before a quick vocal transition leads into the string section to bring us to the primary theme before closing out with a flourish. It's the kind of stuff that makes you want to dive right into the game!I Am The One (High Fantasy Version)- Co-written by Aubrey Ashburn, this is the previously unreleased version of the song which plays during the closing credits. More Gladiator-style vocals with Ashburn stretching her chops in some very nice harmonies blending with the strings and even a little bagpipe tossed in. Make sure you're listening with headphones on to catch the rhythm guitar underneath the strings.The Chantry's Hubris- Plays during the game's introduction sequence and is really just a mash of the various themes, cues and motifs thrown together. Though choppy and disjointed, it gives you a good idea of what to expect from other tracks.The Common Dwarf- an almost dirge-like oboe over a monotonous clanging percussion reflects the unremitting toil and bleakness of life as one of the Casteless in Orzammar.The Betrayal- the moment where everything changes. The first minute or so delivers on all levels: from the forlorn bagpipe to the noble, tragic string sweeps... if you've played DAO you know what's going down here.Leliana's Song (In Uthenara)- the traditional elven song Leliana sings in the camp. Aubrey Ashburn's signature moment on the soundtrack as well as some beautiful harp and mandolin playing.Attack On Denerim- good militaristic action piece as the darkspawn descend on the capitol city. Lots of Conan-esque drums and trombone with some male choral chants at the end.Ferelden At War- Gather you armies and march to save Denerim from the darkspawn horde! Ominous, forboding and loaded with many of the secondary cues, even as it rises into the up-tempo rousing speech outside the city it's a good way to underscore the grimness of the situation.The Deep Roads- Plays during your excursions in the dwarven realm. Deep chants, trumpet blasts and a driving bass drum beat with some strings attached- it goes well with slaying darkspawn underground.Challenge An Arch Demon- Music for your Big Boss Battle! About 30 seconds in it hits stride when the female chorus, heavy drums and bleating trumpets bring in the right blend of menace and evil for the showdown. A mid-range male chorus compliments a string ostinato for the bridge to an even more ominous chant punctuated with cymbals and drums.I Am The One (Dark Fantasy Version)- as indicated, this version focuses on lower-end arrangements- timpanis, trombones, deep chants, etc- and a slightly slower tempo. Both versions are equally entertaining.For fans of the game, your enjoyment of what's been included here will only be tempered by what's not: the Ostagar Camp music and the Love Song- two glaring omissions that defy logic as to why they're missing. Despite that gaffe, this one belongs in your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USYBXEIH2Q79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN6OG6G#wasThisHelpful","R2USYBXEIH2Q79","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heavenly Sword is a CGI animated movie based on the PS3 game from 2007.  Not owning a PS3 I havent played the game, so Im judging this movie on a stand-alone basis.Heavenly Sword is entertaining, but not too engaging. Its like someone else said: it really does feel as if the cut scenes were removed from the game and strung together with a reworked plot to make a movie. Which is not good when you havent even played the game and you get that feeling.The game's story and mythos revolves around the titular Heavenly Sword, a blade said to have been wielded by an unnamed Heavenly deity against a demonic warlord called the Raven Lord.  After the battle was won and the Raven Lord defeated, the sword was left in the mortal world, becoming the center of wars over its power. The fighting made the sword lust after the life of its users, eventually killing them after a short time.  A warrior tribe finally took charge of the sword, ending the wars and pledging to keep it safe and unused for the world's own good.  Among the tribe, a legend said that the sword's original wielder would be reborn in the year of the ""fire-horse"", and that this figure would unite the world's scattered tribes and lead the world to peace. (Synopsis via Wikipedia)***SPOILER ALERT***By all accounts the movies plot diverges greatly from the games. Key difference being that Nariko and Kai are true sisters: Master Shen was ashamed of his failure to deliver the Chosen One for his clan so he set off across the country, sexually assaulting various women to spread his seed around. And it worked: he fathered a son- Loki- whom once discovered everyone now assumes is the Chosen One. Problem is Loki took off to seek his fortune, and couldnt have picked a worse place to do so- Bohans fortress. So the girls have to set off to find their little brother and hand him the sword- smack dab in enemy HQ.***END SPOILER***The story doesnt make some things clear and leans on a few cliches. Nariko runs around challenging entire armies while barely wearing any clothing ala Red Sonja. Why she couldnt wear even some piecemeal armor is beyond me. King Bohans connection to the Raven King is never really shown until the final scene, and even then you have to think about it for a minute to realize whats happening. He also rules the kingdom from a fortress built inside a volcano riiight. More like the creators were enamored with the Fire Nations Boiling Rock Prison from Last Airbender. The steampunk elements were kinda distracting- like Kais repeating cylinder crossbow and her appearance (all she was missing was goggles), the gliders and catapults employed by Bohan heck- the gondolas they had to use just to get to his fortress! Whatever, man.The CGI and motion capture arent as smooth as youd think theyd be, but theyre decent enough. Still not a fan of all these folks with western features running around an Asian setting, either. The music doesnt play much into things, but as a soundtrack/score buff I kept an ear out for it. Wasnt bad; did the job to underscore the emotional and dramatic sense of the moment. The action is 100% video game/wuxia like youd expect- leaping, twirling, twisting, diving, ten-against-one, etc. Cant forget Flying Fox and Whiplash- the latter whom Id like to have seen more of. Foxs illusions were when I started getting annoyed: there was no reason to suspect hed had that kind of power and seemed like a complete @$$ pull.Voice acting is ok; often times it was out of sync with the characters facial movements- like good ol fashioned bad kung fu overdubbing. The actors themselves were good: Anna Torv reprises her role as Nariko, Ashleigh Ball plays Kai; Alfred Molina (whos instantly recognizable) as King Bohan replaces Andy Serkis who was unavailable and Nolan North fills multiple roles as supporting characters Master Shen, Roach and Kyo.Heavenly Swords not a bad way to spend 90 minutes- it just couldve been a lot better. And stick around for the end credits for a possible hint of things to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBOZWDGJ8MK21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTZAKNS#wasThisHelpful","RBOZWDGJ8MK21","AXOO7BPM22BDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXOO7BPM22BDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We Are Not Ourselves is not an easy book to read.  It is neither short nor enjoyable in places.  But it is real.  Its a look at life  one womans life in particular.  Eileen Leary, the main character, is one of the most contradictory characters Ive ever encountered.  At times she can be so materialistic and so focused on the idea that money and things will make her life better  that will give her the life she dreams of that I could just shake her.  There were many sections when she was so focused on the right THING (watch, table, furniture, house) that I was a bit disgusted by her.  Her acquisitiveness, her pettiness.She would have to have a talk with Brenda about the dryer sheets she always found in the machine and the empty detergent boxes she ended up throwing out herself.  These little quality-of-life infractions added up to a diminishment of her happiness on the planet.And yet  as the novel continues  her petty-mindedness is gradually and the demonstrably overshadowed by the ways in which she makes the hard choices, the examples of the numerous times she chooses love and people over things or convenience.  She seems to start to understand herself a bit better as she moves through the phases of her life.When she finally gets the house shes planned for, dreamed of  she sits in the driveway and thinks - She wanted the next phase of her life to remain forever potential and the rest of her things to stay in the truck.  She dreams more of things the way they might be than the actual things.Eileen is an incredibly strong woman.  She works and fights for what she wants, and more importantly, for those she loves.  When her husband Ed is diagnosed with Alzheimers  she deals with the diagnosis, and later, with the deterioration of the man she loves, with a strength, kindness, and patience that few people would be able to muster.  And yet  there is still that other side of her personality that never really goes away.Its the true Alzheimers, she said, with something like pride at the thought that if her husband were to be destroyed by a degenerative neurological disorder, it would be the undiluted article, the aristocrat of brain diseases.Her thoughts and feelings are incredibly forceful and intense  so much so that many times she is unable to let them out.  In one scene, her husband and son are hugging just after they all learn about Eds diagnosis.  Her son, Connell, invites her into the hug, but The idea of a group hug embarrassed her and she couldnt comply.So much of Eileen is about the external.  How one is seen in the world, what other people think, what ones possessions say about him or her.  And yet, her life turns out to be more about whats inside. She, who dreams of the perfect, idyllic life does not shy away from the most grueling of circumstances.  Without complaint and without much serious thought of giving up, she cares for her husband until long past the time when most people would have buckled.If this book was about almost any other subject  I would say the level of detail, the descriptions that seem to go on and on would be too much.  But Alzheimers  the gradual disappearance of ones memory and identity  needs this minute step-by-step depiction in order for the reader to have some level of understanding of how cruel and unremitting it is.  Eds fight to hold on and Eileens determination to be with him during every step of that fight is an remarkable story  one that the reader cannot help but admire.Even with her faults  by the end of the book  Eileen proves herself to be a rare soul.  And as I finished this, as hard as it was to read at times, I could only think of those rare souls out there either battling this disease or those loved ones watching the battle being lost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYFRLJE8D16A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB2WG#wasThisHelpful","R3DYFRLJE8D16A","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't resist the summery, cheerful design of this.  Picnics, barbecues, summer parties - it's just perfect for fun outdoor events.It's look is probably the best part - not that the rest is that bad.  It's just a little bit cheaply made (the insulation does not appear to be that sturdy and the handles are a bit stiff) - but once I read the tag - I realized that it's not maybe as versatile as I thought when I ordered it.  The small tag on the inside of the carrier says, ""After removing casserole from oven, allow to cool for 5 minutes.  We recommend that you cool to 200 degrees.""  I'm OK with the 5 minutes - it's the 200 degrees that I have a problem with.  I use these carriers (I also have a Traveling Chef carrier) to take hot dishes to places where there will probably or definitely not be a way to reheat them.  If I have to cool a dish down that far - this doesn't help.That being said - I will keep this and use it to transport dishes that need to stay cold - not hot.  (Also - I decided to keep the cardboard ring that comes on the inside of the carrier - I think that will help keep the top of the carrier from squishing down onto the food.  Helpful if the dish is only covered with foil or wrap.)This is a very cute carrier that I plan to use a great deal in the warm months whenever I have a dessert or cold dish to take to a party.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ZFV21QXAJLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQYIZPK#wasThisHelpful","R17ZFV21QXAJLS","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own and like the Brother PT-P700 PC Connectable Label Maker  but since I use it so rarely  it is stored away  and is kind of a pain to get out for just a single label.  I have to get it out, hook it up to my laptop (which is also stored away), run the program, print the label and then put it all back.  (Wow, that makes me sound lazy!)When I saw THIS labelmaker  I thought it would be perfect.  I can keep it plugged in and tucked awayand just use my iPhone to print the random single labels I need.  (Note:  I saw the sticker on the side of the printer letting me know that I could just put my phone next to it and print and I got really frustrated when it didnt work.until I slowed down and actually read the note.  Only for Android phones.  DRAT!)But the app is simple to install and after a quick install so that the printer is part of our home Wi-Fi network  now this is simply perfect.  If I need to print a label for a binder or tote  just click the app, enter the text and print.  SO easy!This is just perfect for someone (like me) who likes labels (maybe a little bit too much) but wants to be able to print them on the go and without much fuss.

"My father-in-law is a handyman - and he does everything.  Builds decks, fences, knocks down old buildings, builds pergolas and steps.  Since the weather is getting nicer - he is doing more deck/pergola work - which requires drilling into concrete for mounting braces and brackets.  Without the right equipment - that can be extremely difficult and time consuming - so I thought these would be perfect for him.He agreed - this set works very well - and the best feature is the built-in hex collar stop.

"More than anything else, I love the tone, the sense of mystery and days long past that shrouds the books of Carlos Ruiz Zafn.  The words of his stories surround the reader with sepia tones, slightly blurry while lovely images, and the faintest background music of sad, romantic waltzes.  Just opening one of his books takes me to worlds Ive never seen, worlds that may never have existed  except in the longings of his characters.The Sarri cemetery is in one of Barcelonas best-hidden corners.  If you look for it on the map, you wont find it.  If you ask locals or taxi drivers how to get there, they probably wont know, although theyve all heard about it.  And if, by chance, you try to look for it on your own, youre more likely than not to get lost.  The lucky few who know the secret of its whereabouts suspect that this old graveyard is in fact an island lost in the ocean of the past, which appears and disappears at random.In Marina  his main characters are younger than usual  but no less surrounded by mystery.  In addition to the graveyard, there are majestic yet crumbling old mansions, an opera house lost in in tragedy, and family secrets that cling and nearly choke.Even after finishing the book, I know almost nothing about the main character, Oscar, and that is completely OK.  I know his part of this gothic tale and through his eyes; I was able to escape again to a long ago and far away world that I love.This book was sad and glorious.  Beautiful and horrific.  A wonderful story and an unbelievable fairy tale.  A great book and one I was sad to put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ0JZ50EWHYJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316044717#wasThisHelpful","RQ0JZ50EWHYJ5","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just a beautiful pan.  The styling is clean and elegant - and the size is perfect for stir frying.  I was a bit worried that the handle would be too long - but with no need.I still can't believe it is cast iron.  It weighs just as much as a regular (but well made) pan - but it cooks like cast iron.  I've sauteed in it with excellent results and made a bean dish in it.  It cooks very well and very evenly.  I have not yet tried taking it from stove to oven - I am nervous that it will ruin the look of the pan.The only criticism I have is that the lid doesn't fit as securely as I would have expected.  It's not a deal breaker - but I wish there was just a bit more heft to the lid and that it was just the slightest bit bigger so that there was a better seal.Overall, though, this is a wonderful pan and I plan on using it for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32KFAD6JPYD96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN6WKZI#wasThisHelpful","R32KFAD6JPYD96","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I was deciding whether or not to splurge on wireless headphones for running - a friend lent me her set.  They were $99 - which was more than I planned to spend - but I wanted to get some sense of how much better running would be without the hassle of cords.The answer was MUCH better - but I wasn't impressed enough by the sound to spend that much money.  I looked around a bit more and found these - that seems just like the other pair - with the main difference being the better price.I'm so glad I shopped around!  Again - the sound isn't as good as my wired headphones...the bass isn't great and the sound is a bit echoey because they are jammed into your ears (the huge benefit is that they never fall out) - but for running?  They work just great.The controls are just like my iPhone headphones - super easy to use.

"I went back and forth with this book.  Was immediately interested in the bookstore, shelved it for a bit while finishing a few other books, got into it once I started it a few weeks later, forgot about it for several months, then picked it up again and then read it in two days.There is a great deal of The Killer Next Door that is standard thriller.  The cast is chock full of people with mysterious pasts, and until the identity of the killer is revealed  they are all suspects.  But starting with when that reveal happens (not at the end) and the depth that many (not all) of the characters are given  this is more than just a thriller.The story takes place in a rooming house, one managed by a very odd and sinister man, and inhabited by people who all have stories  few of them known by the other tenants.Vesta has lived at 23 Beulah Grove all her life.  Shes desperately hanging on to the only lifes shes ever known, even as she wishes for something different.  Shes been seeing her face in this carved wood frame for the whole of her life.  Still feels a sense of profound shock every time she glances into it and sees an almost-seventy-year-old woman staring back.  Where did it all go?  Did I really do so little, that Im still living here, surrounded by reminders of my parents tenancy before me  the Waterford vase, Mums collection of ceramic cottages, the framed photos of long-dead ancestors on the tallboy, The Crying Boy in the frame on the wall, Nans good teaset behind the glass of the display cabinet  with hardly a mark of my own life added on top?  Vesta is not the standard nosy old lady character.  Shes both terrified and brave, yearning for and fighting against change, and both utterly alone and the one tenant trying to create a family.There is also Collette  a woman trying to hide away in someone elses flat, Cher  scraping together some sort of life as she tries to find a way to a better future, Hossein  seeking both asylum and escape from his former life, and Thomas  the neighbor who no one really notices and who then plays the biggest role when a terrible accident changes everything.He stands awkwardly above them all, looking about for somewhere to site and radiating an air of suppressed astonishment that the chairs have run out.  I bet hes one of those people, thinks Collette, who always gives off a faint air of reproach, one of those people whos never truly happy unless hes hard done by.This book is not for the faint of heart.  Some of the descriptions of murder and the actions taken with the victims are truly sickening.  But the way the story is written and both the plot and the characters revealed make this a great read and a more than average thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10R5I46ZLNF50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143126695#wasThisHelpful","R10R5I46ZLNF50","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive read all of Jo Nesbos Harry Hole books and loved them.  I loved reading about such a flawed character  one who seems nearly fixated on destroying himself even as he tries to save others.With Blood on Snow  Nesbo has introduced another flawed character, Olav.  Hes a fixerin that he kills people for money in order to fix problems for his boss.  Olav is almost a killer with a heart of gold  the reader almost cant help but feel sorry for him and root for him even as he murders people without much emotional distress.This very short novel reads almost like a fairy tale.  Olav put me in mind of the characters of Quasimodo or even the Frankenstein monster  beings so far removed from normal human life that they seem doomed to lose even as they yearn for love.  The book is dreamlike and yet extremely violent.  Is heartbreaking as it is coldly calculating.  Nesbo toys with the readers emotions as much as he manipulates their impressions of events.Blood on Snow did not engross me the way the Harry Hole books did  but it was a short reminder of what I love about them and about the characters that Jo Nesbo brings to life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R180H0JJAL4K85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354193#wasThisHelpful","R180H0JJAL4K85","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Over the holidays, we got (2) pairs of wireless headphones.  This Turtle Beach set and a MEElectronics Air Fi Runaway set.  These two headphones are at wildly different price points  but they made for an interesting side by side comparison.The Turtle Beach headset has a charging station, which I think is fantastic.  It makes for an easy place to keep them and one less random cord at our charging area.  Connection via Bluetooth was seamless and quick.  They are also very flexible in that they twist and turn numerous ways and seem able to fit nearly any head type/shape.  The sound is good  with the foam pads completely enclosing the listeners ears  there is a true sense of surround sound and the bass is very rich.But.  These are SO heavy.  I cant imagine wearing them for more than maybe 15-20 minutes.  And I know devout gamers play for hours and hours on end  I dont know how these would be comfortable for that sort of duration.  Also  the max volume wasnt all that loud.Using the much more affordable headphones as a comparison  that set is FAR lighter and more comfortable, and the volume can be increased much louder.  But the bass and depth of sound isnt as good as the Turtle Beach set.I liked the wired option that the Turtle Beach set provided  I can see using these while working on a PC  but probably not for too long given the weight.At this price  I am not sure these headphones are worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8DRUU83E683/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNPDMEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2L8DRUU83E683","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book to be just fascinating.  The title is certainly intriguing, but it was also a rare book that actually made me change my opinions on an issue.  And THAT doesn't happen very often.  I also think in the research and writing of this book, author Jon Ronson had a similar experience.One of his first quick examples involves an LA Fitness that was shamed on social media because they wouldn't cancel the membership of a couple who had lost their jobs and couldn't afford the fees.  The result of that was that LA Fitness backed down - a story that makes one believe in the ""power of the people"".""Something of real consequence was happening.  We were at the start of a great renaissance of public shaming.  After a lull of almost 180 years (public punishments were phased out in 1837 in the United Kingdom and in 1839 in the United States), it was back in a big way.  When we deployed shame, we were utilizing an immensely powerful tool.  It was coercive, borderless, and increasing in speed and influence.  Hierarchies were being leveled out.  The silenced were getting a voice.  It was like the democratization of justice.""He may have started this project with that feeling, I don't think he believed this at the end.One famous (infamous) example of modern day public shaming was the story of Justine Sacco - a woman who had made a VERY ill-thought out tweet at the beginning of a plane flight to Africa - and whose life was ruined by the time she landed.  (To confirm how long public shaming can stay with you - I just typed ""Justine S"" into a search engine - her name was the first result and this happened in 2013.)  As Ronson researches her story, and more importantly, meets and talks to Justine, the far reaching implications of a mistaken action that took only seconds to take, becomes very clear to him.""A life had been ruined.  What was it for: just some social media drama?  I think our natural disposition as humans is to plod along until we get old and stop.  But with social media, we've created a stage for constant artificial high drama.  Every day a new person emerges as a magnificent hero or a sickening villain.  It's all very sweeping, and not the way we actually are as people.  What rush was overpowering us at times like this?  What were we getting out of it?""While most of what Ronson examines is what the shaming does to the shamee - but also - what it says about those who participate. I don't remember him using the term ""mob mentality"" - but that phenomenon is the underlying message of these case studies.The portion of the book that had the greatest impact on me was Ronson's conversations and dealing with judge Ted Poe.  (I, and maybe others know of him without knowing him - the judge that imposes sentences on people like standing on street corners holding signs about their crimes.  What I knew of him made me think he was cruel and something like a ""hanging judge"".  WOW did I have a different opnion after reading this part of the book and what we has to say about the people he dealt with.And I think (feel) the same thing happened to Ronson.  As he speaking with Judge Poe, ""Social media shamings are worse than your shamings,"" I suddenly said to Ted Poe.  He looked taken aback.  ""They are worse,"" he replied.  ""They're anonymous.""  ""Or even if they're not anonymous, it's such a pile-on they may as well be.""  ""They're brutal,"" he said.I almost hated to put this book down - but in the week since I did so, I've thought about it many, many times - and have mentioned and discussed it with most of my friends and family.  This one will stick with me for a LONG time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1662HA5JPHKGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487138#wasThisHelpful","R1662HA5JPHKGK","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't buy or wear very much makeup - so what I do use needs to work and needs to last.  This eyeshadow seems to be exactly what I need.  The color palate is well chosen, and the shadow goes on smoothly and evenly.Again, because I don't wear much makeup?  I appreciate (and use) the chart on the back that shows where to apply the different colors.  I am a bit afraid of the boldest color - but with the picture showing just where and how to put that color - I ended up looking better than I expected.  (My 14-year old daughter said it made my eyes pop!)The quality of this appears excellent.  The shadow isn't cakey and after hours of wearing it, still appears smooth and even.

"I do slideshows for my family for major events (40th birthdays, 90th birthdays, graduations) and I put all of our video clips together at the end of the year  so I was very interested in this product.  I usually use MovieMaker  but the process of pulling the photos/clips into that program is long and tedious  and it takes HOURS to finalize the project and burn it to a DVD.  Ive looked at some other programs  but many of them dont allow the user to burn to a DVD  they allow online publishing only  so this was looking to be one of my few good options.The install process took quite a while  20+ minutes.  Once that was done, though, I decided to try it out without using any sort of manual or tutorial and see how intuitive the program was.  I did pretty well.  I like the layout  that for slideshows  I can mass import photos and then rearrange them VERY easily.  The tile layout style made the photos very easy to work with.I then turned to videos  and that was a bit trickier.  Once I figured how to import the movies as clips and not full movies  I started working faster.  (Also  once I turned the view to Timeline  that helped a GREA deal.)I was curious how full featured the music editor was.  Thats a big deal for me as I always want songs or lyrics to hit in just the right place of a slideshow.  As such, I need to do quite a bit of trimming and editing.  The answer was  very full featured.  More than I will ever use/understandand yet I can do what I need to.The publishing and burning to DVD still takes quite a while  although it is faster than MovieMaker.Im looking forward to really putting this program through its paces with my end-of-the-year movie in a couple of weeks  I think this will make the process much smoother and easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AR9NT68W2PIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMQLT6C#wasThisHelpful","R2AR9NT68W2PIK","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is simply the perfect time in our nation's history to read this book.  With the recent financial collapse and the big banks only getting bigger and less responsible - a story about one of the most prolific bank robbers who IS punished for stealing while the banks get off scot-free - is just simply compelling.""People today dont remember  the government doesnt want us to remember.  The Bank of the United States just vaporized  with $100 million of peoples life savings.  Its still the biggest bank failure in the history of the world.  Thousands of people were wiped out.  And did any of those bank managers responsible go to the big house like Willie did?  No they did not.  They sat around their country clubs laughing it up.""Willie Sutton.  Willie the Actor.  An infamous quote is attributed to him: ""Why do you rob banks?""  ""Because that's where the money is.""  It's a great quote - but he denied ever saying it.  (Although he did use it for the title of one of the two books he wrote later.  In ""Where the Money Was"" - he says, ""Why did I rob banks? Because I enjoyed it. I loved it. I was more alive when I was inside a bank, robbing it, than at any other time in my life. I enjoyed everything about it so much that one or two weeks later I'd be out looking for the next job. But to me the money was the chips, that's all."")This novel about Sutton was just fascinating.  It was well written, well laid out...and was based on just an incredibly interesting character.  ""He was Henry Ford by way of John Dillinger  with dashes of Houdini and Picasso and Rasputin.  The reporters know all about Suttons stylish clothes, his impish smile, his love of good books, the glint of devilment in his bright blue eyes, so blue that the FBI once described them in bulletins as azure.  Its the rare bank robber who moves the FBI to such lyricism.""Whether the story is taking place in the present (the Christmas Day Willie was released from jail) or in his past - the action, events, characters and descriptions are just so well done.  They are vibrant without being overblown.  The reader is made aware that the events are based on Willie's memories - and that they may be colored in the process.  And the flavor of the times the story moves through - from the 1900's to the 1980's...is just so well delivered.""Baseball is everything at Eastern State.  Its the best way of killing time, of forgetting time, and one of the few sources of triumph and manly pride.  The six prison teams, therefore, play to win.  Murderers pitch inside.  Mob bosses crowd the plate.  Arsonists steal home every chance they get.  Things can get out of hand quickly.  And yet every game also features a moment or two of pure calm.  With each home run comes a tranquil pause, not just for the batter to round the bases, but for everyone else to stare in envy and wistfulness at the spot where the ball went over the wall.""When I finished this book (far too soon, it felt) - I was left feeling about the story the way one of the chroniclers of Willie's tale felt.""Reporter admits to himself, driving from the steak house back to the hotel, that its a ridiculous hope.  But no more ridiculous than being fond of a hardened, unrepentant felon.  Then he corrects himself.  He wasnt fond in the usual sense of the word.  He wouldnt want to live in a world full of Willie Suttons.  Hes simply not sure that hed want to live in a world with no Willie Suttons.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIP41WY23B3UX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087K6ZHW#wasThisHelpful","RIP41WY23B3UX","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE the idea behind this book.  Ghost ship?  Possible time travel?  Im in!The first chapter was intriguing.  Suitably spooky without being a horror story.  I was quickly sucked into the story of the ghost ship Valkyrie.  Sailors board a deserted ship found as they drift through a mysterious fog at a time when their compass is malfunctioning.  They hear (or almost hear) voices  but there are no people left on the ship.  It is completely deserted. They hear noises that make no sense.  There is ice forming around them  in August.  It was a great start to what promised to be a fascinating mystery.And then I got to Part Two  Kate.  Kate, a.k.a. Catalina Soto, is one of the most poorly written characters Ive ever read.  Shes extremely uneven.  At times she is incredibly emotional  all while the reader is being told she is tough as nails.  She finds herself extremely attractive  but in a way that a 14-year old girl might.  At one point, she actually says (out loud) - I think shes much prettier than me, when discussing another female character.Some of the sections written about Kate are just nearly painful to read.  The old Kate was back, joyfully irreverent, if only for a brief time.  Easy now, world. Im still just as screwed up.  The thought popped with such force that Kate almost jumped.But as much as I couldnt accept Kate as a remotely believable character, I kept reading so that I could find out what the Valkyrie was all about.But then  as she becomes more involved with the ship and with the mysterious billionaire who owns it  I just found myself shaking my head too often.  After another ship experiences a disaster as it nears the Valkyrie  Kate is told that it was an accidental explosion.  Kate, who is a reporter, remember, thinks:  She had seen the fire from the explosion.  She was no expert on the matter, but she was certain the fire had not been caused by a steam valve bursting.  Pretty impressive that she could tell the cause of an explosion on a ship was could only see across the water.So  I gave up.  I may go back to this as I would really like to find out what happens  but I can only take so much of Kate (or to be more accurate  the poorly written character of Kate) in one sitting.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSW0OLTICQWLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWM7HYI#wasThisHelpful","RSW0OLTICQWLE","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is extremely difficult to set up.  After opening it - I read the manual (where the diagrams aren't particularly helpful) and tried for about 30 minutes to get through the setup process.  I gave up.  I could never get the pen/receiver/iPhone app to sync up.  So I put it aside until the weekend - and then started over.  STILL confusing - still hard to set up - so I went to the manufacturer's website - which is absolutely awful.  Not a single helpful tip on there - unless you want to buy one of these pens.  THAT they make easy.So in desperation, I turned to YouTube - which I normally hate.  But - a helpful video by a user of the pen gave me the directions I needed to get the pen synced and working.  And once the setup process is over (thank goodness) - this is a great product.I often have take take meeting notes at work and then go back to desk and transcribe them.  With this pen, now it is a MUCH faster process.  With the text recognition feature - not I don't have to do the work twice.  (My handwriting is awful - so I still need to edit the text that comes up - but it still saves a great deal of time.)  And the fact that you can send straight to Evernote?  Which is one of the best programs/apps ever?  A HUGE plus.A few small things I've noticed:1) The edges of the paper you're working on seem to be tough for the receiver to pick up.  If you leave a decent margin around the sides of the paper - you'll be fine.2) You can't write on a pad of paper - only loose pages.  Probably 5 at most.3) The video I watched said the pen could store up to 10,000 pages - which seems astounding to me.  I'm nowhere near that amount - but I would say that this pen would cover most anyone's needs.4) Drawings made with this pen show up on the screen just like they are on the paper.  That is extremely cool.5) Another thing I didn't realize until I watched the video was that you can take just the pen and the receiver with you, write whatever you write, and then later one, turn on the app and import your notes.  So as long as you have the pen and it's charged - you don't need to have your computer/iPad/iPhone with you.Overall - I would give the setup process 1 star and the use process 5 stars.  If you can get this working - it's a fantastic product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZEM9L6D46HSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5WZ5R2#wasThisHelpful","RZEM9L6D46HSA","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When this lantern arrived, I was in shock.  I was sure there had to be some sort of mistake.  This looks like a lantern made for a Barbie.  Seriously - it's basically palm sized.  Small.  Lightweight and CERTAINLY compact.Once I stopped shaking my head, I put some batteries in and tried it out.And stopped laughing.  This thing, running on (3) AA batteries is REALLY bright.  Even on the lowest white setting, it easily lights a dark, windowless bathroom.  It has (2) brighter settings - and I would think that given the light it puts out - would light up a tent/camp site or large room in case of a power outage.  And really?  Only (3) AA batteries?  This would be a perfect lantern for a backpacker or for keeping in the car (which I plan to do).I am still surprised but very pleased with this.  I almost can't wait until the first time I need it...for the reaction on other peoples faces when I first pull it out - and then turn it on.This is just a great, rugged, ridiculously compact lantern.

"This is really cool!  This coil design makes for tweezing hairs in sensitive areas much less painful.  I had to turn it a few different ways before I really got the hang of it - but twisting the coils is a much easier and much less eye-watering way to remove unwanted hairs.I did some facial hair areas very quickly, without much pain or redness and my face was much smoother afterwards.  There were a few more coarse hairs that I ended up having to tackle on their own - but for a couple of minutes work - this device took care of all the rest.After the first few seconds - it is easy to get the hang of this design and I am very glad I got this.  I would definitely recommend this over regular tweezers and certainly over those stinky creams or waxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SFUUYNBGR8DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOVOFB2#wasThisHelpful","R3SFUUYNBGR8DV","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this to wear under my Thanksgiving dress. I thought it was the perfect occasion  need to look your best AND be able to eat a LOT of food comfortably.  This certainly succeeds on the comfort front  it feels snug but I am still able to eat, breathe, sit, move, etc.What I wonder about is the look of it.  I ordered a Medium  which per the size chart  should work for me.  But it feels like this is too long waisted.  The panel that should be holding in my stomach site down at my hips  and if I move it into place  I get lines and rolls.  Still  I tried this under my dress  which is medium weight jersey.  I didnt notice all that much difference  but my husband and daughter said that my waist looked noticeably slimmer.  One definite drawback, though, is the neckline.  This has a relatively high rounded neck  which I found surprising.  Mine is a wrap dress, so I think I can make it work with judicious use of a safety pin.  But a low V-neck would be better.So the jury is still out a bit  but I guess since I think it is comfortable and people looking at me think it is flattering  then this is a success.  Once I wear it for longer periods of time  well see how it holds up and how I hold up wearing it for longer hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SR883O8RR5KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UJ7YYA#wasThisHelpful","R3SR883O8RR5KX","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a combination review for both of Sara J. Henrys books featuring Troy Chance Learning to Swim and A Cold and Lonely Place.  I am combining them because after reading the second book (Cold and Lonely) this weekend  I rushed to get the first book (Learning to Swim) and read both of them within about 48 hours.  And even though Id read them out of order (and the second book heavily references the first)  it didnt matter.  I was absolutely hooked by the authors style and by her main character.Troy Chance is an extremely interesting character.  Much of the choices shes made in her life regarding her job, how far she chooses to live away from her family and her relationship status seem to make her seem like somewhat of a loner.  When she reflects upon these choices, it seems as if she thinks that to be the case as well.  But at the core of her, the reader discovers, the problem is not that she doesnt care about other people, it is that she cares too much.  Troy is incredibly empathetic without being overly emotional.  She connects with the people she meets and the people she encounters in these two books in a way that I found very compelling.  She makes their lives, their problems her own  and has a very difficult time when it comes time to break away.Several times in each book, Troy finds she has information that she can choose to give to a person whom it will greatly impact.  She wrestles with the choices, and with the results.  Sometimes letting the truth out lets people heal, and sometimes it makes things worse.  And you couldnt really know which, until you did it, and sometimes only later.I almost couldnt put these books down.  Not only was I drawn to this interesting main character and to the plots of the books  author Sara J. Henrys writing style just washed over me.  Her prose is clean, uncluttered and yet is still descriptive enough to pull the reader into the places and events as if they were actually there.These were well-written, interesting and at times suspenseful novels that I enjoyed a great deal.

"Our other toaster JUST started to go out on us - so I chose this as the replacement.  Starting out - my one complaint about this toaster was that the cord is not retractable.  (To be fair - the description never said that it was - I just feel that should almost be standard.  We keep our toaster in a cupboard and to not have a cord mess is a HUGE benefit.)Other than that - this is a good toaster.  I LOVE that the control is digital.  That is a major upgrade from what we had.  We have four toast eaters in the house - all with differing opinions on toast done-ness - and now that we each know our perfect #?  There is no fighting about turning the dial back.  This is a great feature.I also like the ""Bagel"" and ""Defrost"" options.  We eat frozen waffles and without that - it's tricky to get them completely done.  (Note:  Read the directions that say to press the ""Defrost"" or ""Bagel"" option AFTER depressing the lever.)The toaster starts up with a default level of ""4"" - which was perfect for my toast.  My kids like it lighter - the use ""3"".  Because this is chrome - I wonder how the surface will stand up to finger marks - but since we keep it out of sight - that really isn't a factor for us.This is a good toaster so far and the digital display is by far the best feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6N2H9129T44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8XFGI2#wasThisHelpful","R1F6N2H9129T44","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am working on a slide show project and have LOTS of old picture to scan.  I chose this scanner because it was lightweight, only needed a USB plug-in and not separate power, and because we have a Canon printer that we have been happy with.All in all, the printer/scanner we have does just as good a job processing photos - if not better.This scanner was pretty easy to install (but be sure and turn it over to unlock it before you get frustrated and think it's broken) - but it doesn't scan very quickly.  Also, it makes a sort of grinding/cutting noise as it is scanning.  (Like an electric paper cutter or a label maker at it cuts the tape.)  I scanned the same picture in our Canon MX520 and in this scanner - and the picture quality is nearly identical.  (I thought the image from the printer was slightly better - my husband though the scanner image was slightly better.)At the end of the day, I would say that if you had a great deal of photos to scan and wanted to be able to move around while you do it (I tend to sit and watch TV while I scan) - this is a good scanner for you.  Again - because you can just plus it into your laptop and go.But if you already have a decent quality printer/scanner - I am not sure this is worth adding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W18YDKCUUKDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN0NUOO#wasThisHelpful","R1W18YDKCUUKDG","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed ""The Bookseller"".  I am a huge fan of books that manipulate time/present alternate realities.  In ""The Bookseller"", a woman named Katharyn/Kitty finds herself dreaming of an alternate version of her life.During the day she works with her best friend in their bookshop, goes home to her cat, and is very close to her parents.  She  enjoys the freedom of a single life.  At night, once she is asleep, she finds herself as a married woman named Katharyn.  She is married to a handsome, kind man named Lars, she lives in a custom home, has children and doesn't work outside the home.  There is much of this dream life that she loves - Lars seems wonderful and their life together seems picture perfect.  But the more dreams she has, the more she experiences of this alternate world, the more she learns that nothing is perfect.  No life is perfect.Her lives are similar enough that there is a great deal of intersection.  She lives in the same town, at about the same time (the two versions are about 6 months apart).  But in each - there are differences.  She's made different choices, different life-changing events have or have not happened - and she finds herself struggling to keep a hold of what is real - what her true life looks like and what she really wants.I usually make notes and mark quotes as I read a book.  But this one was so engrossing and I was so eager to find out what happened next that I read it in two days with nary a note.This is not only a book that gives Katharyn the chance to see ""what if"" - it also gets to the heart of how life changes us.  How the events that occur, or don't occur, in our lives shape us and guide our choices.  ""The Bookseller"" also takes a look at the person we are at our core.  Who we truly are, regardless of circumstance, and how we deal with what lives we have.This was a great book and a very enjoyable read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152I1HBKBRAY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333003#wasThisHelpful","R152I1HBKBRAY4","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Kindle covers.  I have a Kindle Fire - and 4 different covers for it.  I have a Kindle Paperwhite - and this is my second cover for that.  Of course I want the cover to protect my device - but I also want it to look nice and more importantly, feel good in my hand.  Because I use it a LOT.The cover is pretty basic as far as looks go.  It's sleek and modern - and is a bit bigger than my previous cover.  The inside elastic straps hold the Kindle firmly, and the elastic around the whole cover holds it closed when you are not reading.  (That is a feature my other cover does not have that I miss.)  Also - that strap works as a hand hold - so you can read one-handed with your right hand.  Unfortunately - there is nothing to grip if you wanted to read holding it in your left hand.The cover is relatively lightweight so that it doesn't make your Kindle too bulky.I'd say this is pretty basic as far as covers go - no cool designs or spectacular features - but it certainly does the job and does feel good even after hours of reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O5EKE0LNJIYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTI52XW#wasThisHelpful","R2O5EKE0LNJIYX","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These drills feel good to hold - the size is great for around the house projects, not too heavy, but rugged enough to feel confident they can stand on their own.The drill is powerful enough to handle the wood I used it on with multiple sized bits.  The light feature when you press the trigger is convenient when you're working in not so well lit places.  The impact drill is great for small projects and speeds the process of replacing a bolt/nuts.  I'm not sure if my husband will use the carrying case much, but if he needs to - it's not too bulky.The batteries snap in and out easily - and help a great deal in reducing the weight of the drill.  The one thing my husband pointed out was that the impact driver did not come with a 1/4 "" bit - so in order to use the driver - you will need to either have one of those or purchase one to use this with any of your sockets.So far - this is a nice set and very easy to use!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7AU395TWK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOVOTJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1T7AU395TWK5","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 11-year old son really liked this book.  He thought it was very entertaining - and while he was reading next to me - there were several parts that he had to read aloud to me because he thought they were so funny.His favorite character was March McQuin (the main character) - the son of a notorious cat burglar.  When March's father dies - March tries to step into his father's shoes - and tries to find the sister he never knew he had.The action moves quickly and my son stayed up late a few nights reading - so I think this book was a hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2246UYZN5YPPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545468027#wasThisHelpful","R2246UYZN5YPPU","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both my 13-year old daughter and I LOVED the first book in this series.  It ended with a huge cliffhanger  so when I saw book 2 was out  I had to get it right away.  (And read it as fast as possible so I could pass it to my daughter.)Reading it quickly wasnt a problem - I enjoyed Times Edge almost as much as the first book.  Second books in great series play a very tough role.  The novelty of the first book has worn off and expectations are probably higher.  With a book about time travel  there is also some catchup to play on the readers part  remembering what has happened in the past AND in the future.  That being said, when I read the following paragraph near the beginning, I knew I was all the way in again:""I rinse away the shampoo , and a small leaf that must have been caught in my hair slides down my leg toward the drain.  It's red, dappled with gold, and I realize that I must have carried it back from Dealey Plaza.""  Kate (like so many other time travelers) ventured back to Dallas in November of 1963  and this sentence just reminded me all over again what I love about these What If? type books.  There are so many possibilities  so many chances to imagine alternate realities.Kate has so much on her shoulders in this book.  She knows what the future holds if she is unable to accomplish her mission and prevent the deaths of half of the worlds population.  As a character, she balances that incredible knowledge and responsibility well  while also worrying about whether her boyfriend, Trey, will be able to love her again despite the fact that he doesnt remember even meeting her.At times the book is a bit of a brain twister as Kate travels to multiple times/places  and some places multiple times.  Keeping track of who did what in which timeline can be tough  but after a while  its easier to just put that aside and just flow along with the action in the book. Rysa Walker does a good job of keeping things on track  and of balancing the elements of teen romance/time travel/social commentary.This is just a very enjoyable book  one that both my daughter and I were very excited to read.  The last 50 pages or so kept me up late last night  and sure enough  theres another cliff hanger to end the book  making me that much more anxious for more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SHZGTD4JXYLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477825827#wasThisHelpful","R2SHZGTD4JXYLT","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review for this pillow depends on the size of the person.  My husband is 6' 4"" and loves this.  He's only used it for long car rides so far - but it's extremely comfortable when trying to sleep sitting up.  The fabric is plush and the memory foam holds his head up yet allows him to rest.  He thinks he'd take it for plane rides as well - but the size is pretty big for air travel - so he's not completely sure.I'm 5' 5"" and I don't like it.  I don't think I have a particularly short neck - but almost from the moment I put this on - I felt like it was almost choking me.  It keeps my head straight up and I can't find a position in which I can imagine myself sleeping or resting.  It's just too big and comes too high up on my neck - almost into my face.So I would say this is ideal for larger people and for car rides.  We'll keep ours in our car, most likely, and I think it will be officially my husband's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXOEES29POH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1XCT6G#wasThisHelpful","R3VXOEES29POH5","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He liked Space Case even better  so we are both hopeful this is the start of a series.The main character of Space Case is Dashiell  a young boy who parents were chosen to go to Moon Base Alpha  the first colony on the moon.  Its supposed to be nice and a great adventure  but it turns out not to be anything like that.Dashiell gets involved in a mystery regarding the death of Dr. Ronald Holtz.  Everyone else thinks he died as a result of an accident  but Dashiell suspects foul play.

"I debated getting this book after skimming some other reviews.  They were positive - but several mentioned that the story wouldn't make as much sense/be as meaningful without reading the other books about the main character first.I would guess that the story would be a bit richer had I known more about Charles Maddox's past - but I was able to navigate through and thoroughly enjoy ""The Pierced Heart"" as a stand alone novel.The prose is nearly hypnotic as the reader is immediately drawn into the Victorian age and into the lore of vampires.  There is a haunting feel to both the sections from Charles' viewpoint and the sections from Lucy's diary.  The two narratives mesh nicely together - and the only stumbling points were when the story is pulled from them into an omniscient point of view. The feel and the flow of the story are interrupted and would be better served without these sections.This story of darkness and light, of love and madness, of science and of experimentation was well done and I will make a point of looking for a new book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VKYNZNXLUJAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545435#wasThisHelpful","R1VKYNZNXLUJAT","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although at the beginning of the book, the main character's voice reads as far more mature than his years, this story is interesting and I was engrossed in it from the start.  The action moves quickly and the characters are interesting.  I did feel that the grief aspect (once one of the main characters dies) was glossed over.  There is a great deal of discussion about how grief is perceived and how one of the characters should feel - but this death doesn't seem to affect anyone the way it should.I already placed a pre-order for the next book in this series.

"I have another or these portable chargers and it is a life saver.  Being able to store power for when you really need it is VERY handy.  Because we use that one so often - I decided to get another.  (We have a ridiculous number of devices in our household.)I was pretty surprised at how heavy this charger is.  It has some serious heft to it - and if someone was buying this to hike or backpack with - I am not sure they would be pleased.  (We just take ours for car/plane travel - so it is not an issue for us.)That being said - it charges FAST.  We charged my husband's iPhone 5s from 10% to 95% in an hour and a half AND when we were done - the portable charger still showed full battery capacity.

"I am SHOCKED that I was able to install this and that it works.  My HP laptop is...5 years old?  And it is crazy slow.  but I just can't bring myself to buy a new one right now as this one is still serviceable - it's just frustrating.  So when I saw this product - I asked a friend of mine who is FAR more computer savvy than I if he thought I could install it - and he said yes.Even then - it sat on my shelf for a week before I was brave enough to start the process.  (Partly because it did not come with the cord  I needed to connect this drive to my computer for the cloning process and I had to buy a USB to Sata converter cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ASF5MC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon.  Also - keep in mind that this drive comes with NO instructions - and that you'll probably need another PC or tablet open so you can be reading from that as you work through the cloning and install process.Finally - I felt ready.  I tried downloading the recommended cloning software from the SanDisk site - but that did not work.  (The software was never able to recognize the drive.)  Read through another Amazon review for this drive and downloaded Macrium Reflect software.  With that - it was able to recognize the SSD drive and start cloning my hard drive.  That process took about 3 hours.  Then, I took a few deep breaths and opened my laptop, carefully removed the hard drive, removed the bracket from it, installed the SSD drive into the bracket and then into the laptop, tightened the screws, put the battery back in, plugged in the power cord, turned it on, closed my eyes and crossed my fingers.The speed is SO much better.  While it certainly doesn't seem like a brand new laptop right off the shelf - the boot up time, the time it takes to open programs is WAY better.  And as far as I can tell (so far) - everything still seems to work!  (I do have all of my data/pictures/video stored on an external drive - so that did take some of the stress off.)Anyway - so far so great.  Drawbacks are the lack of cord and lack of instructions - but if I can get to the instructions and pull of what seems like a computer miracle?  Anyone can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PC9Q4AMYEW13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8ABEIM#wasThisHelpful","R2PC9Q4AMYEW13","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something to the quality of Anna Quindlens writing that just astounds me.  Somehow, it is both incredibly delicate and undeniably powerful.  She is able to describe moments and feelings in a way that is both stunning it its beauty and its strength.Blessings is the story of several people whose lives are forever changed with the arrival one night of a baby girl.  Left on the doorstep of the mansion which is the centerpiece of a small town, this baby becomes the center of the lives of Lydia Blessing, the owner, and her caretaker, Skip.  Each is forced to reevaluate their lives as they find themselves forever changed by the life of this child.Lydia Blessing, now an old woman, finds herself changing is ways she never expected, and realizing that her life had been very different than shed previously thought.  And the child at its center, crowing and smiling and waving her arms about.  They had all made her want more than she had.  The curse of having young people about the house was that they were always so redolent of possibility.Skip, a man whose life is at a crossroads between possibility and disaster, takes in and cares for Faith.  His life changes in an instant, to something he can barely recognize, and to something he is in constant wonder about.  That was all right, too, because seeing it just reminded him that it was kind of a fluke.  Like Faith had been, a burst of something incandescent in a long stretch of grey days.This is a story of choices and consequences.  Where people are forced to reexamine who they are, who they were and who they hope to be.  How people adapt, or refuse to adapt to circumstances.  How the past has a greater impact on our current lives than we can possibly until  sometimes until it is too late.It is also a story of incredible loss.  Loss of life, of love, and of possibility.  The world continues on, whether we want it to or not  whether we accept the direction or not.  There was a weight to the emptiness of rooms in which you had once lived that was more fearsome than anything she had ever encountered in life, not because they were haunted, as she had joked with Skip Cuddy, but because they were not.  The conversations, the quarrels, the long fraught silences, the tears: they had disappeared utterly and completely.As Ive thought about this book and the best word I might use to describe it  the closest I could come was poignant.  Its not what I would choose  but the definition, affecting or moving the emotions certainly applies to this beautifully written story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247YYBO3N787B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FA64WS#wasThisHelpful","R247YYBO3N787B","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These placements are a big improvement over my old ones.  Big in style AND size.My old placemats were boring - solid olive green.  They do the job - but they didn't lend any style to our table.  These placemats are bright and dress up our table setting.  When I originally ordered these - I was unsure whether they were a daisy print or a more Asian design.  They are neither - they are more a throwback to the sixties - a slightly muted ""harvest gold meets avocado green"" type pattern.  (My husband likes them but says they make him thing of his grandma - I think they are more hip than that.)And big in size!  That is the only drawback for me.  Ours is a taller bistro-ish type kitchen table - 36"" x 54"".  Our old placemats were 12""x17"" - these are 15""x18"" - they seem to take up the entire tabletop.  I'm still getting used to that...Other reviews have mentioned that these need to be ironed (which is a task I despise) - but even our old thicker ones needed to be pulled out of the dryer wet and dried flat - so that doesn't bug me too much.Anyway - they liven up the table and brighten up the kitchen - so for now I really like these!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI5TLNCPZAR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7PBQFQ#wasThisHelpful","RRI5TLNCPZAR4","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a slightly less dark way  The Supernatural Enhancements puts me in mind of House of Leaves by Mark D. Danielewski.  That was a book of twists and turns  ones that are puzzling at the least  gravity and time bending at most.  There is an unreliable narrator (for different reasons) and all along the reader knows s/he is only being given the smallest glance through a peephole to try and catch a fleeting glimpse of what is going on.This story has all of the elements of a classic haunting.  Using letters, journal entries, book excerpts, newspaper clippings and accounts of audio and video recording  the reader learns of a mysterious house bequeathed by a distant uncle whod committed suicide.  (Or had he?)  The lore surrounding the house including a girl ghost (or was she real?).  A main character who cannot speak (or can she?). The reader is unsure who or what to believe  and doesnt know if the main character, the mysterious A, has any better ideaor if through his perspective, we are being sucked down the rabbit hole along with him.The writing, in the narrative sections, is well done.  There are a few phrases I could have done without, Crop fields dash across her irises as she feasts on the continent.  But most of the book does an excellent job building the tension, giving the reader tantalizing bits of a much larger, haunting story.This silence here was somewhat heavier, lonelier than the preceding one.  The former was an elevator silence; this one was a walking-through-the-woods-by-night silence.There is a sarcastic sense of humor at play as well that I enjoyed.  Theres no way ghosts can casually wash up in social talk.  People who just let slip a reference to the occult in the middle of a serious debate (like, I read in the Post that the global economy will relapse, and so says Saturn in Capricorn) deserve execution.  ""A often acknowledges the absurdity of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the old house  yet in doing so  doesnt let the tension sag.There is a wonder to the story as well.  A desperately wants to believe in something larger than himself, and cannot.  He mocks faith while being jealous of those who have it.  He is obsessed with his search for answers, while wanting to find something that has no explanation.  It is one of the few things in the world that trespasses on the boundaries of our comprehension, that blatantly escapes mankinds consensus of what is real, of what is possible.This is a ghost story, a story about humanity, a mystery and a love story.  All of these things  of sorts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WRIASRSQZRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMEB3K#wasThisHelpful","R33WRIASRSQZRV","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw FROM THE EDITOR OF STIEG LARSSON, author of the Millennium trilogy on the top of the description of this book  I had two very conflicting thoughts.  1) That is really cheesy.  Not the author  but the editor?  REALLY?!?  2) Wow  I think I really want to read this book.  So their cheesy marketing ploy?  Totally successful.The other thing that drew me to this book was the term Hitchcockian.  Which was a term I didnt really think applied as I read through the first few chapters of the book.  And then.  Then I got to the first twist.  And I was completely hooked.  And just when I thought it was safe to settle into the book thinking of it as just a good thriller with a twistI got to the next twist.  And then I knew I couldnt take anything for granted in this book.In Alex  the terms hero/heroine/victim/villain become very had to pin down on any one character.  Every time you think you have someone figured out  it seems like the next page reveals your mistake.The writing (translating) style is very clean  allowing the reader to fly through the book.  Its not great literature  but its not meant to be.  Its meant to be a crackling good story  plot driven but with characters that have enough depth to be legitimate.  I very much enjoyed reading this book and certainly look forward to reading the next book in the trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I4E8R64H4PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623650003#wasThisHelpful","R2I4E8R64H4PJ","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised at how small the box was and was afraid there would be a LOT of assembly.  But as my husband laid it out - the plate and the bracket were hooked together so the only assembly was to connect the arms (really more like fingers, I guess) to the plate, mount the plate to the TV and then to mount the TV to the arm.  (The template provided was VERY helpful in mounting the arm to the wall stud.)There was a level included, which was nice AND there was a level on the plate itself.  The construction felt very sturdy - which was nice given how expensive an object was going to be mounted on it.  My one concern is that because of the design of this (with the modulating arm) - the mount would only be attached to one wall stud.  That SHOULD be enough - but time will tell.  In our application, the arm was absolutely necessary as we need to mount our TV in a corner.The swivel options are good - you can move the screen in many ways to create a better viewing experience.The install process might be longer than expected (30-40 minutes) but most of that has to do with wanting things very secure and in just the right place.All in all, this appears to be a great product that does what we need it to do in a very small space.

"My husband's first shave with this was on a day where he had a pretty decent beard - it had been at least 4 days since his last shave.  He charged it fully and then set to work - and even though there was a LOT of shaving to do - he ended up with a very close, smooth shave and the shaver still had 83% percent power.  The shaver was quiet, very light to hold and very flexible - able to maneuver in and out of crevices.He used it today (2 days later) and it was still at 71% after being off the charger. The shave was very smooth again, and after accidentally cumping the ""+"" button - he found out it works even better at a faster speed.  (Although that did tell me that the speed buttons are easy to bump.)  He also tried out the trimmer - and it worked very well on his sideburns.As an observer (and a wife) I am not thrilled with the size of the cleaning base.  I think it's really big - providing even more clutter on our bathroom counter.  He didn't even notices the size - being so thrilled with the self-cleaning aspect of the shaver.So far - this shaver is a huge hit.

"As a grill for ONE person - this is a good product.  The plates are nonstick and flexible enough to accommodate a thick chicken breast, burger patty or sandwich.  They don't burn the food and provide for an even consistency.  We did grilled turkey and cheese - and the cheese was very evenly melty.  It seems kind of cheaply made?  But I know people who've owned these in the past and they seem to last. It heats up fast and is easy to clean (though please note - the plates do not come off - you just need to clean them with a wet soapy cloth.)But.  This product says this is a grill for 4.  I do not see ANY way you can heat up food for 4.  Again, we did grilled sandwiches - and we fit 1 - maybe 1 1/2 sandwiches on there.  I can see maybe 2 chicken breasts fitting - if they were on the smaller side - but there is NO WAY you could cook food for 4 on this.  It's WY too small for that.I think this is a perfect grill for a single person, or for a quick lunch - but this is not the size grill for a family.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MK89C61WJA6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP3ZPVK#wasThisHelpful","R3MK89C61WJA6F","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The texture of this tablecloth makes it look and seem fancier than it really is (based on price).  It looks very elegant  yet the fabric seems far more practical and better able to stand up to stains and spills.Because Id read several reviews regarding the size and shrinkage of the cloth  the first thing I did was throw it in the wash.  It did shrink  now JUST covering the 6 table I got this for.  There are maybe 2 inches of overhang left on either long side.  Its JUST acceptable enough for a dinner party tablecloth  but hopefully the shrinking is done.  I was impressed by the very few wrinkles it had after going through the washer/dryer  requiring much less ironing (which I despise).This is a very pretty, elegant and affordable tablecloth  as long as it stays long enough to actually cover the table.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4BWHGZDM04S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UES17M#wasThisHelpful","R1B4BWHGZDM04S","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book grabbed me from the first sentence.  They never found his hands.  After that  I practically inhaled this book  reading it on one day.I am a reluctant fan of unreliable/anonymous narrators. Its a tricky plot device to pull off  so when it is done well (as it is here)  it adds to the readers interest.  When not done well  those are books that make me roll my eyes.  In The Forgers  the only once named narrator is very unreliable yet the reader believes enough of what s/he is being told to be all in and to root against those who wish him harm.  This character refers to himself as a shadow man several times  adding to the intrigue. Usually endearments  none of which need to be listed here, as we are all guilt of the same maudlin sobriquets  dislodged my given name from our conversation, which was fine by me.  Shadow men never like being called by nameOur narrator is a forger.  Mostly, supposedly, reformed.  This story takes place with his legal troubles in the past  and with a different scandal, the murder of his girlfriend Meghans brother (he of the forever missing hands) just having been discovered.The reader is never really able to get an authentic sense of our protagonist.  At times  he is very bitter about not being able to create his art  and the reader is sure he will lapse back into forging inscriptions and letters by famous authors.  That he cant keep saying no to the yearnings that call him to put pen to ink.I incarcerated the word permanent because I think it is one of the most fraudulent words in the English language, and signifies an incontestable falsehood.  Another part, however, suspected the letters and that unpublished manuscript fragment were simply too good to be true  much like the idea of permanenceAt times, we are told and feel, the great love he has for Meghan  and it seems she will be enough of an incentive for him to stay the path of the straight and narrow.  We do see him lie to her  but only at times that seem warranted by the increasingly disturbing circumstances that surround him.It takes a lot of truth to tell a lie.  Truth must surround the pulsing heart of any lie for it to be convincing, believable.  A pack of lives, like a house made from a pack of cards, will never remain standing.  But a gracefully designed construction built on both visible and underlying truths had every chance of passing muster, of passing the test of time.Yet his life always circles around the temptation to forge.  To improve rare books, to add to the history surrounding great authors and immortal literature.  To put his mark, in his way, on history.  And he meets another shadow man  who proves a great danger to his carefully scripted life.  We both were forgers as well as forgeries  we pretended to be real men, sophisticated, educated, entrepreneurial gentlemen, men who got away with what we set our minds to get away with. But as much as it pained me to admit it to myself, we were only the shadows of men of true substance.In this element of his character, I was constantly reminded of Humbert Humbert.  A man who considers himself far above the rest, of refined tastes and of high intelligence...who just beneath the surface is one driven by the basest of instincts.  A character the reader knows he or she should not like  but who captures the interest and refuses to let go.The main character of The Forgers is himself a forgery  and remains so after he claims to have turned his life around.  Just what details of his life turn out to be fake  are startling to say the leastand had me almost turn right back to They never found his hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280W3P9U9UBFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080212321X#wasThisHelpful","R280W3P9U9UBFQ","A2T9EHCUD7CNEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T9EHCUD7CNEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the design of this.  The little, stubby (but VERY secure) feet give it some style.  The handles are easy to grip and make me feel more secure about holding it even when working with hot pasta/pasta water.Speaking of the feet - this is an improvement over my previous colander - because the feet are just that little bit taller.  Again, especially when draining pasta - keeping the food up out of the bottom of the sink that is rapidly filling with incredibly hot water - is a great benefit.It's easy to hold, it looks nice, and it's an improvement over what we had.

"The audio quality with this is less than ideal. There is a strong ""whine"" in the audio output received by the FM radio; the most you can do is crank your phone or other audio source up as far as it will go, so that the music is, hopefully anyway, louder than the whine. Unfortunately, when the type of music you like has quiet spots in it... then you're going to hear the whine no matter what you do. This is a pretty serious problem for a device which is intended primarily to reproduce music.Other than that, it's easy to use, simple to plug in, and the display isn't too bad, although my power source jacks in my truck are far enough below my line of sight that I can't read what it says anyway.

"This is one of Laumer's classic hero /  adventure tales, told across multiple adjoining universes.

"Arrival:The packaging was amazing; Apple beats everyone hands down there, which is somewhat silly, but nonetheless, they do it. It was like unwrapping a particularly special Christmas present. :)Installation:I replaced our DSL modem's WiFi with the Apple Airport Extreme. I have to say, it was a very ""Apple experience"" in just the way they like you to think of it. Turned off the WiFi on the DSL modem, then plugged the AAE into our DSL modem / router. At that point, both my old 10.6.8 and my SO's 10.10.5 OS X across our shared office popped up an airport utility,  no download required, it was ""just there.""I quit the setup utility on 10.6.8, and we used hers as the odds are hers is more up to date, just as her OS is.The setup utility asked us 3 things; network name, airport name, and password. Once those were provided, it then set itself up as an access point on my network on the proper subnet, etc. Couldn't have been a whole lot easier. In fact, I don't see how it could have been '*any*' easier.The good:Security defaulted to WPA2 which is what you want; WPA and WEP are less robust.The beamforming antenna works well. I setup my phone (a Galaxy Note 3) with a wifi measuring application (WiFi Overview 360 Pro) and measured signal strength at the north end of our property. It was weak, but usable. That was at about 100 feet from the AAE. Then I turned WiFi off on my phone, after which I moved 180 to the front of the house where I was probably about 30 feet from the AAE, and turned WiFi back on while watching the signal strength on the graph; the graph came up, then took another significant step up, then another, then once more - four different levels of signal strength, all increasing by quite a bit. Once the signal was up, it stayed up. The whole process took about 3 to 4 seconds.I am almost certain this was the AAE ""aiming itself"" at me rather than an increasing partial average in the graphing math, because the graph responds almost instantly to changes in the orientation of the phone and does not incrementally vary after such a change.Beamforming seems to be less effective when multiple devices are in widely separated locations, but I'm not really certain of that yet. It is definitely no worse than the DSL modem was anywhere in the house or the yard; that's a 50'x100' expanse altogether.The iffy:There's a fan in the unit, which surprised me a little. It raises a vague concern about internal dust accumulation and subsequent requirement for service. That's pretty far out in the future, though, and it may be that simply applying a vacuum to the fan ports on the bottom would be sufficient. Can't determine that until it's actually dusty.The 5 GHz signal on my unit is consistently about 10 db weaker than the 2.5 GHz signal, so generally speaking, your dual-band phone or other dual-band device is going to choose the 2.5 GHz band. This hasn't caused me any issues yet, but it is kind of a shame, as the 5 GHz band is a lot less crowded and I'd prefer to be ""up there"" rather than ""down here"", if you catch my drift. Of course, if your device is 5 GHz only, then it'll do just the right thing.The bad:I have no no bad to report. I think this is a good product.The wishlist:I wish the 3-port switch offered more ports. If it had, I would have converted my DSL modem to passthrough mode  and let the AAE handle everything; but with 3, it would have left me short on physical Ethernet connections, so I didn't set it up that way. However, I don't think that a larger switch would add much functionality for most people, which is probably exactly why there isn't one. Plus you can always add a switch downstream if you want to go that route (no pun intended. Ok, kidding. Pun intended. :)My situation vs. yours:I have this running as an access point on an already established network, which means it is not functioning as a router for my entire network. So all of my observations should be taken with that in mind - if you are going to set this up as your primary network router, the AAE has to do some other things that I did not get involved with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J9PKBD934Q9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB9WCR6#wasThisHelpful","R3J9PKBD934Q9H","A3U7HS3TEX6B90","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HS3TEX6B90?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing cleared up our 8'x12'x3' (288 cf / 2150 gallon) pond completely - from ""pea soup"" to crystal clear. It took a few weeks, which was not unexpected. Once clear, the pond remained clear for the rest of the season. Cleaning the filter is easy; rotate the valve and push on the ""squeezer"" that pushes on the filtration element.

"I shave my head, so I really feel my pillow, and there's no airspace between my head and the pillow surface. This leads to a very hot sleeping experience on a conventional pillow, and it isn't particularly pleasant. Sweating, soaking wet areas requiring flipping the pillow, etc. I've been actively looking for some relief.I saw this mat and thought it would be worth a try. Here's what I found.The mat is heavy-ish and tends to stay in place. So that's a good thing. It's soft and has a pleasant feel when I lay my head directly on it. When I lay on a pillowcase with the mat inside the pillowcase, it loses a considerable amount of its effectiveness, as the pillowcase forms a thin layer of cloth insulation. So I've gone with sleeping right on it. This review relates specifically to that mode of use.When I first lay my head down, the mat is quite cool -- much cooler than a traditional pillow is when you first lay on it. I find that very pleasant. It warms slowly enough for me to go to sleep, as long as I don't read, etc., and get right to it.However, once my head has been on it for a while, the mat does warm up quite a bit, and it does *not* get rid of this heat. I have woken up several times to find it not only as warm (hot!) as a traditional pillow, but even hotter. The gel is laid out in an ""S"" topology in the mat so that large areas are isolated from other areas, and so the heat can't move sideways away from where my head is. It can't go down into the pillow below either, for the same reason heat doesn't get away when I lay my head on the pillow. From the description, this, I am guessing, is an intentional attempt to let one side cool while the other side is being used.Now, if, and it's a big if, my head was lying on one end of the mat, I can re-position to the other side, get a little relief, and get back to sleep. So in that sense, the design works. One side cools somewhat while the other side is being used.If I *wasn't* exactly at one end, however, a very large portion of the whole mat is warm -- and there's nowhere to go.The flaw with this design is that although it has the ability to warm slowly, it does not have the ability to quickly get rid of the heat that it absorbs from the head. So once it warms up... that's pretty much the end of that.I would love to find one of these that had some kind of heat dissipation mechanism worked into it so that heat that was absorbed would radiate away out the sides. A hollow pillow with a mat on top and integrated heat sinks that extend inside the hollow area, and a fan blowing air by them? Oy. But... something.Anyway, sleeping with the mat is often better than sleeping without it, only occasionally worse (it can get *really* hot if you don't manage to roll away in time), and so I continue to use it. But my feeling is that it doesn't do what it is advertised to do very well -- which is simply to *keep* the head cool, though I must emphasize that it starts out very nicely at first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSVA9RIDE1FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7TBHA8#wasThisHelpful","RRSVA9RIDE1FG","A3U7HS3TEX6B90","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HS3TEX6B90?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unfortunately, the spacing of the screw centers is not specified here. As it was a 12-terminal strip, I (blindly) bought the 12-terminal jumper connector sold by the same company that... well, looked right. Once the jumpers (slowly, oh so slowly) arrived from China, they didn't even come close to fitting. Sigh. My bad, I guess, but I wanted both to arrive ASAP. Should have waited until I could measure the terminal strip. The 12-terminal jumper does have the spacing specified, so that would have prevented the problem. But. Meh.The terminal strips are... terminal strips. No problems with too-tight screws, etc, as others report. However, the plastic is extremely brittle and you need to be very, very careful how tightly you affix this strip to whatever you're going to mount it on. I used screws  and a powered screwdriver, and with VERY little torque applied, the mounting hole shattered. Lesson learned, hand tighten and not very much, either. Hence the three stars.

"I can finally actually tell what my reef aquarium's ph is. Test strips are useless for this; I have never had any success at all with test strips.I let this run for a month, meaning power on, probe in the aquarium. Then I re-calibrated it at ph 7 and ph 10; it was within 1/10th of where it should have been at both points on the scale. Nice.Has its own power supply, a nice long cord on the probe, an large, easily read display, and an alarm - a blinking red LED and a beeper - that goes off if the ph gets too high. It's easily mounted on the wall, too. Very, very well thought out.Highly recommended.EDIT:  I've not had this running for several months. Still solidly in calibration -- took it out, tested it, didn't have to touch an adjustment, it was still spot-on. So I bought a second one for my non-reef salt tank. Opened it, calibrated it (it was very close right out of the box) and sunk it in there. All good.Also -- my reef tank is *thriving* now. Once I knew what the ph was, I was able to stabilize the ph where my tank denizens were happy, and several things happened: First, and quite notably, my hair algae problem simply went away over the course of a few weeks. I'd tried everything else you can imagine; getting the ph right was all it took in the end. Second, my tank creatures are all thriving.I aim at about 8.3 to 8.4 for my reef tank. The soft corals seem to be annoyed by about 8.2 on the low side, and 8.5 on the high side. The ph consistently tends to rise, so as soon as the meter shows 8.5, I knock it back to 8.3, and everything stays happy all the time. Takes about 3-4 days for the ph to reach 8.5 again. The little blinky ""alarm"" light makes sure I see that the tank needs attention very quickly, as I'm always walking past the tanks.In my reef tank, I keep fish, sponges, soft corals and mushrooms, tube worms, small clams, shrimp, crabs, limpets, and snails along with a large quantity of live rock.Totally, totally a must-have.

"I don't enjoy writing negative reviews. And I have to say up front that I was successful in getting these working correctly and installed. But it wasn't a smooth process, and it left me unhappy with the product. First, just for reference:The black wire the description confusingly describes as the ""main line"" is the ground connection.Red and green are, apparently interchangeably, brake and turn connections. Each one lights up half the red LEDs, so it doesn't appear to matter which one you choose.The yellow wire powers the yellow section of the unit, and the white wire powers the white section  of the unit.There are no electronics inside the assembly other than LEDs; it has no ""smarts"", so you get whatever lights get power and that's the end of it.Wiring:In the US, running lights are typically red. Not yellow. Many states have a law that requires them to be red. So check your local laws before you decide to connect just the yellow lamps up as running lights.Now, on some vehicles, such as my Chevy truck, the brake and turn signal power comes in on one line, and the vehicle manages the on and off, with on always being 12vdc and off being zero volts -- there is no intermediate voltage. If that's how your vehicle works (check with a voltmeter), then you can wire that to the red (or green) and then the running lights to the green (or red.) One to each color.In such a circumstance, you can't use the yellow LEDs alone as turn signals, because the brakes and turn signals are on the same lines going to each lamp.If your brake and turn signals come in on separate lines, then you kind of have to wire the running lights to the yellow section, the brake to the red (or green) and the turn to the green (or red.) Unless you put an active adapter between the actual light wires and this taillight. But as is, this means you don't have red running lights, and there are laws variously addressing that in some states for trailers, passenger vehicles, and haulers. Check! You can connect both the yellow and the green (or red) together to the running lamp power and then you get red and yellow running lamps; that's reasonable. You could do it the other way, and connect the yellow lamps to the brake/signal line and have them light up only on turns and when braking, not too sure that would be a great choice, but it is an available choice.Backup lights -- if you need them, connect them, simple as that. Generally not useful to the driver for trailer wiring, but it does let anyone behind the trailer know you're in reverse, so there's that.So that's how it all works. Here are the issues I encountered:The lights don't mount flush. You need a hole cut to accommodate them, or you'll be fabricating a custom mount (that's what I ended up doing.)The wires coming out of the back are far too short; trying to get them connected can be a real problem because there's no leeway at all to get the lamp away from the mount point once any of the wires are connected.The wires are far too small a wire gauge; yes, they don't have to carry much current, but they have to survive a vibrating, bouncing vehicle environment, and they need to be larger just so they can be handled and connected more easily.After installation, one of mine didn't work. At all. After undoing the mount, I took it apart.In the process of disassembly, I learned there is no weather seal, and so water is going to get into these through the hole the wires go through, which has no grommet or other anti-leak provisions. I'll come back to that.So, the problem: Inside, the ground wire had been pulled right off the circuit board (not by me), along with a good bit of the copper plating. I repaired the board with wire and solder, and attached a heftier wire for all the connections, throwing out the too-short, too light wire.An observation: All of the wires are attached to the circuit board by simply being soldered to the solder-side where there was a handy opening in the solder mask that already had some solder and one leg of an LED poking through. Which is why the wire was able to pull up the circuit trace. Normally, if a wire is soldered to a circuit board, the wire goes in from the top of the board and is soldered underneath. This way, if the wire is pulled, the stress simply pulls the copper tighter against the phenolic, and there's no problem unless the stress is so high as to break the wire itself. But not in this... design. I use that word very loosely here. :)As supplied, the five wires that come out of the lamp are encased in an outer jacket, probably to keep the insulation from being abraded by vibration. Reasonable enough. However, this isn't shrink tubing; it's just... tubing. And the way they attached the tubing to the five wires -- I am not making this up -- was to put a thin, but fairly large diameter, metal washer around the five wires and the tubing inside and then bend the washer right in half until it... sort of... clamped the tubing against the five wires. METAL washer. Which was laying RIGHT on the circuit board. RIGHT over some soldered connections. Good grief.So I took the other light back back off the trailer where I'd installed it, and yes, same thing. I got rid of the washers and the original tubing, used heat shrink tubing instead, replaced the wires themselves with heavier gauge wires, filled the hole in the back and the screw holes and lined the box edge with silicone to actually waterproof the assembly, let it cure overnight and then re-installed them. Using spade connectors to a terminal strip. Because I have a bit of a feeling I might have to change them out sooner rather than later, given the cheapness and clue-free-rigging of the internal assembly.That was my experience. I hope yours is better, or that you avoid the entire process.So. They don't cost much, but in my opinion, you don't get much. I wouldn't buy them again; and after seeing the assembly inside, I wouldn't buy anything else made by the same company, either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57L9LKC98JON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYZ4AW2#wasThisHelpful","R57L9LKC98JON","A3U7HS3TEX6B90","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HS3TEX6B90?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is really pretty good -- no funny taste, proper texture and mouth feel, ingredients don't cause it to dissolve or otherwise change consistency. All of which are problems we've encountered with other gluten-free pizza crusts.My only complaint is that this product is very much limited to making a ""small"" size pizza, suitable for one person at most. I *really* really wish they'd make a full size one crust -- I'm thinking of a traditional NY pizza here, 16"" to 18"", suitable to feed (at least) a family of four. I wrote them to tell them so; you can easily find them online as I did and I encourage you to do so if you agree you'd be interested in such a product.*** A tip for those of you who really care about NY pizza: with the right mozzarella (made from whole milk, instead of part-skim, low moisture) you'll get the traditional oil run-off, the cheese will stretch properly when you take a bite instead of coming off in chunks and sheets, and -- of course -- you get a proper pizza taste. That is THE key to NY style pizza. Without the right cheese, you CANNOT succeed. This is true even if you're mixing cheese types. Low moisture, part skim mozzarella isn't really mozzarella at all. Find the real thing and you seriously step up your game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3QCVK3PC8S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049PCCIA#wasThisHelpful","R3I3QCVK3PC8S1","A3U7HS3TEX6B90","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HS3TEX6B90?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, so good. Fit is excellent, and the large wheels roll easily. That's important to me because I have an eleven foot long desk with lots of monitors, keyboards, and a hardware working area. I'm always zipping back and forth (on a low-knap rug) to get to this or that. The original casters on my chair lasted about six months, then began breaking. If these break, you can bet I will update this review. These add a little height -- bigger wheels, but I can't rate that as a plus or minus, I think that varies by your height, and by if your chair is sufficiently adjustable. Mine is, so no problem there.I was looking for something even tougher -- steel, ball bearings, etc., but these seem to be about as heavy-duty as 11mm chair casters get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ALMMX8C7S9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEI52QI#wasThisHelpful","R31ALMMX8C7S9F","A3U7HS3TEX6B90","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HS3TEX6B90?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works well, provides consistent, repeatable readings within a very tight percentage range. It takes a moment to start up, you put a little weight on it, it'll announce itself, then a few moments later, it'll say ""it's ready"" and you can step onto it. You do need to be stable (standing as still as possible), or it won't read out the weight, and the heavier you are, the more this becomes an issue, so keep that in mind.The only down side?

"The Pi (B+) kits I purchase have eight GB cards, and by the time the OS was installed, were already down to six. Based on my previous linux experience, that's pretty tight. So I thought I'd try this, and I was not at all disappointed. In fact, the NOOBS installation on this 16 GB card was newer than the one in the particular kit I had purchased, so the update and dist-upgrade steps with apt-get were significantly faster -- less for them to do.The card came in an adaptor/carrier, presumably for use with a desktop system, but which also serves to protect the relatively tiny card that actually carries the data. It pops right out of there and plugs into the Pi B+ just fine. Very nice.The install of Raspian via NOOBS went perfectly, WiFi setup was a doddle, and I was only using 17% of the card when the update/upgrade via apt-get was all said and done. Lots of room for my various experiments and excursions into Raspian-land now! Time to install midnight commander (mc), sqlite3, and apache2 now!Not directly related to this card, but I am *so* impressed with the Raspberry Pi. I'm no linux newbie, I have a couple big linux servers, plus an 8-core Mac Pro where I spend a fair bit of time in the shell, and a big Windows machine as well. I do a lot of admin on the linux servers, running websites and various user accounts. That's what gives me the perspective to say with great certainty that the Pi, while not the fastest fella on the block, is an amazingly capable and complete system for almost no money compared to (cough) ""real"" desktops. This 16 GB card just makes it that much sweeter.This is the 3rd Pi in our home -- one controls the air and filtration in my Salt/Coral Reef tank, one sits on my lady's desk, and one on mine. I'm just waiting to see if the grandson indicates he's interested in one for himself.

"I didn't have any trouble with unevenness in the bubbles, but I did supply it with a fair amount of air. It's very bright, almost too bright for nighttime use, but it sure adds an interesting aspect to the fresh water tank.The only down side I have found is that it is too light, and wants to float up from wherever it is placed unless you weight it down or pin it with a heavy decoration. Probably needs a plastic-encased metal weight inside to be as good as it could be.Overall, a nice addition to the tank, though it does require some fooling around to get it to stay where you put it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260VEVHFFQ2QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW5OHBS#wasThisHelpful","R260VEVHFFQ2QE","A3U7HS3TEX6B90","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HS3TEX6B90?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use these to try to keep track of the Ph in my salt aquarium. The Ph range is too restricted, and the color changes are far too subtle to really determine what your actual Ph is. I don't know of a better alternative, but that doesn't make this acceptable by any means. I've tried expensive ""ph meters"", which are entirely too finicky about drying out and washing with distilled water and similar nonsense, and still require constant calibration with known Ph reference fluids even if you treat them just as you're supposed to. I've tried about every kind of test strips out there, and they all seem to use the same yellow-orange-purple scale which is utterly vague anywhere near the Ph range that a reef (coral supporting) tank needs to operate at. Also a VERY poor match with the color scales they supply to compare to! I am so frustrated. Anyone who has any tips for reliable, precise Ph readout without constant calibration, I'm all ears (eyes.) Please use the comments if you have suggestions. I'll try any product that offers hope. As it stands, all I know from using these things is that my Ph is ""somewhere"" between 7 and some higher value, what that higher value is I have no idea. ""It's some kind of purple"".

He's there to warn his brothers especially Ilya, the youngest. Those in power want all of them dead. Four of his brothers are married and living in Sea Haven. The women they are married to have power. Power that makes the farm where they live an impossible place to get into.The moment Gavriil stepped onto the property, the large farm with his brothers and the six women living on it, he'd felt the ripples of power and knew the farm was protected, not only by his brothers, who were dangerous, but by the elements.  Earth, Air, Water, Fire. He even felt spirit.Of course all the Prekenski men have power as well. Ilya, the youngest, is the most powerful and Gavriil is here to warn him that he's now on the kill on site order along with the rest of the brothers.

The rest of the girls all have their own business's to run  and Lexi feels she can't ask them to give up their business's to assist with the farm. But she needs help. She works from sunup till sundown and sometimes longer to make the farm a paying enterprise which it now is.

Cain is a religious fanatic with cult followers in many compounds.Caine made her his wife at age eight and forced sex on a child. An eight year old child who was no where near ready to have sex with an adult male.Cain treated her like a slave and eventually she escaped but he killed her entire family in retribution.Lexi went into to witness protection and Cain's compounds were raided though Cain and some of his most trusted men did escape. Now he's back.Of course he has no idea that Lexi now has a powerful protector. Gavriil Prekenski is a killer.

"Another great read by Weber. Spoiler alert for those who don't want to know what the books about.This one starts with Colonel John Mack, a veteran of the Iraq war,  in Oneida. An Oneida that survived the battle with the Chinese. The Chinese who withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. Oneida is loaded with burned out vehicles and debris but survived.John is over by the pigeon coop. Carrier Pigeons that are used as messengers.  Pigeons that have been used for thousands of years. The last time they were used with success was in both WWI and WWII. They are now being used again for the very same reasons they have always been used. Who the hell even looks at pigeons?? Practically no one.Wilbur Powell is the man who owns the pigeons and he lets John know where the pigeons can be used and where they will home to. Its info John needs so he can get messages out to those who need to see them.Oneida is practicing strict radio silence so the carrier pigeons are a godsend. A way to get messages out without having to send a runner.  A runner who stood a very good chance of getting killed before he got to his destination with his message. Carrier pigeons would get there quicker and be ignored by most people. A win, win for John and his team.John is still heartbroken that he hasn't been able to rescue his son Gregory and he's getting ready for a mission to Y-12. Reese the sniper and Jerry Fowler the weatherman from Y-12 along with an armed escort will be heading to Y-12. John is now headed for the airport and the plane that will get them all to Y-12. He asks  Moss to let his wife Diana and daughter Emma that he'll be on a trip.Reese is armed with a Barrett M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle and has an M4 hanging from a two point sling. Reese is an expert marksman and often provides overwatch on missions. He's one capable guy and one John appreciates big time.General Demsey has assured them that once the reach Y-12, Oak Ridge, soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division as well as scientist from the research facility would be there to greet them. After that is was a question of rigging the warhead to a balloon and sending it high into the atmosphere. A warhead that would send an EMP strike to the Chinese just like the one they sent to America.So begins another fine read by Weber.This one has John, Diana, Emma, Reese, Jerry Fowler the meteorologist, General Demsey, Billy Ray Bryant the pilot who turns out to be one hell of a fighter, Moss, Devon, Ray Gruber, the warhead that delivers the EMP strike, the Chines commander General Wei Liang who's based in Nashville, TN,, Americans being held in slave labor camps of which a captured Gregory and his friend Brandon are now part of, slaves who plant, tend and grow the food for the Chinese Army, slaves who are beaten and shot for any infraction, slaves who need a way out, a Col. Mack who comes up with a plan to get them out, an Army veteran named Dixon, a spy called Phoenix, guerilla warfare Col. Mack practices using horses, Diana and Emma finding a way to print leaflets to be dropped at the slave labor camp, General Brooks, a General Brooks who's more interested in looking good and stealing the thunder on all successful missions, a fact that Col. Mack could care less about, Col. Higgs and the rest of the Military staff, a raid on the labor camp, steam locomotives, UN troops, a battle royal between the US Army and the Chinese, a traitor no one would have ever suspected and Col. John Mack and his team beating the odds for life and liberty.Five Stars and then some.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXGKJK9P4CEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGF2DNK#wasThisHelpful","RUXGKJK9P4CEC","A2RBLZC3MJ5FNM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RBLZC3MJ5FNM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used Brita water filters in the past. I enjoy and appreciate the idea, but not always the design. This pitcher is no different.It takes forever to filter water because of the capacity of the filtering section. I get it. I really do. I'd rather have more filtered water and less water in the process of filtering it - until it's time to fill up the pitcher. And since I (and the rest of my family) drink a LOT of water, we have to fill it at least twice in a day.I've learned that you do NOT press on the little lever to pour water. It doesn't work the way you'd expect. Just pour. No pressing. You'll have better results.It's definitely a space saving design. It's thin, lightweight, and small.I'd like to love this pitcher, so I can get my dad to stop buying cases and cases of ridiculously expensive bottled water, but this won't be the one that makes him stop.For the price point, it's not bad, but it looks like I'll have to save a long time for a Berkey in order to have lots of available water to filter and drink in a timely fashion. Then I'll still have to use a pitcher to chill the water in the fridge.You have to prime the filter before you can use it. That's normal. Oh, and you'll get charcoal inside the pitcher.So, again, the idea is great. It has great potential. Just not a great design.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATH7LKUIEO7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8ME4#wasThisHelpful","RATH7LKUIEO7Y","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading and responding to the words in this book.The author provides entertaining, and raw, stories from multiple perspectives of people who stepped out on faith and lived stories worth telling, including ones in which their families or friends didn't want them to tell.Each chapter presents new and challenging questions for you to think about and reflect on. It took me several days to read through this book because I decided to write out all of the questions (in Word) and answer them as well. Obviously that's what the author wants you to do but I'm guessing the majority of readers will NOT do.By the time you finish the book and answer the questions you'll be questioning your past and making challenging decisions about your future, so that you, too, may enjoy a story worth telling.Great read.

"My family has been using this tissue for a few weeks now.What we like:It's soft. Not as soft as either of the Charmin tissues we recently reviewed, but it's certainly soft.It's thick. Again, not as thick as Charmin, but it's thick enough for when you need the security of thick tissue.There's a lot! This is a huge box. Each pack hold 12 rolls and there are8 packs in the box.What I don't love:12 rolls in a pack. I live in an apartment and storage is at a premium. Storing a single pack of 12 isn't easy. Under the sink and it takes up a lot of space. In the linen closet and I have the same problem.  A smaller pack would be helpful. Keep in mind that they tell you upfront that there are 12 rolls in a pack, so it's not the company's fault, just something you may want to keep in mind.If you're unable to use Charmin because it's so think that it messes with your sewer system, this is a (little) less thick, (little) less soft alternative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODGYUUAXXFPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M3LW28#wasThisHelpful","R2ODGYUUAXXFPS","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've long been a fan of wipes with the soft-sided packaging. At home I usually use the hard-sided cases, but for traveling or just being outside the home, the smaller soft-sided packages are just easier to use. They don't hold as many wipes, which makes them easier to travel with. Because they're soft-sided and smaller, they're easier to pack.These wipes are thick, absorbent, and clean well. Now that my girls are older, we don't use wipes to wipe bottoms, but they do come in handy to wipe hands and faces when soap and water and a washcloth aren't nearby. They're convenient. When I keep them in my car, I do put them inside a ziplock-type back to ensure they stay moist and don't dry out, since we don't use them quickly enough to use them before they'd go bad.I've used them to wipe up spills (fresh and old) in my vehicle, to clean my hands after a meal on the go, to clean faces after a bout of crying when a sink isn't nearby. They're good for cleaning counters, sinks, and toilets when you need a quick clean but when you don't want or need to use a spray. If you do have children you can also use them to clean the tables at the restaurant before you sit your child at the table.No complaints on quality or smell.

"I love Plant Therapy and I love this Spring Cleaning set. It wasn't spring when I purchased it, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. The 6 included essential oils are citrus burst, germ fighter, lavender, lemon, peppermint and tea tree. I was already familiar with PT's germ fighter since I purchased it individually for my family a few years back. While I'm familiar with the other oils, I haven't purchased the PT version of them before.The oils are packaged well enough to give as a gift without any additional fanfare. You don't need wrapping or tissue paper or even a gift bag if you didn't want to go through the trouble. It also comes with a list of several recipes, none of which I'd tried before. I was very excited about this.PT oils are pure and not pricey. When I was introduced to the brand I was intrigued because the review raved about the quality. I was expecting an unaffordable price that would be a splurge for me. Instead I was pleasantly surprised. It seemed as if the only purse oils being promoted were through MLM companies and their prices are jacked up so high that the average consumer would not be able to afford them. Not PT. They were the original company (in my opinion) that brought EOs to the masses.With pets and kids at home, I turn to EOs before I turn to chemical products. There are lots of recipes online which teach you how to incorporate EOs into your cleaning and health and this is a perfect set to help you get started.Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z07UJFBWWMQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQJ2D5Q#wasThisHelpful","R2Z07UJFBWWMQY","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Between myself and my daughters, extra stuff seems to just magically accumulate in my vehicle. I normally hang a plastic grocery bag on my shifter, although that's pretty lazy. Prior to that I would open the glove box, put a portion of the bag inside, then close the box so the bag was hanging out. It made for even more awkward conversation when someone was riding in my passenger seat.This bag, which I line with a plastic grocery bag, sits on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Surprisingly, it doesn't move around on the floor. When it gets full I simply discard the bag inside it and replace it with another one. Easy peasy. And my trash is no longer in my cupholder, the door pockets, or on the back seat floor. Well, there's still some on the backseat floor. That's still a work in progress. The girls are 9 and 11 in case you were wondering. Their bedrooms don't look much different than the back seat floor. Just sayin.If it gets dirty, just wipe it off or rinse it off if its that bad. It's waterproof too. I know this because my plastic grocery bag had a hole.I don't use the 2nd small bag that attaches to your vents because my vents are vertical instead of horizontal and its also a bit redundant.

"No home, auto, or office is complete without a basic first aid kit. I even carry a mini kit in my purse and laptop or backpack.The first thing you'll notice is the material of the carrying case. It feels like some kind of lightweight cardboard material as if its heavier than a brown paper bag but thinner than cardboard. The carrying handle and seams are stitched together. The material makes it pliable as opposed to stiff and a little more squeezable into tight spaces.The second thing you'll notice, which I was already aware of, is that when you purchase a first aid kit, the majority of the ""pieces"" in the 250 piece kit are assorted bandages.

The back side has the same information in Spanish.I've counted twice and I come up with 251 items (maybe the guide shouldn't count?), but 145 are bandages - and 50 of those would only cover the smallest of cuts.The expiration dates are at least 1/5 years away, which is pretty good.The carrying case has a handle, is zippered, and is sturdy.

It's EXACTLY because I was a student there a long time ago!On to the cups:They're a good size - since they're 18 ounces they will hold a full 16 ounces with a few ice cubes. I like that. I drink a lot of water, but they'll work with beer and sodas as well.They're sturdy. Although they're disposable cups, they are not flimsy. You don't have to be afraid that you'll grip them too tightly so they'll collapse and spill. Not gonna happen.They're reusable. I don't use the dishwasher so I can't comment on that, but I can wash them by hand and not a single one tore. I did not pull the one cup my oldest daughter put in the bathroom trash. Why was there a cup in the bathroom trash? I didn't even ask.They represent my favorite team - and Hefty doesn't make them for Ohio State.

Hours of experimenting. Hours of creativity.You do have to add water. My girls did it by putting a few drops in each circle. You could also dip the paintbrush in water instead. If the paint doesn't seem to glide right on, add more water. I found it easier to get the paint on the brush by running the brush near the outer edges since that's where the water seems to collect. You can mix the colors to make new ones.I wasn't sure, but it does wash off easily. I just tell my kids to wash their faces well in the shower and they come out clean.Very good product.

"This Radha tea tree oil comes in a generous 4 ounce glass bottle. Although it arrives with a screw on cap, you can easily change that out for a dropper top instead. The bottle is a gorgeous blue color.Tea tree oil is handy to use around the house especially for cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms, and laundry. I use it to scent my dryer balls. I switch the scent out with lavender and lemon. I use it in the kitchen and bathroom with both commercial and DIY cleaners to add that extra cleaning and disinfecting power. Although I've tried it in a diffuser, it's not my favorite scent, and since I have many to choose from, this one has moved towards the bottom of the list. I like it for its cleaning abilities, and I associate its smell with clean, but I'm leaning more towards peppermint, lavender, and lemon for the diffuser.The product is pure and natural and smells just like the other tea tree oil products I have and use.I'm looking forward to reusing this bottle once the product is completely used up.Disclosure: I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UICNCCYMGCLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKHKH8C#wasThisHelpful","R2UICNCCYMGCLV","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a Keurig b48 Elite brewer for occasional use. In addition to using the pods, we want to be able to brew our own tea and coffee.The reusable pod fits into the dispenser with no issues. It makes both coffee and tea quickly and easily. With the coffee you just have to measure out the right amount of pods for your preferred strength, and then REMEMBER how much you use. Once you've got that all figured out, you're good to go. With tea, you can use a prefilled tea bag or loose leaf tea. I use both. I like to make sweet tea (hot) then cook it down with ice. Then I'll add a mint leaf or two (delicious!). Soon I'll try hot cocoa but not til the weather is cooler. Rinse the pod well, and reuse.

"My daughter has an iPhone 5c and goes through charging cables quickly. Not necessarily her fault since she traveled a lot of the summer, but still. So it's nice to have extra cables for when you realized you lost another one. Plus, with school starting and the school allowing the kids to carry electronics as long as it doesn't interfere with class, having a charging cable in her backpack is super handy. Also, cables wear out.I like the length. Easier to find and easier to find a plug that you don't have to be sitting on the floor in order to both charge your phone and use it at the same time.

"I have sensitive skin and I'm not a regular makeup wearer, but I do like to look nice for special occasions. And, one of my bloggy friends sells an MLM product called Younique that costs $30. For my limited use, that price doesn't make sense for me. At $21.99 this makes better sense - as long as it works. While I can't specifically compare them, I can tell you that it works pretty well once you get the hang of it.With regular mascara, you simply prime the wand a few times inside the tube, then apply.With this, there's multiple wands and multiple steps. Apply the gel first. It's clear. You can feel it going on but you can't really see it. Next you apply the fibers. This is the weird part because it's leaving actual fibers on your lashes AND because you don't apply it all the way to the base of your lashes. That's something I'm NOT used to doing - starting halfway. Then the last step is to use the gel again to lock in the fibers. After that you're supposed to separate your lashes but I don't have an eyelash comb.I like it. It's a bit overdone for me. It doesn't look natural, but it doesn't look like you layered on 10 gobs of gook either. Make sure you have the extra time to let it all dry. Surprisingly, like I said earlier, it doesn't irritate my sensitive and allergy prone eyes, which is a huge plus. Plus, its a less expensive alternative than those other brands.It takes a little longer to dry because it's thicker - which is also the point - that your lashes look longer and thicker.Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased product review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU77RN3SXE17A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGO8XY0#wasThisHelpful","RU77RN3SXE17A","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not an espresso drinker. I'm not a cappuccino drinker. I'm not even a coffee drinker.But my dad drinks all 3. So when he asked if he could move in with us and this opportunity came along, I took a chance.It was well worth it.My observations: This machine is sturdy, looks GOEGEOUS on my counter (although its kinda big for my kitchen), and is easy to wipe down. You simply take a wet cloth and wipe down all you can see (and can't see behind the machine) (in addition to cleaning the inside every so often). I was concerned about milk spoiling. Not to worry, you simply remove the milk carafe/container and place it in the fridge. Also, it doesn't need to be full to make the frothy part, so if you don't use the machine too often, you won't waste milk by trying to keep the container full.My dad's observations: He used to own restaurants and he said his last machine cost about $13k. This doesn't come close to that cost (although it's still expensive in my opinion). He said it's a solid value for the price point, and that it has a great presentation for your home kitchen.  He said depending upon if you're familiar with how to use such a machine, that the results are pretty comparable to what you'd get in a restaurant whose main business is NOT coffee. But if you're used to multiple options from a real coffee house, this will not compare.You will have to set up and prime the machine before you start, so this is not INSTANT coffee, but once you get used to it, you'll feel like a pro and your visitors will think you're one too.He said there are more options than he ever used on his restaurant machine, but the employees may have used more than he did.  But if you have the time and inclination (and follow the detailed instructions) you can get an after dinner drink that's highly enjoyable, and truly customizable. It can be overwhelming at first, especially if this is your first introduction, since the company that sold him the machine for his restaurant provided detailed training. If you're not used to this type of machine OR if it's not something you'll use frequently (at least several times each week), it's probably not a good choice, and you should find something at a lower price point; there's no point in having a fancy, but costly, machine that you won't take the time to learn to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUYZCUAYWL05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6RBA#wasThisHelpful","RQUYZCUAYWL05","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this generator for those times when the power goes out.  Living in North Carolina, there is always a chance that a storm may come inland and knock the power out for a few days.  I dont really know much about generators, but this one became available, so I jumped at the chance to get one.If you are sitting next to it while running, its loud. You dont want to sit next to a generator for a long period of time anyways, so if you leave it outside and run an extension cord inside youll barely hear it in the house.Its about 100 lbs, so not very easy for me and my friend to move on our own, but the once the wheels were put on it moves around much easier.  It easily fit in the bed of her small pickup truck (once we were able to lift it up there.  We are not very muscular individuals) so we know wed be able to take it camping with us.It seems like it would be something that would be great to take camping, but the noise will be a bit of a deterrent to keeping it too close to the campsite (ruining the whole nature vibe), but if you really need electricity you could do a lot worse.I havent really run it much, more of just a turn it on to make sure it works kind of thing, but it seems to run well, and started right up the first time we tried.

"I've been using essential oils for almost 20 years. I believe in their benefits, although I do take OTC and prescription medications when I need to do so. But my preference is to use more natural remedies before I resort to those.I'm excited that lesser known companies are stepping up and bringing less expensive remedies to the marketplace so more people who previously could not afford to do so can enjoy the benefits of essential oils.I've been using this best Health Shield product all over the house. I use it in a spray bottle of vinegar to spray the door knobs (on both sides of the doors) weekly. It allows me to keep germs and sickness away by cleaning the surfaces we touch most often. I use it in a diffuser in the hallway and living room to help clean and clear the air as we walk through the main areas of our home. I use it in our all-purpose cleaning spray to add an extra layer of uumph while we're cleaning, especially on the kitchen table and sink, and bathroom sinks and toilets. I use it inside the toilet paper rolls because I love the scent. At work, I use jojoba oil instead of lotion and I've poured about 10 drops in the 3 ounces I have left and I simply shake it before each use. This allows me to moisturize my hands but keep them clean without resorting to chemical hand sanitizers that my co-workers are so fond of (although I keep telling them how harmful it will be as they get older and need the protection).This is the best time to start protecting your family from germs as the weather starts to turn and we head back to school. As suggested in a previous review I will put a drop on the soles of our feet each day (or night, depending upon when we shower) so that we're ready to face the germs.And it doesn't hurt that this combination of oils smells delightful and refreshing and uplifting. It's a great addition to our natural medicine chest.I like that it has the same or similar ingredients to the Young Living Thieves Oil. Although there are many recipes for thieves oil, I believe that all of the oils in this brand are beneficial for fighting germs, infections, fungus, and bacteria (Cinnamon, Clove, Eucalyptus, Lemon and Rosemary).Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R201TPBWPIJTGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR1VQB8#wasThisHelpful","R201TPBWPIJTGY","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've added it to cleaning solution when cleaning the counters and tables, to the diffuser during the evening when I'm looking for calm, and I'm trying to figure out a way to combine it with myrrh for the holiday season this year.The product comes in a 4 ounce amber bottle with a screw on lid and a dropper lid. The dropper lid makes it easy to use the exact amount you need. There's a 2 year shelf life on this product.

"This is part 1 of a 3 part skin care system.First you use the hyalauronic acid serum in the clear bottle. It helps to restore the hyaluronic acid your body used to make but slowly stopped producing as you got older. Next you use the Retinol in the blue bottle.

"I've been seeing these windshield sun shades for years, but didn't think they really worked. I mean, really? But why would so many people use them so religiously if they didn't. So I thought I'd give it a try.I live in Charlotte, NC and while it's not as hot as it was in Columbia, SC it's still really hot. I mean it was almost 100 degrees for an entire week and that was just June!I've been using this windshield sun shade for several weeks when I get to work. Normally my car is so hot when I get back in it at the end of the day. Not after using this. It's so weird but it works. My car isn't as hot and I don't have to run the air almost all the way to the freeway before it starts to cool off. Now it's starts to cool off before i even leave the parking lot. That's a different of about 3 to 5 minutes. It doesn't seem like a long time but it is when its in the 90s outside, you're leaving work, and the last think you want to do is fight traffic and the heat at the same time.The only part I hate is the size. I get that you can't make it any smaller, but it's just annoying to fold up and place in the backseat if you have people in your back seat or in the trunk every time you go to get back in the car.Disclosure: I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased product review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZW4TOB2PQDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WXNFVLU#wasThisHelpful","R2LZW4TOB2PQDD","A1Y32FBX45NCNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y32FBX45NCNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You need to scuff that off before putting on the vulcanizing fluid.  Then be sure to let it get tacky before applying the patch. Go ahead leave the clear bit of cellophane on the patch, it won't hurt anything and it helps keep the patch from peeling back off if you try to remove it before the patch is 100% adhered.Recommended, but carry a spare tube anyway, unless you like to walk, as some flats are not repairable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4JQUG2DGUL9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CO6T7K#wasThisHelpful","R4JQUG2DGUL9G","A1M2T0J45TTE64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M2T0J45TTE64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a 60's kid and remember when Nixon was forced out of office for Watergate. This movie is a trip back in time. What is amazing is both watching people of my generation in the crowds and the reactions to Nixon working the crowd. It's also interesting listening to the tapes which are played as voice over on some of the film. (With subtitles so you can understand it.)Now of course looking back, he wasn't as bad as certain other more recent presidents who got us into undeclared wars, started us on this massive debt spending etc etc.. And the bits with Daniel Ellsburg and Nixon's reaction remind me of Edward Snowdon. The film doesn't go into how a guy who campaigned on getting the USA out of Vietnam could let the war drag on for another 5 years. Nor does it cover his ""war on drugs"" which is on the tapes as being a way to disrupt the liberal left and the black leaders by arresting them on drug charges.  It also doesn't cover his creation of HMO's and part of the reason health care is still as messed up as it is now. (See Sicko [HD] which has those tape clips in it.)This film is home clips with the tapes and it's great. It's like looking at movies of your own family if you happened to have a dad who was president of the USA.I also can't get that opening song out my head either...

"I had the previous STI Shimano 105 shifter and it broke. So rather than look for a used or older but new in the box I opted to replace the right shifter (back derailer) through my local bike shop.First off the design changed in the routing of the brake cable that hasn't been a problem, the shift cable on the other hand eats the cables. I'm replacing it every 1.5k miles. Although I do a lot of shifting, it's the design of these shifters that is the problem. When you thread the cable through the housing you have to be super careful not to kink the cable and there is this tiny bit of plastic that covers the shifting mechanism that you need to remove to get at the entrance for threading. This plastic bit is fragile, while I haven't broken it yet, it's time is surely short. It's just a terrible design, should have had a screw to hold it in place vs the snap tabs.Lastly without the cable coming off to the side, the hood slides around. Yes I am a strong rider but it seems like every ride I spend some time while riding trying to drag the rubber hood back into position. It's again a stupid design. Thirdly the opening on the inside of the housing isn't covered well by the rubber hood leaving places to rub your fingers as you shift. So far I haven't pinched myself but then I wear long fingered gloves nearly year round.When this shifter breaks I won't be replacing it with this identical model.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF5OJQP0R9HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MPJJFG#wasThisHelpful","RKF5OJQP0R9HE","A1M2T0J45TTE64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M2T0J45TTE64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this as a gift for someone who has an iphone and an ipod touch (version 2) It works well with both devices, but not at the same time of course! In testing I get a range of about 30ft before the sound starts to break up, so you can position each device quite a ways apart and still have it work.I am not an audiophile, in fact I'm pretty tone deaf so you'll have to take other reviewers word for the sound quality, however if I was a living in an apartment and wanted a compact setup to play music you'd be hard pressed to find a more compact setup and quality package than an ipod and this speaker. (Or your phone) the only drawback to using the phone is that there is some power drain when playing music. The ipod seems to last about 2 hrs before the battery gave out and I have to plug the ipod in. However with the distance those two devices communicate it's no trouble to do that.Build quality does appear to be good. The case feels solid. It's heavy no doubt due to the battery and speaker magnets. The battery is replaceable but it's in a ""Boise"" special package which no doubt will be higher than an off the shelf garden variety battery, but that's life in the portable electronics world. At least you CAN replace it.I have a BBRY Z10 phone and the bluetooth connection worked well with that. (being curious I just tested it, and reset it afterwards.) The Z10 battery monitor seemed to indicate that it could pump out the music for about 5 hrs... but I didn't test that.As others have mentioned, with Apple and others changing their ports with each release of their product it's probably best to pick a speaker that uses Bluetooth or a usb-mini port (this speaker has both) And while Bluetooth standards change at least those standards are multi-industry.On volume, yep pretty loud, not ear drum shattering but plenty for inside a house, or out on the deck. You can control the volume from your bluetooth device and the speaker itself. (very handy)I suspect but have not tested this yet that with a bluetooth transmitter on my old stereo/amp/AM/FM receiver I could use that to transmit the music wirelessly to the deck. The beauty of that system is that the speaker can come in for the night and stay out of the rain vs buying/wiring outside speakers. It wouldn't be stereo unless I put two transmitters in... but hey it's the deck who is really paying attention to that?Pro:CompactWorks with my bluetooth devicesReplaceable batteryCharger folds flat, (the prongs fold into the unit)Seemed to reconnect to the same device after powering both off without having to do the full setup. (not fully tested though, and it is easy to connect devices.)Con:Custom battery package.charger is not a usb design, so you can't use your phone charger to charge the speaker. (seems dumb, but hey maybe phone chargers don't put out enough Amps.)Need to buy a second item, the nylon case if you want to transport it. I suppose they could have included it but if you didn't take it away from your home you wouldn't really need that.Recommended: buy. especially vs those docking station speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWH1W7GUQUKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5Q75RC#wasThisHelpful","R2MWH1W7GUQUKQ","A1M2T0J45TTE64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M2T0J45TTE64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These darts are the best for a home made blow gun. Use normal 1/2""x10ft water PVC pipe (it's white and cost around three smaker-os.) cut the pipe into thirds, file the edges smooth and use these darts with a good set of lungs for the most accurate, farthest flying least expensive, longest lasting Nerf gun.

"I bought this to return the disks shot at me by my fellow office mates using Nerf Vortex Proton Blasters (a single shot nerf gun). I like that it's easy to reload the clip, that you can buy extra clips (although I wanted to buy the big 40 disk clip which comes with a nerf Pyrogon... they don't sell the clip alone).Pros:Stores in my file drawer easily with the shoulder mount unclipped.Fast clip replacement.Easy reload of clipsYou can buy spare 10 shot clipsWith this reasonable amount of ammo you can keep them hopping while they search for more ammo off the floor.Medium:Range is ok, maybe 40ft max.Cons:Accuracy is poor as a flying disk has a tendency to veer off like a frisbee does.2 in 10 shots leave the barrel with a flying wobble that makes it drop within 10 feet. Unknown reason why.No slam fire, only single fire mode, ie. pump, shoot, release trigger, pump.I rate most Nerf toys against using a 1/2"" x 3ft PVC pipe and some Nerf suction darts which have a range of 60ft and I can knock a soda can off the cubical wall at 40ft within 3 shots.

"After breaking nearly every Nerf gun/toy I've ever owned I went looking for something that would be fun and hold up to abuse and lots of play time that's when I discovered PVC water pipe and Nerf darts. The PVC pipe is inexpensive, you get 10ft for about three dollars. Cut it in thirds, with a hacksaw, file the ends smooth. Now you have a blow gun that won't break unless you run over it with a car. I can shoot with precision nerf mega darts about 50ft. Some of my friends get 75, depends how good your lungs are.Also these darts work well with Barnett Bandit Toy Crossbow.

"Like other reviewers, I had trouble with the built in screen protector. It has too big a cutout for the front camera. I tried putting an iSmooth screen proctor under it, but the dual layer gave me trouble swiping the screen to get apps to iconize. So after a couple of days, I just popped the Otterbox screen protector out, leaving the iSmooth protector in place and it works better. I still suspect that there is a bug in the BBRY OS (I'm using a 10.0.9.422, and it's better than the previous release) that makes swiping not work perfectly.On the Otterbox, it's bulkier than the ""Commuter"" series, but then Otterbox doesn't offer a ""Commuter"" version for the Z-10 yet. I'd prefer a less bulky case as while I can be hard on phones, I'm trying to take good care of this one, and the bulky case actually makes it harder to use, ie get in and out of my pocket. I also hate holster holders so that's still in the drawer at home.So I'm giving this a qualified 4 stars, as it it could be better, but some of the failings are not of the Defender series, except the screen protector but of the lack of Otterbox alternatives.I got this case as part of a package deal from my phone company, along with the iSmooth screen protectors so shop around before you buy it here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UHEBA0LYS6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B70KYOO#wasThisHelpful","R34UHEBA0LYS6U","A1M2T0J45TTE64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M2T0J45TTE64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought my copy of this lens used at a minor discount from new to use as a video lens with my a33. Yes I don't own a FF camera, but I will within the lifetime of my owning this lens hence I'm only buying lens which can be used on both cameras. I also have a 50mm F1.7 Minolta lens which I like a lot but I'm shooting some videos inside and with this camera the more light the better for inside. I've also got the Sony 24-105mm F3.5-5.6 which I love for vacations. Yes it's a bit slow but low light shots, but I tend to shoot mostly outdoors stuff when on vacation and I got it used at a very good price. Yes I'd only buy Zeiss glass if I were richer but I'm not and the reviews of the 24-105.So why buy a 35mm F1.4 prime for an Aps-c camera? Well you may disagree but I like the portrait shots it gives me. And with the a33 in video mode you have no control over the aperture, the camera uses all the light and adjusts the frame speed and ISO automatically so to get decent inside video you need more glass. With the 50mm I have to stand too far back to pick up the sound.

"I just passed our Dyson DC24 Multi-Floor Compact Upright Vacuum Cleaner to our kid who moved out of the house into their own apartment. I had bought this hose to go with the DC24 and it workes ""sortof"" I say that because, yes it connects, but the extra hose on the DC24 when fully extended doesn't have much ""vacuuming"" power. It was used as when you need some extra reach, well you just need it and you take what you get. But if you regularly need more reach, I'd get one of the bigger vacuums. (We replaced the DC24 with a DC40 which I like) I did try it and this hose does fit the DC40, but it's a narrower hose, and it doesn't fit the wand part, it's ok for using the pet brush/mini turbine which is what I really wanted the extra reach for.Recommended with some minor hesitation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JPDWG1HIEPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00513SEH2#wasThisHelpful","R26JPDWG1HIEPN","A1M2T0J45TTE64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M2T0J45TTE64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought first a Bucket Boss Brand 07004 Duckwear Tool Roll and then after stuffing it full of every wrench, pliers and screwdriver in my auto tool ""box"" (and by box, I mean a literal box with no organization) I realized that now I had an unorganized tool roll replacing an unorganized box. So on the advice of other reviewers I bought this wrench roll to segregate the wrenches from the rest and I am extremely pleased. Yes it's white, and soon it will be gray from auto oil dirt etc, but the wrenches I had all fit, (6x7mm box to 1 1/4th combo) and if there is an empty slot I've left one in the job and will search for it before I need it next and can't find it or wonder what that rattle is under the hood.Recommended: It's better canvas than you can get in your average fabric store so even if you felt like making it, you'd need some industrial strength canvas to sew your own and a better sewing machine than your average home machine to handle the seams.

"This is the smallest recorder I've ever seen. The quality is top notch, with a crystal clear recording that wouldn't disappoint anyone. I'm a college student with professors that speak at 200 miles/sec, so I need to recorder my lectures to fill-up my notes as needed. I sit in very big lecture halls that can accommodate around 500 students, and I usually sit in the middle of the room. I've tried to sit anywhere in the room, front, back, sides - I was hearing the lecturer (speaking with a mic) at the same quality every single time. I use the 192kbs settings since the WAV files are ridiculously large (50 min lecture was about 600MB per a file but the quality is even better than 192kbs in which I get around 120-140MB/file).16GB is a lot of space even if you record on the highest quality (I would say around 10MB/min on the highest CD quality and 3MB/min on the second highest (192kbs).It has a clip on the back, so you can clip it to your backpack, side pocket in your shirt (yes it fits well!) and many other places. The clip is strong, so you won't lose your device. The previous generation of this device is the Sony ICDTX50 Digital Flash Voice Recorder in which the buttons were small and not comfortable to touch/press. This was fixed in the TX 650 and the buttons are big enough to not confuse anybody.About the English vs. Japanese version, yes most of the sellers here (this item isn't sold directly from Amazon, yet...) sell the product with an interface in Japanese. However, if you look closely, some sellers would indicate in the notes (if you press the ""New"" button under the description for more sellers) that they sell the item in English. I paid about $30 more and received my device with a full English interface.It's also a good idea to send a message to the seller you're trying to purchase from and ask if the device is in English. The sellers usually would say ""yes"" but confirm it by telling them to look at the package: if the package of the item is in English --> You have the English version. If it has anything in Japanese on the package, then the item is NOT in English. I've purchased mine from the seller ""NewItemExpress"" and it was shipped from Japan. I've received my item in two weeks.Hope it helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJFC2EH3PJVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUSPQIK#wasThisHelpful","RUJFC2EH3PJVC","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very good, but there is a newer version of the item:Sony ICD-TX650 High Quality IC Recorder (16GB) - BlackThe differences:1. 16GB vs. 4GB (no SD card extension in the newer model though. 16GB is plenty in my opinion for most people)2. The newer version is 3 times smaller (I'm not kidding)3. The buttons on the newer model is much better4. The newer model has NFC, which makes sound recording even better (TX50 has just low cut)5. Can turn the newer model with pressing on the record button for recording right away6. Everything else is pretty much the same. There is a 360 degrees recording option in the newer model but it's good only for people in meetings/small rooms that want to catch sounds from different people around the desk or something similar. In lecture hall or big rooms it's not good.The major downside is that the newer model comes with just Japanese language but there are sometimes sellers on Amazon that sell the English version, just look at the seller's notes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0OW5GA5VRI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BD0H1G#wasThisHelpful","RT0OW5GA5VRI4","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried to find a small recorder with a high quality mic. The RadRecorder seems to have it all since it records at 384KBPS while other recorders similar to the RadRecoder record only at 192KBPS. The difference is noticeable, but it's still a compressed file so don't expect to a CD quality (linear 44Hz).The good:1. Very small and compact2. Buttons are accessible and not many options/settings to mess with3.  Voice quality recording is goodThe Bad:1. It doesn't seem to filter background noises and most of my recordings had an annoying ""buzzz"" at the background. THis doesn't disrupt the speaker's voice, but it's not that great if you re-listen to all of your lectures at a given week.2. If you turn it off without double tapping on the recording button, it wouldn't save the recordings and everything you recorded at that session would be lost. It's the major disadvantage of this device in my opinion. It takes few seconds to save the file, doing many loading step which are really annoying. All the recorders I've used so far were saving the file before I turned off the device automatically and nothing was lost. Not with this one. I'm wondering what would happen if the battery is low - would it save the file or not, need to try that but I have a feeling it's the same...3. If you record many sessions and transfer them to your computer, let's say once a week, it doesn't show the recording date or time in the file data info. All files have the same date, February 24th, but each file has a different number to it so go guess which recording is which based on the speaker's voice. Not the best way to extract the recordings and overall a waste of time organizing it.4. Sometimes it's ""stuck"" when charging, meaning the battery indicator doesn't show that it's charging, so I had to re-connect the device to my computer and only then it would show the charge sign again. Maybe it was charging before hand, but because there is no battery indicator on the device itself unless you start recording (the main menu doesn't show you how much battery you have left, which is weird) - so the device has  pretty much non-user friendly interface. There are many options in the settings that don't even do anything and they state that in one of their tutorial videos, so the device is messed up since day one in one way or another.5. I've noticed while listening to my lectures, that every couple of minutes the audio file skips 1-2 seconds and it's noticeable by the context of the speech. I'm not sure if it's because I'm using VLC (on mac), which is pretty standard software, or the recorder is just doing it by default.Overall, it's an OK recorder, but if you have some extra cash grab something with a higher quality that can actually filter the noises around while you record. I grabbed Sony ICDTX50 Digital Flash Voice Recorder instead, and while I paid a premium price, you can't even compare the build quality, sound, and overall functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VSQSZBFK83E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R3BASK#wasThisHelpful","R1VSQSZBFK83E9","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quality is lacking in a lecture hall environment. I tried to compare between this device, RadRecorder - 20 hours of Continuous Recording, 8GB Capacity Holds 550 Hrs of Audio, MP3 Player, Records Telephone Calls, Dictaphone, Can Be Voice Activated, Speaker Playback for Review, Best Digital Voice Recorder by Techerific - FREE 2 Year Warranty, and Livescribe 2GB Echo Smartpen. Although the JVR was better than the livescribe pen, it was inferior by any parameter in terms of recording quality compared to the RadRecorder (probably due to the fact that the RadRecorder records at a higher quality). The JVR also picked all the keyboard sound while I was typing (fast) and it was really annoying.The good about the product is the fact that it is really small and simple. There is only one button to record, which is also the on-off button. You can play music or your recordings through the device without connecting it to a computer. I guess you can use it as a flash drive as well, but I didn't try that (you need the adapter since there isn't a direct connection with a USB between the device and the computer/laptop). I would advise paying a little bit more money and getting a good record that filters all the background noise unless you know you are going to record in a quiet environment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HEPE6YZYLO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZW9TT0G#wasThisHelpful","R38HEPE6YZYLO5","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I collect headphones for fun. Well, not really - I just buy and destroy them at the gym. I currently have Monster iSport Victory In-Ear Headphones, and before that I had the Monster iSport Immersion In-Ear Headphones with ControlTalk, Blue (Discontinued by Manufacturer). I have/had many others, non-bluetooth headphones, such as Klipsch R6i Black In-Ear Headphone with Patented Oval Tip (Black) ,Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear - Black (Apple iOS version), Bose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones for iOS Models, Black, and more at the same price level that you can find on Amazon. I mentioned all of these to compare the sound output of Monster iSport bluetooth later on.Let me tell you first that these headphones made me to read the manual for the first time of my life (a manual for headphones at least). I couldn't figure out how to change a song, and where the hell is the LED on/off. It appears that you change songs with the volume buttons - need to press on the ""+"" and ""-"" for about 2 seconds to change songs. I was also looking the LED on the remote control, but it appears as flickering blue LED light on the right side of the headphones (next to the logo). It's so tiny (and flickers only once in 5 sec when the device is on) that I missed it.Sound: I think they are pretty much the same as the Victory for $150 (currently). You get the same sound for $50? Pretty weird, but I think it's true. I tried to compare them right now on different song types such as R&B, Hip-Hop, Trance, Psych, Pop, Top 40 songs on Spotify - all seems to be very close or the same. I may say though that at times it felt that the bass was deeper in the Victory model, but overall they are very, very, very close. Overall great bass, OK lowes, good mids/highs.If you're an audiophile go look somewhere else - but I doubt you'll find anything for exercising that has audiophile quality of sound. If you do, please comment on this review and let me know - I would love to try it out.Comforte: Worth every penny. These are my first Bluetooth headphones, so I can't really compare to other brands. However, do you really think that a $30-50 headphones (the cheap Chinese stuff that have the most reviews here on Amazon) would have the same quality of the above? I think it wouldn't, especially if you exercise and make them wet regularly. I may be wrong, but with the above you don't just pay for the name brand like in many other headphones - Monster iSport is known for built quality and comfort and they delivered every single time. These would never fall out of your ears, unless you have really weird ear canals: running, weight lifting, hiking, you name it - not going to happen.Ease of use: Here they lack a bit. I press the ""-"" button and Spotify for some reason goes to the beginning of the song instead of playing the previous song in the list - maybe it's the program or the headphones (or maybe I'm doing it wrong), but that's a bit annoying. They pair fine, but you can hear decrease in volume/disturbance once you press the buttons. Some pressings haven't registered for some reason multiple times, but I guess I haven't pressed long enough to change a song (need to actually hold it and not just double tap like in regular headphones).Microphone: Bad. I don't care for this feature since I don't really make calls while I exercise (and if you do, you don't really workout and pretty annoying if that's in a public gym environment). Noise cancellation of the mic isn't good, but for me it's still a 5 star product. Some people may deduct a star for this though. Double tapping the Play button calls to the last person as well and tapping it once cancels/disconnects the call.Overall:* Great sound* Awesome portability* Pairing is plug and play. You can connect it to multiple devices at once* Remote control could be better/more sensitive but it's good overall* Mic is not good (or at least not good as the mic in the stock headphones you get with your iPhone)For $100, these headphones worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2361E1PA109X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLT54Q6#wasThisHelpful","R2361E1PA109X0","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was cleaning my soldering tips with water and a sponge for years until I discovered this brilliant soldering tip cleaning wire. The sponge and water is ""good"" but not great since it doesn't really remove the soldering wire on the tip from all the corners and buildup starts to form, which destroys the tip eventually.

"I tried to make it fair and let them burn-in for 40 hours or so. I would also like to note that I'm not an audiophile, but I do appreciate a balanced bass (not a basshead, but on the bassy side) and low/high mids.The Good:1. They stay in your ear, no matter what. These headphones have a top-notch build quality, and after trying on dozens of in-ear headphones, these are probably the best out there in terms of ideal fit. The box comes with more than enough ear tips so you can try on and adjust one for your ear canal. If this doesn't work, you can always purchase Comply Tsx-200 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pair, Mixed) or Comply T-200 Isolation Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pairs, S/M/L).2. Mic is comparable to Apple's headphones. This is something that is hard to find among headphones with a remote+mic. Usually the mic is horrible in terms of noise reduction and overall call quality.The Bad (unfortunately, here the T10i excel) :1. Sound quality is one of the most unbalanced out there. While I appreciate strong bass, the bass at this headphones, especially at a high volume, just kills the song and starts to have static-disturbance sound in some heavy bass songs. I tested this with many songs (320kbs/Flac quality) with an iPhone 6+, and at high volumes it just sounded like a one big mess. I would even argue that Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear - Black (Apple iOS version), which is $100 less, has a more balanced sound overall than the T10i.2. In continuation to #1, I think the company knows that their sound is unbalanced in the first place, so they provide you with a gimmicky screws that emphasize bass/treble and the ""in between"" reference mode. The reference is the most balanced, but again, one song can sound amazing, the other one is just a pure mess that you can't really understand what's going on. I even started to question my phone, but then I switched to different in-ear headphones, at the same volume level (highest for example) and everything was great again. I would say a ""hit or a miss"" in terms of sound, depends what you're listening to - but the tuning of these headphones overall is just bad - especially for $200 headphones. I wonder if people who reviewed this item as 5 starts with ""the most amazing sound I've ever heard"", really tried to listen to different in-ear headphones except for the junk Apple/Samsung give with their devices (or other stock headphones that come with music players/phones these days).3. I don't listen to music constantly throughout the day, so I put the headphones in my pocket and then put them on when I can. I do that about 5-8 times a day, and I find it a pain to adjust the ear tips to my ear every time I need to wear the headphones again. If you use it for a long periods of time without putting them on/off all day long, then you won't notice this issue. The problem is basically the adjustable cable that goes around your ear - while it helps a lot to keep the ear tips in your ears, it takes longer to adjust them every time you put the headphones on.4. They are heavy. Since they are made from stainless steal, you can feel it after an hour or so in your ear. I do appreciate that they don't fall off though while you walk (haven't tried while running, but I would guess the same).5. The buttons on the remote are blended in and hard to press on. Unlike Apple's remote, which is also blended in, the remote of the T10i is much less responsive while pressing on it. Changing a song becomes a pain, especially if you wear gloves.Overall, I was looking for great sound and a remote+mic, so I can also make calls. For $200 pre tax, I don't think these worth the money - especially in terms of sound quality. I think most of the money went here for the ergonomics, which is quite impressive for in-ear headphones, but soundwise it's far behind. If you purchase these headphones, you'll need to ask yourself the following question: are you willing to compromise sound quality for design and comfort?I prefer keeping my Sennheiser MOMENTUM In-Ear that fall from my ears here and there, but at least they have a better sound quality for half the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPE8P5SAYQIHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY2T9U2#wasThisHelpful","RPE8P5SAYQIHW","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great toy for the entire family. It's getting annoying at times to fold/unfold the starter track. It also gets dirty really quickly so wiping it is a must before and after every play. The cars are also going crazy after 2 races or so, so you need to wipe their wheels to keep them on track. Overall pretty neat gadget, but I wouldn't pay for it $150. It was $100 for several weeks during holidays, and I think it's a reasonable price compared to the price of each additional car ($50-80) since the starter kit has only 2 cars and it's good for 2 players only (or 1 Artificial Intelligent (computer) + 1 player). It's pretty boring to play with only 2 cars and at least 1 additional car purchase is a must I would say (get the orange one, it's the fastest :) ).

"The Good:1. Tastes amazing. Probably on the top of my list and I've tried almost any protein powder out there: ON (optimum), MusclePharm, MuscleMilk, Ultimate Nutrition, Dymatize, BSN, Universal, Gaspari, VPX, JYM, Champion, and the list continuous.2. Has high quality protein in it. It's a mix of Casein, and whey isolate.3. Low calorie and high protein %.The bad:1. The price. for 2lb that one of the most expensive protein powders out there. I understand this is due to the whey Isolate and casein mix, but that's not really important mix for most people who train casually at the gym. Unless Quest tried to market a premium product since the beginning, the price is a deal breaker IMO.2. Foam. When shaking the shaker, the liquid becomes really thick and there is always powder stick to the bottom of the shaker (Blender Bottle with the iron ball). It's annoying and the only way to overcome this inconvenience is to put the water + ice first and only then the powder.Overall, I think it would be better for people who like to cook with their protein powders, but less convenient for people like me who like to drink their shakes on the go. I also tried the Chocolate flavor, and I think they are both equal in terms of the above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPU2BN0ZUZW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDV0QCI#wasThisHelpful","R2BPU2BN0ZUZW4","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a proud owner of the 5000 series for the last 6 years and wanted to refresh a little bit. Here is why I returned my 7000 series:1. Very annoying stops in the middle of my brushing. The 5000 series has it as well, but the 7000 makes a complete stop for 1-2 seconds and then continues. It messes my entire ""auto-mode"" in the mornings.2. This 7000 series has an inferior battery. NiMH batteries die much quicker than Li-ion batteries. This is one of the reasons why your cell phones have the latter. The 5000 series (my brush) used to have Li-ion battery, but it looks like Oral-B (P&G) changed all their brushes to NiMH to save some $ and offer you a more expensive brush at the same time.3. Tongue mode is pretty useless. You will use it 1-2 times and then stop playing with the different brush modes and use only one.4. Travel case is nice, but how much do you really travel? You can also purchase a case separately for the 5000 series if that's important for you. Paying additional $60 for a travel case is pretty much absurd.5. The design is nice, but it's weird that the brush itself is white and the handle is black. Looks disconnected from each other - but who cares how your brush looks like?6. The charger doesn't support 240V. So if you travel outside the US - good luck with that. The old 5000 series supports both 110 and 240V. Current 5000 series doesn't support 240V anymore. Another way for Oral-B to increase their profit margin I guess.7. The battery last for approx. 10 days (with brushing twice a day for 2min). It takes about 20h to get a full charge.8. The blue light, while the brush is charging (flickering), can annoy some people. It's the most common complain online on this brush.Anyway, Amazon is lowering the price every couple of days now and playing between $160 and $130. There is a $30 coupon right now, so you can get it around $100 - don't pay more than that - it doesn't worth it.I will keep my 5000 series since it's still working and don't see currently any good alternatives on the market; Sonicare Diamond, for example, has only 31,000 strokes/minute while Oral-B has 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscilations (also known as 3D tooth by tooth cleaning).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KV7Z2NX2E93W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9X34XS#wasThisHelpful","R2KV7Z2NX2E93W","A2CECSSD2LHWQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CECSSD2LHWQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you can see from the rating, ""PowerBar"" is NOT one of those good kinds and here is why:1. Soy protein is listed first in the ingredients meaning these protein bars are mostly made out of soy protein. Is soy protein bad for you? not really but not good either. It has lower BV (biological value) than other kinds of proteins such as whey, which is listed last.2. It has 14g of sugar, which is not a deal breaker but there are better choices out there (Quest for example)3. It has canola oil in it. Not the best oil to consider (olive/coconut oils are better, but these would mess up the flavor although I'm not sure why there is oil here from the beginning (it's uncommon for protein bars to have that).The good:1. It tastes pretty good (vanilla flavor)2. Soft and not chewy at all3. Pretty cheap for a single protein bar.

"Me Before You by Jo Jo Moyes was an incredibly moving experience as I read. Its the type of book then ends perfectly and doesnt need a sequel, even with the Nicholas Sparks type ending. When I heard Jojo wrote a sequel with the continuing adventures of Louisa, I groaned. I should have acted like After You didnt existed. Im kicking myself because I read it. This is a sequel that should have never been written. Its an insult to Wills memory and makes me pity Louisa because she deserves so much more than this drivel Jojo created for her.The point of Me Before You was for Louisa is embrace life and live it to the fullest. That was Wills legacy for her. He made sure she was comfortable by leaving her money so she could travel, go to school or do whatever she had to in order to be happy. That doesnt happen. After You is almost two years after the events of Me Before You. Louisa is worst off than ever, a pitiful sad sack of a woman who really has no initiative or energy for anything because shes still mourning Will.Everything that happens to Louisa in this book is manipulative in order to get an emotional response from the reader. Louisa falls off the roof of her building, meets the daughter Will never knew he had, and drifts through her life with no direction. Even the new romance she has is weak. This entire story is weak and sad. It felt like someone else wrote it.After You is my most disappointing read of 2015. WTF was Jojo thinking?Katiebabs","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSB5H4VO99J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426590#wasThisHelpful","R2NSB5H4VO99J1","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like light and fluffy sci-fi romance with a yummy alien hero, Under His Skin, the first book in the Alien Encounters series by Stacey ONeale is the the book for you. Even though this is considered sci-fi romance, the sci-fi element is more in the background and reads more like a contemporary romance. But if you dont mind the more subtle sci-fi element, Stacey writes engaging characters, especially with Anna and Kaden, the main couple that should satisfy readers.Kaden, along with is brothers, are aliens working the the FBI. The reason theyre here on Earth is because their planet was destroyed. The have made their home on Earth, and are quite comfortable, even though the US government is always watching them. These men also have to be careful with human relationships with women so they dont end up bonding or mating with them. Kaden is in a bit of a bind because he has deep feelings and Anna, a baker whos also his closest friend. Shes definitely interested in taking things to the next level with him, but he purposely acts oblivious to her feelings because he cant have a relationship with her. As she dates other men, his jealousy grows, and soon his heartbeat is beating in time with hers, meaning shes his mate. But when Anna is targeted by a mysterious stalker, and the FBI comes around saying they have proof that more aliens from Kadens home planet are on Earth and might be out to cause problems, Kaden has to figure out a way to keep Anna safe and if h should reveal all to her.Under His Skin is a fun time read that is pretty predictable in terms of the romance and the story. Kaden and Anna have great chemistry. Both have adorable responses to one another in regards to their attraction. This is the type of romance that will give you a few hours of reading enjoyment.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9PO6D7PIG1QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CS5NXE#wasThisHelpful","R9PO6D7PIG1QN","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a modern re-telling of Beauty and the Beast, The Vixen and the Vet by Katy Regnery really hits the mark. If you like your heroes scarred, both emotionally and physically, who can find the joy in life again because of the tenacity and love of the heroine, this book is for you. The romance was very believable, with great sexy times. I think The Vixen and the Vet would be a great TV movie because it reads like a movie script.Savannah has returned home with her reputation and career in tatters because the man she thought she loved fed her false information on a huge story she was writing for a newspaper in order to save his father from going to jail. Feeling used and abused, Savannah licks her wounds in the arms of her family. Her younger sister is getting married to her long time boyfriend, and is obsessed with the wedding plans, which drives Savannah crazy. But then Savannah is given a second chance to redeem herself and possibly revive her career. A fellow journalist who thought Savannah got the raw deal tells her about a freelance writing opportunity for a magazine. But Savannah has to write a human interest story. Savannah isn't thrilled about the topic, but she doesn't have many choices. She decides to write about a hometown hero- Asher Lee, a wounded veteran who has holed up in his family's house for the past 8 years.Asher was the small town golden boy, complete with the looks, family name and money. While on a tour in Afghanistan, a bomb blows up, almost killing him. He lives, but sustains horrible wounds. His right arm is missing below the elbow, he doesn't have an ear, and half of his face has horrible scarring. Because people either wince in disgust or fear when they see his face, he remains locked in his home. What he doesn't count on is Savannah coming along and bringing joy back into his life.At first Asher refuses to see Savannah, even though she brings him homemade baked goods to tempt him into seeing her. Her brownies are the reason he lets her in, and agrees to the interview. Savannah's reaction to Asher is typical, but eventually she stops seeing the ""beast"", and see the heroic and amazing man behind the scar tissue. One kiss from Asher, and Savannah no longer thinks of Asher as the subject of her human interest story, but a hot blooded man she wants as a lover.The Vixen and The Vet is a title that 's a bit deceiving. Savannah isn't a ""vixen"" (I guess her vixen comes out in the bedroom when she and Asher get it on). Both these characters are very bright and intuitive to each others needs. It doesn't take long for Savannah to fall for Asher's charms. The reader does also, forgetting what Asher looks like on the outside. Asher is one hot hero! He has a great personality and sense of humor, which Savannah is attracted to. He has some PTSD, but it's mainly as nightmares and his fear of being out in public. He has a chance at undergoing surgery and using a bionic arm if he so chooses. Asher also doesn't have to worry about working or money because he has enough at his disposal, which really isn't explained that well. But I guess that's where the fairy tale like atmosphere comes into play. Asher isn't limited with his handicap. He's like any normal man. Savannah sees this right from the start. Their passion is explosive and very well written.There's some unneeded drama with Savannah and her sister. Savannah goes to her sister's bachelorette party. Her fiance is also there with his friends, including his sleazy brother who almost rapes Savannah. That scene, and what follows after, and how Asher reacts just rubbed me the wrong way. It really didn't make any sense to have Savannah attacked and for Asher to be her knight in shining armor. This plot device took something special away from the overall story and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Other than this misstep from the author, The Vixen and the Vet was an enjoyable read. The last quarter of the novel, and the effects of Savannah's article on Asher is very emotional and may make some readers weepy-eyed because of how Asher survived after the bombing that took so much away from him. The end specifically is extremely well done.The Vixen and the Vet has a lot of heart behind it with the portrayal of Asher and Savannah. This is one book I would definitely recommend to others.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8VJAJR137XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991204549#wasThisHelpful","R2L8VJAJR137XJ","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If youve read Wicked as The Come, youre in for a treat with Wicked Ever After, the 4th and final book in Delilah S. Dawsons Blud series. In a nutshell, this is Tishs HEA with Criminy, the sexy bludman who is one my my favorite heroes in the last five years in paranormal romance. Delilah gives these two quite a sendoff that wont disappoint!Wicked Ever After occurs six years after Tish came to the Sang, basically living there as Crims beloved wife, while she goes back to Earth to check in on her dying grandmother, Nana. Tish has a big problem. She has aged drastically while in the Sang. Only 32, she looks closer to 60. Because she wont become a full blown bludman like her husband, who can live hundreds of years and still look young, shell continue to age and may even die. But when she goes under to check on her grandmother on Earth, shes the same as when she first entered the Sang because six years in Sang is only a few weeks on Earth. The reason Tish wont become a Blud is because she cant leave her dying grandmother alone. Once Tish is a Blud, shes no longer human, stuck in Sang forever. Crim makes a good case for Tish to change over. Crim adores and loves Tish. He lusts after her every chance he can get, not caring that shes aging. But then Tish has an idea. Shell bring her sick Nana, who is dying of cancer to the Sang. Then Crim will transform her into a Blud.What follows for Tish after Nana comes to the Sang and becomes a Blud is a catastrophe for Tish. Nana, who only wants to be called by her real name of Ruby is healed, and looks much younger and vibrant, but has a personality transplant. Shes not the same woman who loved and raised Tish. Ruby wants to go off on her own and live her life that passed her by for so long. She doesnt want to stick around and build a happy little family Tish assumed they would have. Ruby disappears with Crims strong man to possibly fight a witch that caused Tish incredible grief the first time around. Now Tish, along with Crim will go to London to find Ruby and hopefully defeat the evil witch. But Will Tish become Blud before she does?Wicked Ever After is a rip-roaring adventure set in an alternate universe thats supernatural, paranormal, and some Steampunk type elements. The setting and characters are rich and flavorful. Tish and Crim are an incredible couple with great chemistry. Crim is the big draw in reading here. Tish is torn between both worlds. You understand why she has stayed human for so long, mainly because of her grandmother, and the traits she takes for granted as a human (food is a big reason). But being a Blud has great advantages, which Crim shows her, from staying young for centuries, to great sex, and incredible strength and power. The downside is his world is filled with constant danger. But Tish has Crim and many friends to protect her.The last quarter of this tale has a lot of great actions, some twists, and Tish finally coming into her own. The ending is everything lovely. A nice HEA that will make you smile.Im so glad Delilah let us revisit Tish and Crim again. A nice goodbye to a great romantic couple. Dont miss out on this one!Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS831T3ZGR557/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQP0O#wasThisHelpful","RS831T3ZGR557","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Out of Office Girl by Nicola Doherty is a sweet Chick-Lit in the vein of Bridget Jones but mainly takes place in Italy. Alice isn't in Italy for vacation. She's a publishing assistant, who hopes one day to be an head editor at the publishing company she has worked at for four years. Her boss is a nightmare, but Alice remains silent, hoping she'll get a promotion. The publishing company is hoping for a big hit with the tell all biography of superstar actor, Luther. But he's dragging his feet with his ghostwriter in an Italian villa on the company's dime. When Alice's boss has emergency surgery, Alice flies out to work with Luther, who she has always had a celebrity crush on.Things for Alice go bad from the moment she arrives in Italy. Her luggage is lost, she finds out she forget to put a big clause in Luther's contract that could ruin the entire book, and Luther's agent Sam is rude and cold to her. He doesn't want Luther to write the tell all and thinks Alice will manipulate Luther to spill all his secrets. Also Luther's sexy co-star hates Alice on sight and puts her down every chance she can get. Luther is nice to her, but comes across as lazy and entitled. But then she has a breakthrough with him and he's spilling all his secrets to her to Sam's dismay. Alice has so much stress to deal with and the fear that she may lose her job. Sam acts hot and cold with her, which confuses her because she is attracted to him, but he still acts like a jerk most of the time, even though he has moments where he can be sweet and tries to make her laugh.The Out of Office Girl doesn't have a lot of grand gestures or shocks. It's a very character driven novel where the reader is placed in Alice's shoes. She puts up with so much crap from these entitled Hollywood and publishing types who seem to take advantage of her. Alice's backbone isn't strong enough to tell these people to shove it, although her inner monologues and thoughts are funny to read. You do sympathize with her and want her to come out the winner.There's too much miscommunication on the part of Alice and Sam that didn't make sense to me, especially when it comes to a specific section that really changes their relationship. It looks like it was done to keep up the drama and make Alice suffer more, which was really unneeded. The ending makes up for it though.Those who enjoy chick-lit with romance, set in a place like Italy, which was really well written, should check out The Out of Office Girl.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16FLS6F2AHIDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=075538685X#wasThisHelpful","R16FLS6F2AHIDF","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here All Along (Kelly Brothers #7) by Crista McHugh is a nice contemporary romance about best friends who are perfect for one another. The joy in reading is because of the hero, Gideon, whos head over heels in love with hie best friend/assistant Sarah. These two mesh so well together, but in order or to have a story, we need drama and some angst, which happens when Gideon wants more than just friendship with Sarah. Unfortunately for Gideon, Sarah is afraid to rock the boat of their relationship. If she becomes Gideons lover, shell be forced into the spotlight again, which almost got her killed.Gideon is a big time actor, who is filming in Las Vegas for his next movie. He relies on Sarah, his favorite person in the world. Shes his loyal assistant who always keeps him on track. Sarah knows the Hollywood lifestyle and atmosphere all too well. She was once a teen star who crashed and burned hard. She even won a Golden Globe for one of her last performances, but got addicted to alcohol, drugs and partying. She ended up in a car accident because of her substance abuse. She recovers with the help of Gideon. Three years later shes under the radar, totally forgotten by the press and the public. Shes spend her free time designing clothes in the hopes she can become a fashion designer. She does love working for Gideon, but she feels its time to move on. The sticky thing is, Gideon kissed her a few months ago, and she knows he wants more than what they currently have. Sarah is afraid to ruin what she has with Gideon, who will try to pull out all the stop to convince her to be his girl.These two go to Vegas where Gabe, Gideons co-star recognizes Sarah. He thinks she would be a great addition to the movie, even though Gideon warns him to leave Sarah alone. Gideon tries his best to prove to Sarah how right they are for one another, but shes stubborn and wont give in. But then the word gets out about Sarah, and the director of the movie may force her to back into the spotlight and ruin everything for her and Gideon for good.The reason to read Here All Along is because of Gideon. Hes so gone over Sarah that no other woman holds a candle to her. You really feel for the guy because he wears his heart on his sleeve, but Sarah lives in fear because of her past addictions, including her normalcy she abides by. She has basically hid in plain sight since her accident, and still feels shame for the way she has turned out, as well as relying on Gideons good graces for far too long. Sarahs self-flagellation became tiresome, but her interactions with Gideon makes up for it. These two have great chemistry.The story loses some steam toward the end because Sarah refuses to let go and accept all that Gideon wants to give her. I found Gabe to be a throw away character. He was very annoying and didnt really bring anything substantial to the story as a whole. He came across as this annoying spoiled kid who pushes Gideons buttons for no reason.If you like a romance featuring a hero who is extremely loyal and dedicated to the heroine, including the behind the scenes atmosphere of movie making and Hollywood, then Here All Along should appeal to you.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T5FSZZEGGBFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLNDHAC#wasThisHelpful","R1T5FSZZEGGBFK","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of New Adult set in college will eat Sacked by Jen Frederick up. This is exactly the type of book a New Adult should be. When it comes to romances set in college, aka NA, Ive become wary of reading them because the majority are caricatures of what college life is with the concentration on the hero, or the heroines love interest being a egotistical walking STD, or the heroine having such a tortured past by the age of 21 that you wonder why shes not in sitting in a corner rocking because she has been abused so horrible. That is definitely not the case with Sacked. This book is a breath of fresh air, and makes me remember my college days fondly.The reason to read Sacked is for Knox Masters. Knox is the complete package woman drool over, and who men wish they could be. Knox also has a very open secret thats not really a secret at all. At 21, Knox is still a virgin, one who has only gone to second base with a girl and nothing more. Why you may ask? Its not because of his religion or sexual issues, abuse in his past or some hang up he has. Knox hasnt had sex yet because he hasnt found the right woman for him. The great thing is, Knoxs teammates and friends, even the entire college doesnt care. They think its cool and let Knox do his thing. Knox is a god at the college he attends because hes an incredible quarterback who has a great shot at the NFL. Hes smart, kind, and very handsome. Knox is an all around great guy with a twin brother at another college who also plays football. When Sacked begins, he spots a girl at the universitys football stadium at the crack of dawn. At first he thinks shes a football groupie, but as soon as he talks to her, he knows shes more than that. Ellies brother Jack is a new player on the football team. Shes also athletic (she likes playing softball), and even had aspirations at a sport career, which was sidelined when she was hurt (she has scarring on her knees). Within a few minutes of talking with Ellie, Knox is smitten. He knows Ellie is the one hell not only lose his virginity to, but shell eventually have his last name because hell end up marrying her. He tells his brother the Earth moved when he met Ellie. Can we say awww?Ellie thinks Knox is conceited, as most football players are based on her own experience with them in high school. Shes mainly at college to help Jack pass his classes. Her parents thinks shes worthless for no real reason as to why (this subplot was my biggest issue overall, and it annoyed me to no end because it didnt seem to serve any purpose.). If there was a real reason why her parents act like shes the redheaded stepchild, then maybe it wouldnt have been the big downer of the story. But even with her parents, specifically her mother being the Wicked Witch Bitch, Ellie isnt too scarred emotionally. Shes actually very well rounded and mature. Jack is a great support, including her roommate Riley. Then there is Knox who wont leave her along. Ellies thinks hes lying about his virgin status just to get in her pants. As she gets to know Knox, she finds out hes the real deal. Knox is very patient and takes his time with Ellie so she trusts him. And when she does, watch out because its explosive in so many ways.Sacked rates high for me, up there with the first round of NA college setting romances that came out in in 2012 and 2013. Knox is truly a prince among men. Jen makes the perfect case why we need more virgin heroes in contemporary romance. The way she has written Knox is awesome. The way he and Ellie click was so much fun to read. Because Knox is so steadfast with waiting for the right woman to make love to, there is some OMG hotness foreplay that goes on between these two, specifically one scene where Ellie catches Knox taking himself in the hand so to speak, and she watches as he pleasures himself. Yee haw. And when trust has been established between these two, and Knox surrenders, more hotness all around. Jen can sure write some steamy love scenes.Friendship is a big theme here, which we see with Knox and his teammates, and with Ellie and Riley. Even Knox and Ellie become friends before they become a couple. This is a slice of college life not usually shown in romance like this. Every character here is engaging and special.Theres a big twist I would have never expected that made me go, whoa. It brings forth a humdinger of a HEA for Knox and Ellie. It was a little sudden, but it gave me many happy feels.Sacked was a true joy to read, and Knox will probably end up being one of my favorite heroes of 2015. This is the type of book I wanted to hug and keep on hugging. Loved it!Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRQSVEF2CR8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K7YSHO#wasThisHelpful","R3GRQSVEF2CR8U","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading a Penny Watson book is always a big treat. Every single one of her books I've read always makes me smile. Her past few books, thanks to self-publishing (with has unlocked an amazing creativity with Penny's writing) has really flexed her creative juices. A Taste of Heaven is a perfect example of why self-published is amazing, mainly because traditional publishing can be blind to books that should be published and promoted heavily for the masses. A Taste of Heaven is such a book that should be on every romance reader's lips because it's unique in the sense because of the main characters. The hero and heroine are considered way past their prime (in some literary circles) in having a sexy, passionate love affair that engages all the senses. A Taste of Heaven does that, and more, not just because the hero and heroine love to cook and create to die for dishes. It's mainly because the heroine is a 47 year old widow with two adult daughters. The hero is a near 50, bald, redheaded bearded, stubborn, three times divorced Scots. When these two characters come together, they not only heat up the kitchen in ways that will make readers lick their lips and cause their stomachs growl, but also in the bedroom where the hero shows the heroine the delights of his ""Scottish Knob"".Sophia lost her beloved, absent-minded husband a few years ago. They were married for over two decades, and now that Sophia is a widow, she feels adrift with no real purpose. Her two daughters are very supportive of their mother, but they worry for her. The only joy Sophia has now is cooking. One of her daughters sends in an application on Sophia's behalf for a reality cooking show in the area called Taste of Heaven. Sophia decides to go on the show to appease her daughters. She finds out that a professional chef will team up with an amateur chef. These duos will have to impress three judges big time in order to win the $50,000 prize and a chance at stardom. Since Sophia is an amateur, she teams up with Elliott, who at first glance annoys her immensely. Elliott is boorish, rude, and a bit of a food snob. He's not happy he has to compete with stay at home mommy chefs like Sophia. He's there for a very specific reason, and he aims to win. No one will get in his way, not even Sophia, who he nicknames a garden sprite. But he has no choice but to work with Sophia, who is his complete opposite in every way.It's definitely not smooth sailing for these two. Sophia may seems prim and proper, but she's no pushover. She refuses to bend to Elliott's dictates. Eventually as they cook together and get to know one another, they come to agreement and will compromise. Once they do, that's when things get very interesting, because their original disdain for one another has changed into something very special that involves flirting, mainly from Elliott, who enjoys ruffling his adorable sprite's feathers.A Taste of Heaven is exactly what the title says. This story is a succulent taste of fiction heaven. This one is going in my top 10 for 2015. There's so much to enjoy about this novel. The behind the scenes reality show aspect is great, especially all the incredible mouth watering dishes Elliott and Sophia come up with (can Penny publish a cookbook as a companion guide?). Elliott and Sophia sparkle, more so than any other couple Penny created. This is also Penny's steamiest novel to date. Elliott is a smooth talker, a Lothario who seduces Sophia with his sexy accent and words. The chemistry between these two is top notch. Elliott is also a big old teddy bear when it comes to Sophia. He allows Sophia to see a side of him no one else has seen.The ending is everything a HEA should be. The aww factor is high here, not only with the way Elliott and Sophia fall for one another, but the relationship with her daughters. The way the girls welcome Elliott in heir mother's life is very sweet.A Taste of Heaven will quench your appetite for all things romance, especially one with such heart. A winning romance, and slice of fiction that gave me so many feels while I read.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U66DHN7RLHZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RM9JS0#wasThisHelpful","R1U66DHN7RLHZ0","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Devoted in Death is the 41st book in this futuristic series by JD Robb, aka Nora Roberts. It takes place in the beginning of 2061, which is only 2 years or so from the first book, Naked in Death, which was published in 1995. If youre a fan of the In Death series, Devoted in Death is pretty much the same like every other book prior. A horrible homicide, or homicides have happened, and its up to Lieutenant Eve Dallas to speak for the dead, and find the people responsible for ending innocent lives.Whats a little different here, is right from the start we know who the killers are. Its a sick couple, Ella-Loo and Darryl on a crime spree across the US, landing in NYC (I wonder if theyre loosely based on the main couple from the movie, Natural Born Killers). Ella-Loo and Darryl are low class trash who are very dedicated to one another. After killing someone, which is an accident, they hide the body. They get off on the killing and are hot and horny, so much so that they become blood thirsty and want to kill (moving to torture) more people because they find it to be great foreplay for them.Eve is back on the job after a long vacation at someplace warm with Roarke. Her first day back, shes called to investigate a body of man who was tortured, with the initials E&D carved in his body. After investigating further, Eve finds out that this isnt an isolated case, and there are more bodies, over 20 of various men and women who died the same way. And when a woman is snatched off the street, Eve and her crew are on a race against the clock to stop the serial killer couple from killing again.Devoted in Death is very easy reading with the emphasis on the case, more so than the personal lives of Eve and Roarke, although we do get snippets of their personal time. Eve and Roarke are still in the honeymoon phase, so they make love whenever they can, which is plenty here to please readers. The good old candy thief strikes again, and many secondary characters, such as Peabody, McNabb, and others round out the story. The way the case evolves is fascinating. I was hooked by how Eve was able to figure out who Ella-Lo and Darryl are, and why theyre addicted killing. Roarke is more of a tag along here for Eve, but because hes so amazing (I have a bad Roarke crush), hes very noticeable throughout the story. Eves snark is more toned down, but shes more lovey-dovey with Roarke, proving that these two are so in sync with one another.Devoted in Death is a solid read and pretty good police procedural (many mentions of auto chefs has me dying for one of my own!). Again, In Death fans will eat this latest up.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3884411KQTXA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917088X#wasThisHelpful","R3884411KQTXA5","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The CEO Buys In (Wager of Hearts #1) by Nancy Herkness takes the familiar trope of the semi-emotional scarred billionaire hero who hooks up with the, dedicated and sweet ""living paycheck to paycheck"" heroine, and give it a unique premise. This premise that kept me interested is because of the first chapter. The hero Nathan is at his rich man's club (reminds me of a scene from a regency historical romance novel where the titled hero ends up at White's) drinking away his sorrows. The woman he was involved with, and whom he was thinking of marrying (not because he was head over heels in love with her, but she suited his needs as the right type of woman), is a con. She targeted him because of his fortune and role as a CEO of his company. While he's there, two other man chat him up. One is a best selling author, who currently has a major case of writer's block, and the other a famous NFL football star. They lament on their lacking love lives. Nathan doesn't believe in love. So they make a bet. They have a year to fall in love. Whoever is the last man standing without the love of their life, loses something big they own. This has a feel of a historical romance novel all the way with the whole, you must find your bride in a year or you'll lose everything you ever wanted. Nathan goes along with it because he's bored, or maybe it's because he's drunk?There's Chloe, the office temp, who lives with her beloved grandmother, Grandmillie. She owes so much to her grandmother, who is getting on in her years. As a temp, Chloe makes very little, refusing to get a full time job at any big time corporations where she could have stability and more money because of her father who was wronged by the company he worked for. On the first day of her new temp job at Nathan's company, she given a raise of sorts. Nathan needs a temporary secretary/assistant for a few days. Chloe is wary working for the big man of the company, but still accepts the job. In the beginning both Nathan and Chloe don't have a real opinion about one another. But then Nathan falls ill- he has the flu, and Chloe is forced to work with him at his apartment because she soothes him while he's really sick. Eventually he recovers, and he begins to see Chloe in a new light, which means sparks flying, attraction building, and a passionate romance that may or may not have an end date.The CEO Buys In should appeal to fans of contemporary romance with rich heroes like Nathan. He's not too douchey, and for the most part very sweet to Chloe as soon as he realizes she's something special. He does wine and dine her abd gives her nice things, but Chloe is there to give him a reality check. Like most romance heroines, she's not wowed by his money and the things he can do for her. She knows her place as an administrative assistant who is barely straddling the middle class with a grandmother who needs special medical attention that Chloe can't afford. She's the voice of reason, while Nathan is more of a, let's go with the flow, type of guy. Chloe surrenders to a point when it comes to the physical end of their relationship (Nathan gives new mean to the mile high club for Chloe in his private plane). These two are more analytical than spur of the moment type of people, unless it comes to sex.There is the typical misunderstanding that arises near the end to create drama for Nathan and Chloe. The way it's fixed is pretty typical in a romance like this. But at least we get to see what Nathan was willing to sacrifice for his shot at falling in love.The CEO Buys In is a solid romance with an overall nice couple, and some enjoyable love scenes.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HQDQKN4AS00Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503944093#wasThisHelpful","R1HQDQKN4AS00Z","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Bridge to a Better Life (Dare Valley #8) by Ava Miles should be a winner of a romance. It has so much to offer with appealing characters, great setting, a too good to be true hero (who is also a sexy retired NFL football player still head over heels in love with his ex-wife), and a cute beagle named Touchdown. The big blaring issue with his book that almost made me DNF is the heroine and her reasons why she divorces her loving prince of a husband. That premise is a big fail whale because of the heroine, who is overall one of the most annoying heroines Ive read this year so far. Natalie doesnt deserve Blake,. The way the author tries to explain why Natalie turned away from him and became distance doesnt make sense at all. She shuts down in every which way because her sister-in-law, her brothers wife, and her best friend has died of cancer. Instead of The Bridge to a Better Life dealing with a still married husband and wife trying to save their marriage, and the heroine working through her grief, we have a confusing and ridiculous plot point to cause too much unneeded tension for the main couple and the long road the poor hero has to take in order to get back his wife, who treats him horribly. Because of the heroines selfishness, I couldnt believe in their HEA at all.Blake is a mega NFL superstar (think Tom Brady) who retires from the NFL right in the middle of an outstanding career. The reason is because he wants to get his ex-wife Natalie back who divorced him 2 years ago after her sister-in-law, Kim died of cancer. Because Natalie is so grief stricken, she divorces Blake for reasons that dont make any sense. Blake moves to the small town she now resides in, even moving into the house next to hers and building an actual bridge between their properties. He will do whatever he can to get Natalie back. Why? Because he loves her so much and they belong together. He takes baby steps with her by becoming her friend, which she accepts, and then going on innocent dates, until their attraction for one another cant be ignored. Natalie still loves Blake, but cant be with him, stringing him along because she is still suffering over the loss of her sister-in-law. Its cruel of me to say this, and people deal with death of family and friends in different ways, but its not like Natalie lost a child or even a parent. Maybe if we had flashbacks of Natalie and Kims relationship, it would make better sense. But because we are only told about Kim, and not shown, there is no sympathy toward Kim, her husband, and Natalies feelings. I felt Natalie was beyond selfish. Her actions and motivations arent noble or admirable. Shes a heroine I cant connect with or would want to. I wanted Blake to find someone else more worthy of his love.I would have given The Bridge to A Better Life a solid B grade aka 3 stars because if not for Natalie, it really is a nice romance. The writing grabs you, there are nice moments of humor, and Blake is a near perfect book boyfriend. But this fails on the delivery because of Natalie, a heroine who isnt what I feel a heroine should embody. I wish this would have been about Blake moving on from his selfish ex-wife and finding a woman who completes him and respects him. Very disappointing. Pass on this one.Katiebabs","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENIMKX5FZ7HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XK4GB7O#wasThisHelpful","RENIMKX5FZ7HV","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You can't go wrong with a hottie, by the book sheriff and his attraction toward an animal rights activist who sometimes drives him up the wall, but in the same turn, wants to kiss the daylights out of her, and keep on kissing her as his way to keep her in line. Ever After (Love to the Rescue #3) by Rachel Lacey has a whole lot of cute going on. A little off the wall, but has a lot of heart on the pages with cute doggy antics, and some great chemistry between the hero and heroine, who are complete opposites.Olivia was arrested by Pete because of a dare. She had one too many drinks to celebrate her birthday, and her two friends dared her to paint graffiti on a tower at a chicken processing plant that she found out has been abusing the chickens before they are slaughtered. As Olivia is in the process of finishing her graffiti, she's caught and taken to jail by Pete, a sheriff who hopes to be detective one day. Pete is a very dedicated police officer, who follows the rules in every aspect of his life. At first he seems like a distant, cold fish type. The reason is because his father, who was a substance abuse addict, ended up killing a man in a car accident, and is now in jail. Pete lives with the shame of his father, who never respected his wife or kids. Pete spends most of his private time baking cupcakes for a women's shelter (awww), and becoming the dad to a dog who was training as a police dog, but failed (double aww). When he meets Olivia, he's thrown for a loop because she's a rebel with a heart who he can't help but like.Olivia ends up in court, but is forced to do community service instead of being arrested.

"Touched By Angels by Peggy Webb (Loveswept #538, published in 1992) is a very sweet and emotional story about two emotionally scarred individuals, who by meeting through some interesting circumstance learn to heal the pain in their hearts. The hero is your stereotypical brooding man with money to spend, who learns to forgive himself and toss away the guilt over his daughter's death he felt he caused by falling for the heroine, a mother of a mentally handicapped four-year-old daughter.Jake is a man on running on empty who also has a death wish. Ever since his beloved daughter Bonnie died in a car crash, he's consumed with guilt. As he drives haphazardly on a winding road, he almost runs over a four-year-old girl in the middle of the road. Jake swerves, and misses her, saving her from death. The little girl doesn't seem upset or crying. She's very calm and serene. Suddenly the mother, Sarah Love runs out, finding her daughter to her relief, who wandered off from their new home. Sarah is a single mother, whose husband left because he couldn't handle Jenny, who is mentally handicapped. Sarah calls Jenny special. She and Jenny have moved into a fixer upper of a house where Sarah will open a store and sell her homemade dolls that have become a hot commodity. Jake is shaken by Sarah and Jenny because they make him feel whole again. He runs away from them, and tries not think of the beautiful woman with an adorable pixie daughter. But Jake can't stay away, and soon he becomes a big part of Sarah and Jenny's lives.Sarah appears as pure as the driven snow, and so understanding to Jake, who she can see is hurting inside. She's fine with him being friends with Jenny, which may seems strange, because why would a mother be okay with an adult man befriending a little girl? But Jake is more like a father figure to Jenny, and for Sarah, he's like a knight in shining armor for her.Touched by Angels isn't too deep or meaningful, even with the character of Jenny, who gets her own story in a Prince for Jenny, a sequel of sorts where Jenny is an adult woman who has become a famous painter. This is a fast read, which is the case for most of these vintage Loveswept category romances. The sexual tension is there, but minimal, and the foreplay and actual sex (there is one sex scene) is more glossed over and PG-13.If you enjoy reading about a tortured hero finding redemption with a single mother and her strange, yet special daughter, Touched by Angels might be the novella for you.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84NW6K0SQPHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050COP5Y#wasThisHelpful","R84NW6K0SQPHR","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caught Up in the Touch (Falcon Football #2) by Laura Trentham is a pretty typical contemporary romance with a main couple you root for. The hero and heroine have endearing and unique personalities, but the story has a been there, done that feel to it. Readers of small town romance will probably enjoy this one, including a hero, who loves to cook and who the heroine nicknames, Mountain Man.Jessica, for all intensive purposes, is a shrewd business woman. Her power suits and high heels are her costume as she works for her cold and at times boorish father, who also gives her personal jabs that does a number on her self esteem. But Jessica hides her feelings because she wants to rise to the top of her fathers company. She has the experience and is dedicated to her work. But her father dangles that carrot constantly over her head. Montgomery Sr. is surrounded by yes men and is never told no. But Logan Wilde has done that. Senior wants Logan to come work for him and operate a flagship restaurant. In order for Jessica to get what she wants, her father sends to her Logans backwater town in Alabama to convince Logan to work for the Montgomery name by any means necessary.Jessica treats this as a mission. Logan is a hometown boy through and through. When he was a teen, he was a a bit of a rebel, but after joining the army, and being much more considerate to his loving grandma, he matured and left behind his rebellious ways. Hes opened a restaurant in his home town, where he does all the cooking. Hes also the coach for the high school football team. Logan loves his life and doesnt want anything more. But then Jessica comes roaring into it. When she first meets him, she has no clue who he is. Logan had a rough morning and is scruffy (think hot beard), dirty and exhausted. He doesnt tell Jessica who he is. She thinks hes just a member of Logans staff. She nicknames him Mountain Man in her head because hes so tall, large and bearded (rowl). When she has car problems, he lends her a helping hand, including a place to stay for the time shes there- a new B&B run by a friend. Eventually she figures out her Mountain Man is Logan, and thats where the fun starts for both of them.Jessica tries her hardest to convince Logan to take her fathers very generous offer. Logan refuses to be convinced, but he likes having Jessica around. Shes Jessie to him, and hes very turned on by her long legs and her high heels. She also not skittish about hanging out with him in the woods when he wants to get away (even in those high heels she loves wearing). They bond, flirt and then their attraction blooms to the point that Jessica wants to chuck it all away and stay with Logan in his backwater town. But here are big obstacles for these two. Jessicas father wants to win, and has a card underneath his sleeve regarding Logans father. Plus there might be a steroid problems among Logans players on the football team he has to deal with. Plus can Jessica give up everything shes worked so hard for?Caught Up in the Touch is a simple love story with nice characters. Even with the subplot of drug and steroid use in high school sports, and Logans family issues, as well as Jessicas tempestuous relationship with her father, there arent many grand gestures here or explosive action. Logan and Jessica have good chemistry together, but they take their time before they act on their attraction (lots of kissing before the sex). But the I love yous come on too fast to be believable. But overall, I did enjoy Caught Up in the Touch. The ending is too pat and predictable, but it has a HEA, which after all, works.Caught Up in the Touch is a solid romance with likable characters. A pretty okay read to spend a few hours lost in.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L45NF8BG9TDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEQKHLY#wasThisHelpful","R3L45NF8BG9TDY","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to a Meredith Duran novel, you know youre getting near perfection. Every words Meredith writes is golden, and pure poetry. So is the case with Lady Be Good, the third book in her Rules for the Reckless series. The story might feel familiar, but the way its presented is new and fresh, and very lyrical. Case in point is one of my favorite segments from this novel:Touch her, indeed. One of her cheeks bore a smudge. He very much wished to remove it for her. With his tongue.That small excerpt, like many more in this novel, made me swoon on the inside. The way the hero and hero talk and think, including their seductive dance with one another is so deliciously sexy. And sexy is big here, especially when they hero and heroine finally give into the temptation of the flesh for one another, knowing they can only live in the moment because anyone the hero loves or cares for is marked for death by a madmen. The heroine is so far below his station, or believes it, because shes a former thief and con artist with a mob type underworld ruler for an uncle.The heroine here is Lilah. We first meet her in the prologue where shes stuck literately in a hard place- between two walls as she hides from the police. The only way she can escape is to dislodge her shoulder. She must in order to save her very ill sister. Her immoral Uncle Nick pushes her to hurt herself, not necessarily because he cares for her well being, but because he uses her skill for his own greedy ways. Lilahs sacrifice to save her sister is a lost cause. We move forward a few years where Lilah now works as one of the hostesses for an auction house. She has self taught herself to speak and act like a lady, trying to leave behind her past in Whitechapel where her uncle still rules. Uncle Nick is still trying to pull her strings, blackmail her into doing what he wants. He wants her to steal letters from Peter Everleigh, half owner of the auction house with his sister Catherine, known as the Ice Queen. But Lilah is caught stealing by Christian, a war hero and respected viscount. She thinks the jig is up and shell have to return back to her old life with her uncle, the one she despises.Christian suffers silently. He was once captured by a Russian general during war, who blames Christian for killing his family. Instead of killing Christian, hell kill anyone Christian loves. His older brother died in a fire because of the madman, and now his mother and sister might be next. Christian searches for the Russian, finding him through Everleighs. When he catches Lilah in Peters office, he assumes the worst. But instead of turning her in, hell blackmail her, forcing her to be the assistant to Catherine, who will go to one of his estates to catalog any artifacts and the like. Lilah obeys because she doesnt have any choice.Lilah hates being controlled by not only Christian, but by Nick. Catherine comes across as a snobbish, shrew of a woman, but a very intelligent and independent one, who is very honest in her opinion of Lilah. Christian decides to court Catherine, perhaps to make her his wife. But he has an ulterior motive why. Lilah is confused by him because he also flirts with her and makes her want him. Christian wants Lilah, but cant offer her more than an affair. After some push and pull on her part, and Christians subtle ways of seduction, she gives in. But then Catherine falls violently ill, which might be the Russian at work, which puts Christian back on the defenses, knowing he might have put both Catherine and Lilah in extreme danger.Lady Be Good is unbelievably good. Christian is a worthy hero, but he taunts Lilah in a way that will make readers grit their teeth in frustration. Lilah is the true star of this story, as well as Catherine. My favorite scenes are the interactions between both women. The way Catherine thaws slowly with Lilah is lovely. These two end up as a great team in more ways than one. These two end up saving themselves  without the help of their male counterparts that will make you applaud. The girl power here is very high.When Christian and Lilah share barbs with one another, as their form of foreplay, you cant help but sigh. They take their time poking and prodding one another as their sexual frustrations reach a fevered pitch. The love scenes are a very nice climax indeed.I was also intrigued by the secondary characters. Catherines brother Peter might seem to be a future villain, but theres something about him that makes me think hes not all that bad. Catherine is at odds with him, making the reader believe that Peter might want to get rid of her but we only see that through Catherines eyes. She ends up the heroine in the next book, Luck Be a Lady, with Nick as her hero. Nick is shown as this sly, witty, somewhat slimy criminal. But hes very engaging and you do get the sense he cares for Lilah, but he always needs a reward for his trouble. His reward will be Catherine. Their interactions and romance should have some major fireworks as he unleashes the passions Catherine hides within.Lady be Good is an excellent Victorian historical romance because its the writing is so flavorful and creative. This is another tasty treat from Meredith that shouldnt be missed.Katiebabs","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HIJ9VAAKAJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476741379#wasThisHelpful","R29HIJ9VAAKAJ3","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fans of rock star romances will enjoy True North (True #1) by Liora Blake, especially because the heroine is a widow who has become a best selling author. The hero is a punk rapper, which was somewhat different and strange, in a good way. You end up rooting for these two big time and their HEA, although the beginning takes some warming up to (or at least it did for me).Kate comes from a very small town (think farm land, cows on the road, and not having to lock doors to houses). Shes a widow whos still trying to get over the death of her beloved husband. She blames herself for his death since she was driving the car and crashed. She has a job as the local paper, which she finds dull. Even though her one book she wrote and published is a big best seller, it hasnt changed her life all that much. But now things are moving along for her. Her agent has booked her on some talk shows on the West Coast. She goes along with her agents plan, and experiences the superstar type Hollywood lifestyle. The first talk show is where she meets Trax, a popular punk/rapper who has a big personality and knows how to work the audience. Kate isnt that impressed with Trax because of his public persona. Hes very different from the norm. But when Trax calls her to ask her out on a date, shes shocked. She thinks hes pulling a fast one on her. But Trax, whos real name is Trevor is very different in private. Hes polite, sweet and endearing. Plus he wont give up until Kate gives him a chance.Kate realizes she was wrong about Trevor. He has a good head on his shoulders, even though he grew up poor. But hes very dedicated to his mother, sister and his niece (she calls him Uncle Panda). Kate has fun with Trevor, even though theyll go their separate ways because Trevor is touring and a West coast type of guy, while shes a mid-west small town girl. But Trevor doesnt want to give Kate up. Hes even willing to try a long distant type of relationship if Kate is up for it. She gives it a shot, which leads to some great surprises for Kate, which also involves the possibility of falling in love with another great man.True North is the type of romance that doesnt have a lot of drama and tension. The biggest issue here is Trevor and Kate trying to make it work between them. Kate is a great heroine. Shes independent, headstrong and very mature. Shes had some hard knocks in her life, mainly with her husbands death, but she carries on. Trevor is a great influence. At first hes difficult to connect with. He acts a certain way, which doesnt really impress at first. But then his personality changes for the better. It was a bit jarring for me because the first quarter of the novel I felt Trevor was too one-dimensional. It wasnt until he and Kate became intimate and a solid couple that he grew one me. Trevor might be the draw for readers, but True North shines because of Kate.The love scenes crackle with emotion, and there are some lighthearted moments that really work here. Even though True North is a romance, it had a feel of womens fiction because of Kates insights and the drama that surrounds her.Other than a rough reading start because I couldnt get a handle on Trevors personality and actions, the author turned things around where I ended up enjoying True North by the end.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QTOQ528R8XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OK6U#wasThisHelpful","R3QTOQ528R8XZ","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Julie Brannagh's books are like candy- sweet, tasty and oh, so good. So is the case of Chasing Jillian (Love and Football #5). This is a feel good romance within a sports romance. The hero and heroine start out as friends, who become much more to one another. Their interactions are adorable to the max, and Seth, the hero is a top notch book boyfriend. The heroine Jillian has realistic issues and doubts most women have, but her quirks aren't annoying, but endearing. Watching her come out of her shell with the help of Seth is the big pay off here.Jillian is the new personal assistant to the owner of the Sharks. She wants to make some major changes in her life, specifically lose some weight and stop being a hermit. Because she can't afford a gym membership, she uses the Sharks exercise facility after work. She's caught by Seth, the new linebacker, who just broke things off with his girlfriend who never appreciated him. Jillian thinks she's in trouble for using the exercise equipment, and may be fired because Seth doesn't seem happy that she's there. But realizing he has frightened Jillian, he gives her some pointers to help her enjoy exercising. Jillian is cautious of Seth because he's just so good looking and a hot shot sports celebrity. But Seth seems to be a really nice guy who really wants to help Jillian. The very next day he's there to speed walk with her during her lunch break, and wants to make plans with her outside work. Seth needs a friend, or so he says to Jillian, who just can't understand why he would want to hang out with boring her. But since Seth is pushy (try more like lovable pushy), he gets Jillian to enjoy things outside her comfort zone.Soon Jillian becomes comfortable around Seth, even though she is very attracted to him. Seth thinks Jillian is something special, but doesn't want to ruin their new friendship, so he tries to ignore his growing feelings for her. Jillian is also worried about her job because her boss gives her a subtle warning about dating his players, including Seth. No one wants Jillian hurt, least of all Seth, who wants to be with her all the time. The question is, can they make it work, and is Seth willing to settle down with Jillian who eventually wants to get married and have a family she has always desired because of growing up in foster care?Chasing Jillian is a very enjoyable contemporary romance set in the world of football. Julie writes the best type of heroes. Seth is a prince of a man. He is so in tune to Jillian and her slight self-esteem issues. He thinks she's great as is, even though she wants to better herself, which for her means to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle. Jillian also has a cute kitty Seth also adores. Seth is the type of hero who wouldn't mind snuggling and cuddling in bed. He's also a big giver, which is shown perfectly when he and Jillian take things to the next level.Chasing Jillian is another winner from Julie. I will never grow bored of the Love and Football series. A feel good romance with great characters, plot and setting.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VDXCHL1SPOF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEYI3CS#wasThisHelpful","R2VDXCHL1SPOF9","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jergens moisturizer is my go to for all things lotion, and this green tea oil lotion works very nice. It's best to use after a shower, or even while shaving your legs. The best way is to lotion up your legs first and then use shaving cream. The scent is very pleasing and I could feel the lotion working right away. It's not too oily and it lasts all day long.

"Miss Match by Laurelin McGee aka Laurelin Paige is an adorable, sexy and precious read! I had a total blast reading this one by Laurelin, who writes incredible witty dialogue, as well as a great way to build up the sexual tension between the hero and heroine. This is a much read for contemporary romance readers, and may just be in my top picks for favorite books for 2015.Andrea is in a big bind. She was fired from her job of 8 years, and after suing her former boss for sexual harassment, which she lost, shes broke. She lives with her musician sister whos strapped for cash also. Andrea doesnt have a college degree and very little work experience even with the former job she had. She was hired because she has this sixth sense about people and whether they would be good employee. Her boss used that special skill of hers in a way that made her feel uncomfortable. She cant use her boss as a recommendation or mention the job at all, which makes her job hunting horrible. But then her sister spots an interesting job opening. Some millionaire CEO who runs an IT company is looking for a matchmaker to help find him a wife. Andrea has her doubts, but she doesnt have much of a choice. She goes on the job interview, and its as bad as she imagined.Blake Donovan needs a wife because he has a 10 year plan. Now at 35 hes at the end of his 10 year plan and needs a wife. He thinks a matchmaker can help him find the perfect woman for him- beautiful biddable, lives to serve him etc He has very specific requirements he wants in a wife, which Andrea is shocked at. Blake comes across as a condescending, pretentious prig, who appears to have a low opinion of women in general. He insults Andrea by called her Drea, and refuses to call her by her nickname of Andy because he says it sounds too boyish. Shes upfront why she needs the job, and Blake is interested in what Drea' has to offer him. Hell try her for a trial period, which after a few days he wants a much longer business contract between them because he cant stop thinking about Andy, but more than just his employee. His attraction to her drives him crazy, and he cant help but tease and annoy her. Andrea is attracted to Blake for some odd reason. He doesnt want to let her out of his sight and even though hes dating these woman Andy has chosen for him, which dont work out, he wants to have a sexual relationship with her. Andy is insulted at first, but Blake is one heck of a kisser. So she goes for it, and then it becomes even more complicated for them because Blake is falling for Andy, the one woman who is the complete opposite of what he wants in a wife.Miss Match is a loopy romance. The situation between Andrea and Blake is unrealistic and a bit outlandish, but the way Laurelin has written it, I was hooked right from the start. Blake is not what he seems. He may appear at first to be this rich snobbish douche canoe, but he hides his true self from the world. Hes a secret Downton Abbey addict, loves pinball machines, Dr. Who, sweeping historical dramas and mysteries and sci fi novels. One he lets Andy into his world, hes a big flirt, and a lovable one at that. He loves poking at Andy, which is very sweet.Andy is the type of heroine who is a joy to read on the page. One of my favorite scene is where she gives Blake a corgi puppy because she says a man who has never had a pet cant be trusted, per her mother. Blake takes the corgi grudgingly, acting like hell give it up, but he ends up keeping the pup, and giving the pup a very original name of Puppy.Theres a lot to love with this book. Blake and Andy are on fire together. The initial set up and then when Andy and Blake become friends with benefits may raise some eyebrows, but the way its solved leaves the reader with warm fuzzies.Miss Match is the type of book you should pick up when feeling down.

"Meant to Be (Rightmatch.com #3) by Kathryn Shay has a cute premise, but as the story moves along, it gets boggles down with soap opera type drama that becomes very tedious by the end. The main couple are well rounded, and very personable, but the overall tension and the path to Cole and Beths HEA becomes a bit ridiculous.Cole is a very sweet hero who is a single dad of an almost two-year-old girl. Her mother, who was studying to be a doctor, gave her up to Cole because of her career. Cole has a great job and a very supportive family. Cole has the complete package any woman would love. That woman is Beth. Shes in her mid 40s, a widow with two adult children and runs a inn. For six months shes been talking to Cole on a dating site he owns and runs. Cole has kept a few things secret from Beth. He lied to her, basically. He told her hes in his 40s, but hes in his early 30s, and failed to tell her hes a single dad of a toddler. So when they finally meet, Beth thinks Cole is a single guy who has never been married or has children. Before he can tell her, their passions for one another overtakes them both, and they have sex. Its the best weekend of Coles life and hes falling head long in love with Beth, although hes still lying to her, and she has very fond memories of her dead husband, her first love.When Cole tells Beth his true age, but still not about his daughter, Beth flips out but forgives him. Then she finds out about his daughter, and she gets really mad, and dumps him. But since she cant forget him, she takes him back and theyre all happy happy for awhile, even though Beth wont get close to Coles daughter or hold her. But eventually she caves, and again theyre all happy happy. But then the soap opera drama starts- parents in the hospital and Coles ex-girlfriend comes back to claim their daughter for some reason just to bring more drama to the story. The way things are fixed for the HEA is too pat and eye rolling.What could have been a great contemporary May/December romance with a great cast of characters, and the importance of family, ends up very flat with too many silly type drama moments that ends up ruining a really sweet romance between a nice main couple.Katiebabs","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IHAMADXCBCT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KO9K22#wasThisHelpful","R2IHAMADXCBCT6","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Definition of Icing by Aven Ellis is a cute contemporary romance about two people who have been burned by love before. Because they were hurt this way, they take things slowly and date. Most readers will find Nate, the hero, a too good to be true Prince Charming, but hes really sweet with Kenley. Hes a great book boyfriend and isnt your stereotypical hockey playing celebrity hero that has appeared in other romances of this sort. Hes a hero with a major sweet tooth and no ego!Kenley runs her own company. She makes chocolate for events and parties. Shes studied her craft overseas, and is very smart, professional and dedicated. Shes also very beautiful, which she feels is a disadvantage because people, especially men only see her as this hot pinup, and not the smart business woman she has become. Shes ends up at a photo shoot to highlight her company, which at first goes badly because the photographer wants to sex her up. Nate, the new star for the Dallas Demon hockey team comes to her rescue. He really impresses Kenley and she asks him out. He shuts her down because hes not ready to date. Kenley took a big chance in asking Nate because its been 2 years since she has been involved with someone. She tries to forget Nate, but fate intervenes, or rather her best friend and sister. She ends up meeting Nate again, and this time he apologies for blowing her off and asks her out. She accepts.Nate really knows how to treat a woman. He wines and dines Kenley, impressed by her work with chocolate and her independence. He reveals why he wants to take things slowly- the woman he loved cheated on him. He still has trusts issues. Kenley tells Nate why shes given up on love, but really likes him, so shell give him a chance. Soon theyre talking all the time, texting, chatting via a social media site theyre on, and just dating. Plus they have great make out sessions that doesnt lead to the bedroom right away. Kenley is falling for Nate, but she doesnt want to push him into a commitment or admit she may love him. Also her mother is very critical of Nate as a hockey player who she thinks will end up cheating on Kenley the moment he goes on the road, including Nates sister Holly who doesnt want Nate hurt again. Kenley starts second guessing everything with Nate, who may want the same thing as Kenley, but unless he tells her, shell never know.The Definition of Icing was a very enjoyable read. The first few chapters are very info-dumping about Kenley and are slow moving. Theres too much about Kenleys chocolate career and how she got there. But once she and Nate start dating, the story really works. They have great chemistry together and cute interactions. The sensuality factor for the majority of the story is low-key until Nate and Kenley become more intimate. Even then the love scenes arent over descriptive, but fit with the overall tone of the novel.Fans of sports romance with a heroine who has a very interesting job, and a gem of a hero, will want to check this one out.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGEUP5F1SHH6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X82CUJG#wasThisHelpful","RGEUP5F1SHH6N","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back to You by Priscella Glenn is quite the emotional read. Its a mash-up of young adult, new adult and a contemporary romance that surprising flows well together. The young adult part are with the flashbacks Lauren has of high school over a two year span. The new adult is 8 years after Lauren last saw Michael, the boy she loved in high school. Shes now twenty-five, a teacher studying to get her Masters when Michael walks back in to her life with a 3 year old daughter. Also part reunion story, this is character driven, more so than plot drive, which really works.Back to You is a prefect example of book that does flashbacks well. We see how Lauren and Michael become close and why they rely and love one another. You root for them to get together, even though Adam is a great alternative for Lauren. At one point I thought the story could go either way regarding Laurens decision on who she should choose. The relationship Michael has with Erin is wonderful, and how Lauren becomes important to Erin, and Michaels reaction really tugs at the heart.The ending of Back to You is fairy tale perfect and may make you shed a happy tear. A great read for any romance reader. A true poignant tale.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR079S8594627/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1479103780#wasThisHelpful","RR079S8594627","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Redemption Falls by Kate Hewitt is all about redemption and forgiveness. The redemption factor deals with the main couple. Linnea has returned to her hometown after 12 years after being a nomad. She was a former townie who ended up pregnant at 16 by a college frat boy. Even though her mother was very supportive and not judgmental, Linnea ran away from everything, including her two year old daughter. Linneas mother asks her to return, and Linnea does, hoping to get to know her daughter Ambler (Such a strange name), who thinks Linnea is her wayward older sister she doesnt know. Things are very strained between Linnea, her mother and Ambler.Linnea has a chip on her shoulder, which makes her less than ideal to be around. She is near broke and lives in small cabin, working a store that caters to tourists. There she meets Rob, the new president of the local college. Hes 38, a widower and reminds Linnea of the college boy who got her pregnant. She is rude and not at all friendly to Rob at first. Rob doesnt understand why Linnea is the way she is, but something about her interests him. He grew up right outside Littleton, and his mother still lives there, and in the same house. Rob has demons chasing him also because of his dead wife who was very sick and died. He cant forgive himself for the way he reacted to her sickness and death. Hes trying to move on even though he has a lot of guilt.Linnea and Rob have more in comment then they think. They feel like outsiders and have pasts theyre not too proud about. Rob goes out of his way to be friends for Linnea, which as first she is suspicious of, but eventually she lets Rob in. They become friends around the same time Ambler starts to warm up to Linnea, as well as Linnea making some friends in the community. Slowly she and Rob test their attraction and make some strides into accepted a relationship beyond friendship. But then tragedy strikes Linneas mother. Now Linnea has some very tough decisions not only about herself but of Ambler who is still in the dark about Linnea. Rob is there to support Linnea, but she is scared of accepting his help and his love.Redemption Falls is a more subtle type of romance. This reads more like Womens Fiction. It may take you a while to warm up to Linnea who is very snappish and angry. Rob is a sweetheart who sees how emotionally damaged Linnea is (he has some great insights) and wants to help heal her. Linnea and Robs relationship takes a while to get off the ground and you may find yourself speed reading through some scenes, but if you dont mind a slow pace with the main couple coming together, youll enjoy Redemption Falls. The love scenes are not explosive or too descriptive for those who want something more subtle, sensuality wise with their romance.Redemption Falls has a small town vibe, which I liked. Overall, a solid romance with dimensional characters youll care about.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SDADA2M3OB3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W79RKM8#wasThisHelpful","R3SDADA2M3OB3P","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"No One Like You (Barefoot William #4) by Kate Angell is a fun, fluffy, novel with adorable dogs and a cute main couple who mesh so well together. This would be a great beach read. The interactions with all the characters, especially Rylan's teammates are a real hoot. Kate really hit one out of the park with No One Like You. An easy, breezy and sexy contemporary romance that's a home run.No One Like You is very flavorful in regards to the unique personalities of the characters. Rylan seems to be very cut and dry and not overally emotional. That isn't too much of a fault because he connects so well with Beth and everyone else around him. He thinks first and then reacts. Beth is a lovely heroine with a very kind soul. The way she interacts with Rylan's dog makes for fun reading. Also the secondary characters from Rylan's baseball team are too funny for words. I hope they all get their own books.The sensuality factor is more on the subtle side (PG-13), although the love scenes shouldn't disappoint. I loved how Rylan and Beth got to know one another very well before they jumped into anything. The ending is exactly what a HEA should be.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLAL5S1G3MX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR4V2#wasThisHelpful","R3SLAL5S1G3MX7","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked up The Tornado by Missy Blue (debut self-published author with absolutely no on-line presence anywhere) with some reservations because I was worried this would be another New Adult with a bad boy MMA fighter, walking STD douche canoe hero, and the oh so innocent Mary Sue heroine who is damaged by some over the top unspeakable trauma in her past. Im happy to say that The Tornado proved me wrong. There are some familiar tropes that I usually roll my eyes at, but Missy Blue has a unique storytelling skill, especially with her characters. The reason The Tornado worked for me was because of the main couple. I adored Asher, aka The Tornado. He may be an intense, mega-brooding, F bomb dropping alpha hero, but underneath it all hes a protective gentleman with great morals. He reminded me of the heroes from Nalini Singhs Rock Kiss series, or Lori Fosters SBC Fighters series.Juliet, the heroine is a dancer who moved back to Pittsburgh after being attacked by a serial killer in NYC. She was the only survivor of that horrendous attack. She has severe anxiety problems she controls with medication, and is now fearful of men. But shes a fighter and a true survivor. She works at her parents bakery, bartenders and teaches dancing at the YMCA to save money to buy her own dancing studio. She also has joined a boxing gym where its overrun with men. She goes there dressed as a man to punch a bag. Why she goes there instead of the YMCA thats co-ed and more comfortable isnt explained, but I think it has to do with her proving to herself that she cant live in constant fear. The men there dont have a high opinion of Juliet who they nickname The Loner. Even the owner of the gym, Asher thinks Loner is a strange kid, but he ignores him for the most part.Asher has a small knit group of friends and is respected in his community because of his almost super star status as a champion MMA fighter. Asher is more of a salt of the earth type of guy. Hes not flashy or a showoff. He doesnt sleep around or use his toughness to get what he wants. Asher is what some may call a caregiving alpha hero.One day Loner is bullied by some jerks at the gym, and they find out Loner is a girl, which happens very early on in the story. Asher comes to Juliets rescue, aka Jewel. He treats her with extreme care because the way she acts and the signs shown, proves she has been through some hardships, much like PTSD of some sort. Theres something special about Jewel Asher likes and wants to protect. He wants Jewel to come back to his gym so he can teach her self-defense moves in the hopes shell trust him and become his friend.Jewel is skittish with Asher, but he respects her space and takes his time with her. He doesnt push her into accepting him or even dares to try to kiss or touch her. They develop a relationship that moves very slowly, which Asher does on purpose in order to get Jewel to trust him. Watching Asher with Jewel is sweet and tender. This is the type of man any father would love his daughter to be with. Jewel lowers her defenses with Asher, and he in turn is given something beautiful.Jewel and Asher have a wonderful courtship, which builds into something more. The way Asher is with Jewel is patient and kind and overall sweet. And then Jewel decides to take what Asher is offering, and falls in deep. When she does, watch out because these two are intense and all consuming with their shared passion. Missy Blue can write combustible love scenes without actual intercourse. That comes later. Asher is a king of foreplay. He is an incredible giver.The first half made me sigh. The second half was more about Asher winning a big MMA fight and some intentional soap opera (dum dum dum) drama to keep the story exciting, which I wasnt too gung-ho about. Some may find it eye-rolling. But I did like the aspect with Jewel and her family, including her best friend Ruby. When Jewel tells Asher what happened to her in NYC, you may end up gasping and then crying because what she went through at the hands of a madmen is truly an unspeakable horror.The main reason to read The Tornado is Asher. What an amazing, prince of a hero. Hes everything a romance hero should b,e and is one of my book boyfriends for 2015. Im definitely interested in reading more from Missy Blue, especially if she keeps writing heroes like Asher.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV876ZJHKJU77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W32GGPQ#wasThisHelpful","RV876ZJHKJU77","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karen Erickson writes the best one night stands that become permanent between the main couple. Endless Nights (Vegas Nights #2) is a hot little novella I wish was longer because I had a blast reading it. The first book was about a nurse finding her HEA with a big time actor. This installment is about another nurse finding love with a big time football player.Andrea came to Las Vegas with her two girl friends from some R&R. She ends up at a VIP party and meets Luke, a player for the Seahawks (yes, the football team). As soon as they meet, they have an instantaneous attraction and get hot and heavy very fast. Luke invites Andrea to his hotel suite where they have the hottest night of sex, and carries on for the next 48 hours. These two are on fire for one another. The sheets practically disintegrate when Andrea and Luke roll on them, including the windows steaming up when Luke gives Andrea some loving against one.Andrea thinks her Vegas fling with Luke will end once she returns home. But Luke doesn't want that. Even though they live in different states, he wants a relationship with her. Andrea has to decide if she wants the same.Endless Nights is a near perfect romance novella. Andrea and Luke's chemistry is off the charts. They connect so well, even within minutes of meeting one another. Toward the end there is some unneeded drama I wasn't really gung ho about. Also the HEA is so quick and everything seems to come to a halt. A very abrupt ending. I think the story would have really shined if we have a few more chapters to tighten everything up.Even with my issue with the ending, Endless Night is a hot little read that any romance reader should try.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGXE3T80FD9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLIGAU6#wasThisHelpful","RVGXE3T80FD9C","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Much Space (Twelve Beats in a Bar #2) by K.K. Hendin has a lot to recommend for it. The heroine, Liv is like a breath a fresh air. She is really amazing with her outlook on life. She doesnt fit into any mold based on her personality, including her looks. Shes fat and knows it. As to how fat, were really not told, but she has an abundance of curves. Liv loves fashion and creating clothes, but she works for a witch of a woman at a high end clothing store who keeps Liv in the back because of her weight and attitude. But Liv takes it all in stride. She has a great circle of friends who all love and support one another.Thierry plays college baseball. Hes more of a pessimist about life. He comes from a big family and hes bi-racial- Brazilian and Japanese. Hes bored with baseball and college in general. He cant stand his roommate who is the ultimate manwhore, who at a frat party insults Liv, who stands up for herself. Thierry notices, and is in awe of Liv. He then realizes they have some classes together. He wants to be around her and soak up her energy and light. The quickly become friends, which becomes something more. But then the unthinkable happens to Thierry. His father is laid off from his job, which means Thierry might not be able to stay in school, even with his sports scholarship. Plus a deadly urge he has comes back full force, which consumes him. He falls into a dark depression and only wants to do this urge day and night. All hope might be lost for Thierry, but Liv wont let him turn to that darkness and will help him live again.This Much Space is not your typical New Adult set in college novel. Liv makes this book shine. She may just be my favorite heroine of 2015 so far. Thierry is more in the shadows and not as interesting. His personality dims in comparison when it comes to Liv. Also everything moves way too fast between these two. It feels like everything happens in a week, from beginning to end. Also  there was some confusion on my part as I read. I had to re-read certain scenes because I couldnt figure out who was talking or who was doing certain actions. This is an editing issue that I wished could be fixed.The sensuality factor is very PG-13. There is kissing and making out, but any sex is fade to black. Also the college setting is done very well.This Much Space had its moment of greatness, specifically with Liv who I would love to hang out with, but Thierrys depression that seems to come out of left field, and the speed of things left me a little disappointed overall. The reason to pick this one up is because of the outstanding heroine K.K. has created.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V8MRC68M6L5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQGX8SY#wasThisHelpful","R1V8MRC68M6L5H","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fringe Benefits by Sandy James, the fourth book in The Ladies who Lunch series, is an enjoyable Contemporary Romance about an older heroine who falls for a younger man (a true prince of a guy). But there are some annoying tropes the authors falls back on, such as the heros horrible ex-girlfriend trying to get him back, plus the too fast insta-love that happens in under 4 months with the main couple. But since Dani and Nate were great to read, I think most readers can get beyond that and enjoy the ride.Dani is a thirty-one year old high school teacher who enjoys her job and her independence. Shes stuck mentoring the new teacher, some twenty something kid she thinks will be too needy and annoying. Shes in for a surprise when she meets Nate, a twenty-four year old who is very charming, and handsome to boot. Nate is very sweet and kind, so much so that Dani loves being around him. But there is a slight problem. They both realize they are attracted to one another, which almost comes to a head on the first day when they are locked in a closet together. They almost kiss. Dani thinks its a really bad idea because shes essentially his boss, and the age difference is a big elephant in the room. Nate backs off but has an ulterior motive. He really likes Dani, especially the almost eight year age difference because girls his age are too immature. Hes still burned from his high school girlfriend, turned step-sister (sounds WTF but when its explained, its not so icky). Dani is a mature woman he has connected with and wants to build upon that.Nate needs a place to live, and Dani offers her basement apartment in her house. She thinks they can be just friends. But the attraction is still there and it continues to grow until they cant deny it. Soon theyre in a relationship- aka boyfriend and girlfriend, but Dani still has so many issues, especially when Nates mother puts in her two cents, and his ex-girlfriend tries everything she can to get Nate back.Fringe Benefits is a solid romance, mainly because the portrayal of Dani and Nate, including the other characters from the first three books in this series. These are all people you root for. Dani is very cautious while Nate is more willing to take chances. Watching them come to an agreement about their wants and needs leads to a fun read.The only downside is that the insta-love trope is heavy here and there isnt much drama to speak of other than the roadblocks Dani believes will ruin her relationship with Nate.For an easy type of read with a nice main couple, Fringe Benefits hits the spot.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TSD1X2GN502/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0X7K#wasThisHelpful","R26TSD1X2GN502","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Burning for You by Michelle Dunaway is a cute novel about two regular people who meet and fall in love because they get to know one another first (although the attraction is there right from the start, and the HEA with the I love yous, and all thats involved happens a bit too fast- in less than a month). But if you like hunky firefighter heroes (this hero is modeled after actor, Joe Manganiello), youll enjoy Burning For You.Taylor is in grad school and barely making ends meets as a waitress and photographer. Shes slowly building her photography client base, and scores a big job photographing the Sexy Public Servants Charity Calendar, filled with sexy firefighters, police and other types. She hits it off with Joe, one of the hunkiest firefighters. Joe likes how Taylor works and is attracted to her, but wants to keep it professional between them. He asks her to work for free to create a book for the Burn Recovery Support Group, which will feature pictures of burn victims. Joes sister is a burn victim, and Joe is one also. Because of his scars, which he keeps hidden, hes afraid being intimate with women. He doesnt want their pity. Taylor accepts the jobs, and these two become friends pretty fast. Joe comes from a big loving family, and they welcome Taylor into their fold. Taylor only has her mom, and shes still recovering from an obsessive ex-boyfriend who pops up again after two years, needing to speak to her. As Joe and she become closer, he has to decide if he wants Taylor on a personal level and if they should become lovers, knowing she may turn away in disgust because of his burns.Burning For You has a great message about beauty only being skin deep. Joe has a great package to most of the female population, but he has self-esteem issues because of what happened to his sister and his guilt over it. Taylor doesnt want to be rejected by Joe but she thinks she has inadequacies also. Theres some push and pull between these two, and when they go for the gold with one another, it happens very fast-within a few days of meeting one another.The secondary characters are nice, especially Joes family and his firefighter co-workers. The subplot with Taylors ex seemed tacked on and didnt really bring anything worth while to the story as a whole. The HEA is sweet as can be, but again happens so fast.Burning For You doesnt have burning, smoldering love scenes, but its still an enjoyable contemporary romance with characters you sympathize with.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7JQFVD1XHDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R69XSPW#wasThisHelpful","RL7JQFVD1XHDO","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anna is a successful author from Canada who has come to stay in England for a working vacation of sorts because one of her books was made into a movie, and its filming there. Anna isnt a big people person and has panic attacks in large crowds. She doesnt make friends easily but it looks like England may be a nice change for her. She makes friends with some of the actors in the movie. Ben, one of the actors in the movie, is a big deal and has obsessed fan girls. Anna has a small crush on him, like most women, but she keeps her distance from him because hes Hollywood and shes basically a boring hermit. She meets Ben under very embarrassing circumstances. Someone has drugged her drink at the movies after party. Ben comes to her rescue. The next morning she is mortified, but Ben and the other actors who watched out for Anna are very nice. (for some reason the drugging of her drink was dropped and never brought up again). Ben is a big fan of her books and thinks Anna is sweet, although he thinks they wont have anything in common, but they could be friends for the short time shes in England.Anna and Ben become very close over the next few weeks. He loves hanging out with her at her rented apartment just watching movies or cooking. They develop a very nice friendship that is borderline girlfriend and boyfriend. Ben begins to have stronger feelings for Anna, and she for him. But both are stubborn and wont take the next steps to become lovers. Anna is afraid shell be attacked by Bens fangirls, who are very loud and outspoken about who Ben should date and be seen with. But Ben helps Anna become more comfortable in her skin and makes her go out in public more. Then he invites her to his sisters wedding, and thats when things really change for both of them. But can Anna deal with Bens celebrity status when she starts to get death threats from his crazed fans, as well as their mean and rude opinions about Anna and her looks? Will Anna move to England to be with Ben, giving up her life in Canada?Limelight by K. Ball was an entertaining read. Ben is very sweet and not at all egotistical when it comes to his status as a Hollywood leading man. The way he treats Anna is lovely. Anna is the one I had issues with. Shes from Canada but sounds too British and exactly like the rest of her counterparts. She also has deep emotional and self esteem issues that after a while become tedious because theyre always front and center. Eventually she takes dancing lessons because of a dare with Ben to get him to quit smoking. I thought that was a nice touch, but Anna was constantly worrying about having a panic attack or not being good enough to be with Ben. Things went a little overboard when Ben and Anna go to the theater, and a mob of a thousand women are waiting outside for Ben. They swarm him and Anna, in order to get to him, and Anna is almost trampled. That seems too much, especially since Ben isnt really this global sensation.Theres also a side plot about Anna standing up for herself in regards to her agent of ten years, and the publisher who constantly white washes her covers. It was interesting to see more about Annas job, rather than Bens.The sensually factor is more PG-13-ish and a good tone for both adult and teen readers. Anna and Ben start things rolling as they become intimate, but the middle and end of their love making is left to the readers imagination.Limelight should appeal to fans who like an opposites attract trope regarding the main couple. Most will connect with Ben, who is a sweetheart, while Anna plays second fiddle to him. The outcome of their romance has a very typical HEA.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1HSHL1IQXEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRML4N6#wasThisHelpful","R3L1HSHL1IQXEO","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beth Bolden has one of the best contemporary romance voices Ive read this year. Getting Lucky is her second release, and really hit the sweet spot. Whereas her first release, The Lucky Charm was more of a sports romance, Getting Lucky is a small town romance set during the winter holidays. This read like a screenplay for a television show, and reminded me of Gilmore Girls. The romance was more on the sweet and tender side, even though there are some great love scenes, but nothing too raunchy or over the top purple prosy.Noah, the hero is suffering from migraines after hes hit with a ball in the head. Hes a big shot baseball player who visits the small town where Tabitha, his ex-girlfriend/lover of sorts grew up. He ends up meeting her sister, Maggie, a caf owner and baker. She loves her small town life and everything about it. She isnt too thrilled to meet Noah, who seems to be in love with her flighty sister. You soon find out thats not the case (thank you for not taking that silly trope and running with it into the ground.).Noah decides to remain in Sand Point for a while. He ends up buying a fixer upper of a house close by. He also tries to get on Maggies good side, not because he wants to get in touch with the elusive Tabitha, but because he really likes Maggie. She, in turn, also likes Noah and they start to have a little romance. Its more of a slow courtship between the two. Maggies best friend Cal isnt happy about Noah. Could Cal have feelings for Maggie? Or maybe hes hiding another secret involving Tabitha who suddenly shows up out of the blue.Getting Lucky is a feel good romance. Noah and Maggie are wonderful characters. The romance here is very believable. Noah and Maggies attraction, and steps to act on it was enjoyable to read. Beth is becoming one of my favorite contemporary romance authors who can complete with any of the big time traditionally published authors writing the same type of settings and couples.If youre looking for a fresh new author, try Beth Bolden and The Lucky Charm and Getting Lucky.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291QK5I4KCIJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QB2RD74#wasThisHelpful","R291QK5I4KCIJD","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Almost Like Love by Abigail Strom is exactly what I like in my contemporary romances. Kate is a children's television writer who gets fired because her shows is tanking in the ratings. That same day her fianc dumps her for another woman. He blames her for him cheating because she's boring and also a bit of a nerd/geek because she love comic books. Kate is sick of being walked all over and goes to a club to pick up a bad boy she can use for sex.Unfortunately her night goes downhill when her former boss, Ian, the VP of Programming is at the same club. She wants nothing to do with him, but he overhears how she's on the prowl for a bad boy. Ian feels he has to save Kate from making a mistake because she's too kind and sweet. He offers himself in the role. He does have tattoos, and even borrows his friend's motorcycle. He feels guilty for firing Kate, but that's the biz. He offers her a job as his young brother's babysitter (their parents died in an accident recently and Ian is his teen brother's guardian) until Kate can get back on her feet. She accepts, not that she needs the money, but when she hears about Ian's brother being too quiet and closed off, she decides to help.Slowly Ian and Kate form a friendship. He helps her out when her pathetic ex-fianc comes back around, as well as pretending to be a bad boy toy to impress her friends. Kate finds out Ian was once a big fan of Dungeon and Dragons and why he can't connect with his brother who has become close with Kate. Then there's the issue of Ian's attraction to Kate and how he wants her in his bed but can't commit to her.Almost Like Love was adorable. Kate has a very unique type of personality and surprised me with her attitude and the way she handles Ian, who at first comes across as this straight laced TV executive. Ian is far from being a bad boy. He has more beta tendencies then alpha. I really liked Ian and his brother's interactions, including the healing process between them.Almost Like Love is a sweet little, feel good story.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9ZS589JYIH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6NJZY8#wasThisHelpful","R3C9ZS589JYIH1","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unlit Star by Lindy Zart has a Nicholas Sparks feel to it, so if youre a fan of Sparks romances, youll enjoy this book. Unfortunately for me, I had a big issue with Delilah, the main protagonist. Delilah has always been an outcast, or so were told because of her quirky fashion sense and outspoken nature. She is portrayed as a very cold and standoffish girl, who although was valedictorian of her high school, she hated studying and reading because she felt she had to succeed. She doesnt have any real emotional connection to anyone, not even her mother. But for some reason, Rivers, the most popular student at Delilahs school makes her take notice. He never treated her badly, unlike his girlfriend who was once Delilahs best friend, who became her enemy because Delilah knows a dark secret Riverss girlfriend has. But the girlfriend is finished with Rivers because he has emotionally cut himself off from everyone because of a horrible accident. He cut up his leg because he fell off a boat.The first half shows Delilah cleaning his parents house, and Rivers brooding around. Delilah cant help but notice oh woes is me Rivers, and snarkly comments on is situation, but she cant help but be attracted to this scarred, handsome boy who never noticed her in all the four years they went to high school together.One day Rivers (his nickname, not his real name) tries to drown in backyard pool and Delilah saves him because he still has a future, unlike Delilah whos running out of time. Why is Delilah running out of time? That is the major twist the reader needs to figure out. When they do, they should cry buckets of tears because Delilah finally has found a deep connection with someone- Rivers.I wish I could say Unlit Star made me bawl like a baby, but I just couldnt connect with Delilah and her issues that feel selfish and a bratty. Rivers is more like wallpaper here. His personality is very bland and a stereotypical love interest found in more new adult romances that Unlit Star tries to embody. The overall story didnt engage me. I felt like there was something lacking that needed to add more depth to Delilah and Riverss relationship. When all was said and done, I just couldnt believe these two developing such a bond that they would fall in love with one another. Also the tragic element didnt really work for me. It felt added on just to bring forth an emotional response from the reader.Unlit Star left me with a ho-hum reading experience. If you want to cry yourself silly over tragic young love, look elsewhere.Katiebabs","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKX0O60NESSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWJY90O#wasThisHelpful","R1CKX0O60NESSI","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good Girl by Mary Kubica is about a kidnapping. The tale mainly highlights Mia, the young woman who was kidnapped and found after three months in a cabin in the woods with her kidnapper, who was shot and killed by police. Mia has selective amnesia, preferring to be called Chloe for no reason. The aftermath of her abduction has not only changed her life, but her dedicated mother Eves, as well. The story begins in the before, which is before the kidnapping and then in the after, which is the present. The back and forth between both the before and after is from the POVs of three specific people- Eve, Gabe, the detective on the case, and the kidnapper, Colin.Eve is the one character you sympathize with the most. Shes a loving mother whose her heart breaks for Mia, her youngest daughter. Her eldest daughter and husband are  unsympathetic to what has happened to Mia, almost blaming Mia for her abduction because she was a rebellious teen. Eve wants answers and turns to Gabe to find them. Gabe is like any detective who is dedicated to the case hes given. He forms a friendship with Eve, trying his best to find Mia and her kidnapper. Colin is not a true villain or even that bad of a guy. We see through his eyes in the before why he was hired to kidnap Mia, why he takes her to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and why he ends up keeping her and not letting her go.Mia is shown through others eyes, such as Colin and Eve. We only find out who Mia truly is at the very end, and that is up for discussion. Its left for the reader to decide the reasons for Mias kidnapping and the aftermath because there is a big twist regarding Mias capture.I figured out one major twist very early on. The other was unexpected. I give the author major kudos for keeping the mystery and almost suspense like atmosphere regarding Mia and what has happened to her going until the very end. The Good Girl has been compared to Gone Girl. I can see why because the readers will end up having a lively discussion on the characters motivations and the somewhat shocking twist ending.The Good Girl is a solid read and should appeal to fans of mystery and suspense.Katiebabs","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QH7XQ8IG31P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IB5BSBG#wasThisHelpful","R1QH7XQ8IG31P9","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is horribly written and needs a good editor STAT. It reads more like a first draft and some girl's fantasy after watching one too many Disney movies. Gabriel, the man ho hero is a billionaire at 25, which in itself is ridiculous. Apparently he is mega rich and a CEO because of his family who hands over a corporation, no questions asked. He and Emma went to high school together, and at prom he crooks his finger and she has sex with him. It's the best night of her life and she has as many orgasms even though she was a virgin. There's no explanation why she would lose her virginity to a walking STD horny guy. She dumps him as fast as she can because she's not sticking around, panting to for him because he'll never change his man ho ways, all at 17.8 years later Emma and Gabriel meet in an elevator, and this is where it gets creepy. Gabriel this world renowned lover and business man not only becomes a love sick, immature stalker, but acts like he's in high school His personality doesn't make any sense. Also he loves calling women ""dear"" and ""my dear"". What present day 25 year old guy uses that endearment? One moment Gabriel tries (but fails) to act as this suave, debonair man, but then reverts back to this tween personality. The way he treats Emmma is disturbing. He won't take the word ""no"" for an answer. Within minutes of seeing her in the elevator, he's all over her. He tells her he won't leave her alone until she agrees to do whatever he wants. She agrees and he takes her on a Cinderella type of shopping spree. Then he moves into the empty apartment next to her and copies her apartment key so he can come and go as he pleases. He then lashed out after getting drunk because Emma won't give her entire heart and soul to him because he's too rich and has a walking STD past. Gabriel is a pathetic sap.Emma and Gabriel talk and talk some more. There's no sex or hardly any foreplay. Nothing about this book or these two characters are appealing. It's very weak storytelling and writing period.Mad For You is bad and lame. Don't torture yourself by reading this sad attempt at writing.Also, this isn't a New Adult novel. The characters are 25, independent and settled in their lives,","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJGU4FLHJQRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLR7FOI#wasThisHelpful","RCJGU4FLHJQRK","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Shandali Yoga Towel is very soft and comfortable to lay on. It does shift, and you may slip when you move into various Yoga poses. It's good for mat Pilates, as long as you have another mat under the towel. Those who are used to sturdier Yoga mats may want to look elsewhere because this towel doesn't have enough traction.

"Killer Queen (Painted Faces #2) by L.H. Cosway is for the fans of Painted Faces, one of L.H.s best novels to date, If you loved Painted Faces, you will adore Killer Queen. Nicholas, the main protagonist is such a saucy, sassy man ho (until he meets his Fred, the main protagonist of Painted Faces), honest without a filter, sweetheart. I love his personality and his lust that turns to love for his Fred. Revisiting these two was like a breath of fresh air. I wasnt bored at all, and I loved seeing certain scenes from Painted Faces in Nicholas POV.Nicholas still has a love for Freds breasts and her lady garden. I cracked up during the explanation of why Nicholas doesnt go near the lady garden with his mouth, as well as a scene toward the end of the book when he and Fred arent speaking. It involves him seeing Freds breasts again, which he thinks have gotten bigger and better because he hasnt seen them or touched them in so long. He is enamored of Fred period, although her boobs are an added plus for him.Nicholas is such a hoot, a lovable hoot. But we also see his moments of depression and some angst because of his past that led him to becoming a drag queen performer. You really get a good feel on who Nicholas is based on his internal thoughts and feelings and why he acts the way he does.The ending is so AWWWWW. This is the type of book that you want to hug and hold close while you sing show tunes. Another winner from Ms. Cosway. I would recommend you read Painted Faces first and then Killer Queen.Katiebabs","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDGAWEVUFTKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEY479S#wasThisHelpful","R1DDGAWEVUFTKM","A1AKQ1YUS4BT82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKQ1YUS4BT82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Durable double sunglasses holder.  The clip is wide enough to fit on a variety of visors from thin to the ultra thick visor. It will attach without damaging the visor.  I have had a few unsavory sets of holder in my past that either would hold my glasses so tight I could not open the clamp to get the sunglasses out and ended up throwing the holder away.  One time I had a visor clip hold the visor so tight is caused damage overtime.  This clip is not like that.  It has foam inside the clamps and softly holds on to your glasses.

"My Mom has high blood pressure and the prescription medications made her sick.  She has been doing alright so far with taking these.  This is a 90 day supply with 13 all-natural ingredients.  It is amazing to me how all natural ingredients can benefit your body the most.  I am knew to the whole aspect of healthy dietary supplements that benefit your health.  I am used to going to the doctor and receiving some medication that I can't pronounce and the chemical compounds are really harsh on your body in the long run and have a lot of negative side effects.  With an all natural supplement like this you get ingredients like Niacin, garlic, Vitamin C, hibiscus flower, olive leaf and hawthorn berry extracts , which are known for their anti hypertensive properties.  You get ingredients like Vitamin B6, Uva Ursi, Juniper Berry, and Buchu Leaves that are all natural diuretics, which can help rid your body of excess fluid.  They also include the green tea, which in addition to its many other benefits helps to relax blood vessels. This supplement is proudly made in a FDA approved facility in the USA backed by a 100%  money back guarantee.Even though it has worked for my Mom, it is always advised to use caution when taking new supplements and talk to your doctor about the benefits of an all-natural supplement and how it can help you and your body.

"I have an iPhone 6 Plus and this charger works perfect for my demands.  Over the weekend I grabbed one of my other external battery chargers and it did not even charge my iPhone 6 plus 75% before it went out on me.  I was super disappointed.  With this 12000mAh portable charger I can get several full charges on it before I need to recharge it.  I have tested about a dozen of these types of chargers.  Sometimes when dealing with portable chargers you get a defective charger and this one comes with a full 1 year warranty.  Buy with confidence and the seller offers great customer service.  Portable chargers have a longevity of 500 plus recharges before it needs to be replaced.  I am not sure of the exact number of recharges for a 12000mAh. The URPOWER 12000mAh offers two output options of USB 5v 1A & 5v 2.1A.  This portable charger is great because it has overcharge, overvoltage, overcurrent, and short circuit protection.*****Overcurrent Protection Function: *****In order to protect your device and the power bank from burning out, the product has a overcurrent protection function for it.  Meaning you can't charge two high wattage devices simultaneously.For example, you can not charge a Galaxy Note 2 and tablet at the same time.  If you do so you may cause your power bank to malfunction.  1 item has to be able to charge at a 1A, while the other charges at 2.1A.I have been using this charger for about 10 charges on my iPhone 6 plus and have not had any problems.

"This is a great 4-in-1 charging cable.  I use it for my car since we are always on the go and everybody has different technology they take on the road with them. I love the nice flat and flexible design that is tangle free. This premium all in one cable has a 30 pin, 8 pin, micro USB and mini USB ports to support many needs.  It has an amp load of 2.1 and does not support charging many high amp accessories at one time.  This cable is so you can decrease clutter in your office, home or car.  Great design and functionality.

"These are a great set of headphones.  They have a superior sound and comfort.  They have more treble than base.  Which is perfect for my teenage daughter.  She LOVES them.

"This is a great bamboo cutting board.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks and it works great.  I love the handle because I store my cutting boards at an angle under my counter and the handle makes it easy for me to grab when I am getting dinner ready.  I like how one size had the groove for liquids to seep into instead of spill on my counter top.  Bamboo is great because it resist bacteria and contamination.  I have been using bamboo products for almost 10 years now and they hold up very well under a ton of use.

"I received an email from the seller because I do quality testing and reviews.  It is an oil free eye cream.  It is lightweight and disipates quickly.  It comes in a 1fl oz glass bottle with pump.  I don't have dark circles so I can not testify to that aspect of the product.  9 ingredients are included in this eye cream. They are: water, red wine polyphenols, grape seed extract, hazel extract, collagen, propolis, vitamin c, arbutin, ylang extract.* Red wine polyphenols aka resveratrol extract works to replenish free radical loss, resulting in tighter skin and less wrinkles.* Grape seed extract: protects collagen and elastin in skin (anti-aging)* Hazel extract:  witch hazel extract reduces pore size, tightens skin, treats discoloration, puffiness and swelling under eyes.* Collagen: Believed to help reduce signs of aging, wrinkles, crow's feet and sagging skin. (Despite their popularity, not proven effective and might not be safe for all individuals, depending on exactly what it contains.). This is probably why there are several negative reviews because it can cause skin irritation in some people.* Propolis aka bee glue is an anti-inflammatory for the skin and protects against bacteria, viruses and fungi.  Rich in vitamins, minerals and amino acids.* Vitamin C: improves tone and texture, protects against UVB rays and can help combat sun damage and under eye wrinkles.* Arbutin aka bearberry is a skin brightener and lightener.  Will lessen the appearance of dark spots overtime.* ylang extract aka ylang ylang is a natural skin balancer correcting both oily or dry skin and is beneficial when treating acne.I saw there were several negative reviews and wanted to research thoroughly each ingredient in this eye cream so you can make an informed decision of this is the right product for you.  I am a true person, have tested the product successfully over a period of time and have noticed changes in my skin. This is not a fake review and I did not and do not get paid to review these products.  If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will answer in a timely manner.* I received this PUNCH product for quality testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3336WJX8GU49H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4ZERGG#wasThisHelpful","R3336WJX8GU49H","A2ODVNRVGYNNKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODVNRVGYNNKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This moisturizer works great for me because I have naturally oily skin.  I LOVE, LOVE the smell and was surprised some other reviewers did not.  It smells exactly like an orange blossom toner I have and that is why I like the smell of this moisturizer so much.  I prefer it over the rose smelling moisturizers that bothered my asthma.  It contains some really great ingredients to renew the skin cells and to decrease the size of pores.  Witch hazel is the actual ingredient to reduce pore size and it is in the Punch cleaner and oil-free moisturizer.  It is packed with organic juices, seeds and extracts to make a perfect combination for many skin types.  Just make sure to read the full ingredients list to ensure you are not allergic to anything in them.  It has a 3 year shelf life!  It is in a sophisticated glass bottle with pump.
